Instead of the (current) picture on Amazon where the phone is placed vertically, you actually use the stand with the phone placed horizontally.  Then the charge / sync cable goes through the hole and you can charge from the side.  When used in landscape position this stand does make more sense so I'm upgrading this review from 2 stars to 4 stars (which I rarely do, but in this case user error) with a star off for lack of documentation.  Manufacturer has said he will include directions and I would also encourage him to update the photos on Amazon with more examples of how this can be used.  The wood quality is indeed good and it's a sturdy little stand.  I'm trying to think of when I'd actually use this stand... perhaps for Facetime chats.  I also think it would be useful for someone in an open office environment if they want to keep their phone on their desk and see alerts / notifications easily.  Hope this updated review helps.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI am throwing this stand in the garbage.  While it's crafted of a nice wood, it is not functional as near as I can tell.  It does not come with instructions and as you can see from the product description, even that is confusing since the English is poorly translated Chinese.  The iPhone sits on the stand just fine, but when it's on the stand, there is no way the plug on the bottom  will plug in -- the stand blocks it.  If you turn the iPhone over, the plug is on the top, which just looks strange.  And I'm not at all sure what the hole in the back of the stand is supposed to do.  Also included are four plastic feet, again no instructions, so I affixed them to the bottom of the stand and it began to wobble.\n\nPerhaps someone else will figure out how to work this thing and post a review, but as far as I'm concerned, the out of the box experience was terrible.\n\nSorry, I cannot recommend.\n\nSample provided in exchange for an honest review.", "summary": "Works well if you place phone in horizontally (landscape mode).

Completely and totally and pleasantly surprised.  Yes, I am yet another reviewer who received this car vac for free from the seller because they needed folks to test this out and review it.  I agreed to test it but I was very skeptical.\n\nHere's the thing.  My car is a dog car.  Make no mistake about it, it is filled with dog hair because they ride in the car and come to work with me more often than not.  They aren't per se huge shedders but the car almost always looks like it's wearing a fur coat.  When I bring it to some of the most sophisticated hand car washes around here they always tell me that they doubt if they can get all the dog hair out.  So, with this little thirty five dollar mini vac I just was not optimistic.\n\nIt did a GOOD job.  The suction doesn't feel very strong and in fact it isn't.  But when I was done, the car looked a good seventy or eighty percent better.  This picked up the dog hair that was loose, no problem.  It struggled a bit to wrest the dog hair away from the carpeted mats but it really did good.  I used the attachments to try to free the trapped fur from the carpeting and also to get into much tighter spots.  By the time I was done my car looked significantly cleaner.  I am impressed.  It could stand to have a bit more suction but honestly it did fine with what suction it did have.  And the cylinder that holds whatever particles  you vacuumed up is very easy to open and clean.  I am so tired of these bagless vac that are so difficult you clean that you end up with everything you vacuumed up right back on the floor.  You won't have that problem with this vacuum\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  Is this the best vacuum I've ever used?  No, but it certainly is one of the most practical and easy to use  And it really does a very good job cleaning.  So small and packable that it's easy to just keep in your car and pull out when you need it.

It's not a replacement for a full size vacuum, but it also isn't huge and doesn't need a long extension cord to get to your car.\n\nI find this is good for minor clean up, but insufficient for a thorough deep cleaning. It has a decent amount of suction to it that doesn't struggle at all with small stones and other road grit that ends up in my floor mats. It pulls all the loose debris like that right up without batting an eyelash. It's the ground in dirt and debris this vacuum struggles with. It's not a lack of suction, it's a lack of a rotating brush head that you get on a Dirt Devil hand vac that digs into the carpet and knocks the dirt loose so it can be sucked up.\n\nThe brush attachment does a decent job of knocking some of that ground in grit loose with a little bit of elbow grease, but it's not like using a vac with a rotating brush head.\n\nThat said, this is great for getting up the loose dirt on the floor and cleaning out cup holders and the dirt and chunks of things that end up between and under your seats. So while it's not a deep cleaner, it's a good cleaner for in between the deep cleans.\n\nEverything fits in the bag, not just the vacuum.\n\nInitially I did think the filter was permanently affixed, which would have basically made this a one use machine. But it's just really stuck in the front cone that captures the dirt. I found that the extension attachment worked perfectly to loosen the filter. Just stick the extension attachment it in the front of the vacuum backwards so it slides all the way in and touches the filter cone and give it a tap. The filter pops right out the back of the clear cone piece. (Obviously, take the cone off the motor first). After that it goes back in hand tight and comes in and out easily.\n\nUltimately I like this thing. It's small enough to store in the trunk and powerful enough to clean up anything that's not ground into the floor mats and carpets. If you're looking to thoroughly clean your car, you'll be disappointed.

Young", "reviewText": "This a phenomenal little emergency pen. The build quality is rock solid--it's a little tube of stainless steel. The magnetic cap is plenty strong. I keep it on my key chain, and the pen has never once come loose or fallen off. The magnet is strong enough to give you a very satisfying snap when you insert or remove the pen. Inadvertently detaching the pen is quite unlikely. At under 3 inches long, it fits nicely in my key chain with my car keys. You can use any standard multi-pen refill. I use Fisher Space Pen U1F or U4F universal refills.\n\n----------------------\nEDIT: March 15, 2016\n\nSo this is still the best tiny keychain pen. The magnetization on the cap is strong and solid, and the pen is shorter than my car key. However, there are a few changes to the design since I last ordered this pen in late 2014. These details are noted below and in the pictures that I have uploaded.\n\nFirst, the picopen has increased in length from a bit over 3\" to now a bit over 3.25\". In addition, the thickness of the pen has increased from what used to be approximately the thickness of a standard USB cable to what is now just shy of the thickness of a 6.35 mm audio jack... or a little bit bigger than the grounding prong of a three-prong electrical plug (sorry, I don't have a caliper handy for better measurements).\n\nSecond, the design of the top of the pen has changed slightly. As can be seen in my pictures, the older Picopen had a tiny lip at the top of the pen, where it connected with the cap. The newer design is a smooth cylinder.\n\nThird, the cap design has changed quite substantially. In the older design, a magnet was attached just inside the cap rather shallowly. When you put the cap onto the pen, the magnet inside the cap gripped onto the lip of the pen (see pictures). With the newer design, the cap is nearly twice as long, and the magnet is recessed much deeper within the cap. Because of the recessed design, the newer cap slides down the shaft of the pen nearly a quarter inch more. Also, as far as I can tell, the magnet on the newer pen is a fair bit stronger than on the old pen. These design choices make it much less likely for the pen to accidentally become detached and fall off your keychain (though that never was a problem for me with the old pen).\n\nFourth, the mechanism for gripping the ink refill has changed on the new pen. On the old pen, the refill just slides in. It's a lightly firm fit, but it feels as though you're just sliding the ink refill into a cylindrical metal tube. You slide the refill in all the way until it hits the back of the pen and stops. The new pen is quite a bit different. Though I am unable to see inside the shaft of the new pen, it feels as though there is a spring that grips the ink refill as you slide it in. The spring resists the ink refill from going into the pen shaft at the very top, but once you have the refill in a little bit, it slides in very firmly. When the ink refill is inserted all the way, pushing on the top of the refill reveals a little bit of springiness. I'm sure everyone has used a retractable pen at some point in their life that, when they press down on a piece of paper, the ink refill has a very small amount of give/springiness. The new Picopen is like that, whereas the refill in the old Picopen is rock solid and has no give. I assume there is probably a small spring underneath of the ink refill that you compress as you push it in which causes this.\n\nFifth, as mentioned above, I use Fisher Space Pen U1F/U4F pressurized refills for my Picopen. Even though the U1F/U4F are standard multipen sizes and are almost exactly the same size as the ink refill that comes with the Picopen, the refill gripping mechanism in the new Picopen strongly resists accepting the Fisher refills. You have to wiggle and push the Fisher refills pretty hard to get them past the initial resistance of the new Picopen before they will slide in, and as you do so, it feels as though you might break whatever spring is inside of the new Picopen. Perhaps this problem will fade with time as you put some wear and tear on the new Picopen. I suspect that reason for the difficulty in getting the Fisher pen refills into the new Picopen is because the tip of the Fisher refills are capped--since they're pressurized--whereas the ink refill that comes with the Picopen has a hollow end (see pictures).", "summary": "Still the best keychain pen, but changed manufacture w/some differences", "unixReviewTime": 1414454400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2014", "reviewerID": "AIF78X3QVRR4E", "asin": "0991557557", "style": {"Color:": " Stainless-Steel"}, "reviewerName": "Sleepy", "reviewText": "I really like this pen!

I did get a copy of the factory manual - it runs about 15$ more than this if you get the electronic version (probably preferable to the paper copy actually - easier to search).  The haynes manual is a few hundred pages - factory manual is over 2000 pages!  So, this manual just won't be as complete.  That said - the haynes manual will probably do fine for most repairs.\n\nThe factory manual has diagrams, not pictures, so it's easier to see what the instructions want you to do, and where things are.  However, the pictures really aren't that bad in the Haynes manual.  To those that complain about it - get some reading glasses?  They seem perfectly good to me.\n\nI've seen lots of complaints about the paper being too thin in other reviews.  Sure, it's a bit thinner than perhaps the average book (maybe similar to a newspaper), but still perfectly usable.  If you are ripping the pages or pulling them out of the manual - my question to those that say this sort of thing - have you used a book before?\n\nI've done 3 recent services on our hondas\n\n1) Engine mount replacement\n2) radiator flush\n3) EGR valve replacement\n\nI used the factory manual instructions to do the mount replacement, but I checked the Haynes manual to see if it was what the factory would recommend.  Engine mount replacement details looked spot-on, it is just how I did it (and actually made the suggestion the factory manual did not - which was instead of using a lift, to support the engine with a floor jack under the oil pan - this worked perfectly for me).  The only thing that was a bit annoying is that you only seem to get the general bolt torque guidance in the front of the manual.  Factory manual specifies an exact desired value per-bolt on their diagrams.\n\nRadiator flush is just the same really as factory manual.\n\nEGR valve replacement was a snap - hardly worth mentioning.\n\nSo, from the recent work I've done, the Haynes manual is actually quite good, and lines up pretty well with what I see in the factory manual.  Seems to me that you should be able to perform most services to your car with this manual.  But, if you want the best of the best - you may want to go with the factory service manual (available on amazon).\n\nI give this 4/5 stars, as the factory manual isn't that much more, and is simply more complete.

But it gives technical details that are hard to find in an authoritative way elsewhere. A good value.\n\nEvery car owner should have the Haynes manual for their vehicle.", "summary": "A Solid Haynes Manual, but a bit of a stretch for the number of models and years it covers", "unixReviewTime": 1356220800}, {"overall": 3.0, "vote": "16", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "09 13, 2012", "reviewerID": "A49W7XK0KETAT", "asin": "1563928493", "style": {"Format:": " Paperback"}, "reviewerName": "WanJae", "reviewText": "I've used Haynes' and Chilton's books for years, but this isn't their best effort.  I have a few big complaints.\n\n1) A very, very great deal of information is generic automotive data that's probably copied and pasted between all their books, and in a couple of instances, I found some of this generic information that wasn't particularly correct in the case of Civics.\n\n2) The book spreads itself across multiple *generations* of Civics and Civic body styles AND tries to tackle CRVs at the same time.  It's just spread too thin.  It's sometimes difficult to hone in on the data that's appropriate for your vehicle.  It doesn't seem to cover Si's at all.\n\n3) I hate to disagree with most of the other reviews, but the book doesn't dig very deep.  Too many systems explanations give only a cursory overview, 101 level troubleshooting (check the fuses, check the seals), then we're admonished to take the car to a dealer if we still have issues.  This is the treatment given for systems as simple as the power locks and emissions.\n\nIf you're only doing simple tune-up work, and you're maybe after an easy-difficulty repair or two, this book might work.  If really want to learn about your car in depth, or you want to make sure you don't get caught short in the middle of a job with insufficient or incomplete information, or if you're going to take on more difficult jobs, you'll want a better book.\n\nFor about 20 bucks more, you can have the complete factory shop manuals right here on Amazon, and they're on CD so you can search the contents and print what you want before attempting a job.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/2006-2007-2008-2009-Honda-Civic-Shop-Manual-CD-W-Etm/dp/B0042XGGCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">2006 2007 2008 2009 Honda Civic Shop Manual CD W/Etm</a>\n\nBishko reprints the Honda official manuals on CD, and you'll have the exact information for your particular car.  All of it.  Enough to tear down the engine and transmission and build it back up to factory specs.  And anything else you can imagine.\n\nGranted, factory service manuals sometimes assume you have access to tools and equipment you either don't have or can't get at all, but I'd rather read, know, and understand than be told \"this is over your head, take it to the dealer\".  Often times, specialized tools can be improvised, or Internet forum wisdom can help you work around your lack of factory test equipment.\n\nAgain, the book isn't terrible, I just expect considerable depth in a repair manual, and felt like I got something that was basically a little better than the owner's manual.  If that's all you're after, perhaps this book is fine.

The material is breathable and has a mesh inner lining to help airflow.  The pants fit just right and have a reinforced rear end for wear and tear and reinforced inner legs for engine heat.\n\nHere's what I was looking for and this suit had it:\nA full velcro flap on the front of the jacket.\nA velcro collar with a corduroy liner and a concealed hood\nVelcro cuffs\nA drawstring waist and jacket bottom\nHighly visible during reduced visibility rain storms\nThe pants come with bootstraps to keep them down and zippers by the cuffs to allow ease in putting on and taking off.\n3M reflective striping throughout the top and bottom\nSuspenders to keep the pant waistband up and under the coat.\n\nIf you get a one-piece suit you'll be most protected since there's no break in material.  If you have a two-piece suit you don't want rain coming in between the pants and the coat.  So it was important to me to find a set that had suspenders or a bib on the pants to keep them tucked up under the coat.  These do just that.\n\nAs for fit, I'm 5'11\" 185lbs.  I wear a medium in most clothing.  I wanted a suit that would fit over my clothes.  So I ordered a large.  A large on my frame fits over my jeans perfectly.  The rain coat fits perfectly over my leather jacket.  If I were to just wear the rain coat over my shirt, I would want a medium.  But because I always use my leather coat when riding, I needed a large size suit to go over my leather jacket.  The collar is the only snug part of the jacket.  It probably should be the only snug part anyway to keep rain from running down your neck.\n\nMobility is fine in the suit.  I can twist my torso and look over my shoulders with very mild resistance from the material.\n\nBottom line: This 2-piece suit is a good buy.  It has suspenders to keep the pants up.  It's high-visibility green.  It fits great over clothes and a leather jacket.  The inner mesh liner provides adequate breathability.  The price is reasonable compared to other competitors.  I have NOT rain tested this material.  But I'm familiar with the material in general and believe it will provide acceptable coverage.  The product claims to be seam-sealed so that no water will leak in.

I am reviewing solely on inspecting them.

Sure, you can buy some cheap 12 gauge or whatever at your local big box store. But I have personally been in situations where the cheap-o cables simply could not carry enough current to jump my vehicle. The cables were too thin to charge the battery in a reasonable amount of time, and could not carry enough juice to turn the starter.\n\nALWAYS buy 2 or 4 gauge. ALWAYS buy long cables. I don't care what anyone says. Cars are low voltage but high amperage. A starter cranking needs a TON of juice. Those dainty little WM cables will not cut it. Enter these cables.\n\nAt 4 gauge, these could probably jump a semi. At 20 feet, you can easily link two cars together even if one is in a difficult spot. When life happens, you do NOT want to be stuck somewhere with cables that aren't adequate.\n\nThese cables fit the bill. The handles also appear to be fairly durable, which is important. I have had cheaper cables have the insulation on the handles flake off. Makes for a painful jump.\n\nOverall I am impressed with the workmanship and specifications for the price.

For the price of a set of cheap Booster/Jumper Cables in a brick and morter store, you can buy extra long and heavy duty jumpers!  First off, don't be the person that not only needs to ask a kind passer-by for a \"jump\" but also if they have jumper cables.  It's MUCH easier to get a jump start if you have your own cables.\n\nNext lets talk about sizing.  Having the longest cable possible is a major plus if your car is parked up against something like a pole or wall, or even parked on a one way street.  The \"booster car\" (the car w/o a dead battery) can pull in close enough to use the cables without having to manuver into some akward position.  Or better yet, you won't have to push your vehicle into a position to be jumped.  If your diving a normal sized car they can even pull in behind you to jump you!  Or if their vehicle is the shorter of the two, they could pull in front.  Now how about gauge?  For those who aren't electricians or engineers, as the number value of gauge decreases, the size and capacity of the cable increases.  So for example 6-ga has about twice as much copper wire as 8-ga, and 4-ga is a about twice as much as 6-ga, so on and so on.  That doesn't mean you double the capacity of wire with every two numbers though.  4-gauge may sound like a lot but it really isn't.\n\nThe technical stuff.  Don't worry if this doesn't make sense, you don't really need to know all of this, but I'm trying to make a point as to why to get the longest and heavist cables you can.  I'm not an electrican but I've worked with it long enough to know a few general rules of thumb.  First of the enemy of electricty is resistance.  Resistance ultimately determines the load a particular wire can carry.  Five things factor into resistance.  Temperature, conductor, voltage, load, and distance.  Temp we can't control, so we have to assume the worst (HOT)...or in other words need heavier cable.  Conductor should be copper, or at least a high purity mix of copper...good there.  Voltage...12VDC is a low voltage system...probably the biggest problem we face.  Since is a low voltage system we have to contend with voltage drop as it travels over the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run with acceptable levels of voltage drop over a particular gauge wire...so again since it's low voltage need heavier gauge wire.  Load (Amperage)...it's a car starter so it takes A LOT of power.  The voltage is a fixed number (more or less) so Amperage is determined by the size of the engine your trying to start.  And you'd be surprised how high that can be.  Even a small engine can be well over 300 Cranking Amps.  That said even a \"dead\" battery will put out some power.  As for distance...this cables selling point is also a draw back.  25' is LONG run for 12VDC.  So like I said in the last line 4-ga isn't as much as you think.  In fact, if you have an engine over 6-liters you should really consider 2-ga for this distance.  So summing up in layman's terms...considering the hot temperatures outside, the fact that it's 12VDC and we need a long cable, and that we're trying to start a car engine (which takes a LOT of power) these are the ONLY cables I could reccomend for anyone driving a small car up to a light truck.\n\nLets talk about how to properly start a car with a drained battery.  Make sure the LAST connection make is the NEG clamp to the \"dead\" car on a frame ground (something metal and NOT MOVING or GOING TO MOVE in the engine compartment.)  Don't attach it directly to the battery's NEG post.  Next lightly rev the engine of the running vehicle for 3 to 5 minutes.  This will put a bit of a surface charge on the dead battery.  Then attempt to start the car.  As soon as it starts remove the cables (starting with the NEG on the car being jumped.)  If you ever have a dead battery for any reason...take it to an auto parts store as soon as possible and have it tested to make sure it still holds a proper charge.  Most places do it for free.  NEVER touch the clamps together once connected to a battery!!!  Doing so could damage you vehicles electrical system, and/or cause fire, burns, explosion of the battery, damages to your cables...\n\nA couple of final thoughts.  Protect your investment.  I bought a cable bag that works really well to keep them from getting tangled with everything in my trunk.  Also keep the twist ties that come with them which will keep them organized inside the cable bag.  And once used, take them home and clean and dry them before storing them once again.  The oils inside of engine compartments can be corrosive to rubber jackets and copper contacts.  These cables are more than worth they weight in gold!

But for me where they fall short is at the clamps and this type of clamp seems to be on MANY cables available today. I could not see it in the photos but the clamps are uneven at the ends because of the extra notch the manufacturer adds on one side to make it easier to connect to side terminal batteries. Also there are NO teeth on the end of the jaws so you HAVE to make your connection using the teeth on the sides of the jaws.  This does not sound like a big deal until you are in a tight situation and have to clamp onto a top post battery straight down, then you have an uneven clamp end and no teeth to grip the post.  I happen to also have a car (a domestic) with a remote mounted battery, not a HOT ROD or modified car, just a stock factory production car where the manufacturer could not fit the battery under the hood for space saving and design reasons and put it elsewhere in the car.  Remote batteries used to be a rare thing on mostly European cars but it is fairly common now on all makes of cars.  With the battery not under the hood or in the trunk I have a Pos. and Neg. lug under the hood at the end of battery cables to jump the car with.  The Pos. lug is surrounded by plastic in a depression to prevent anything from accidentally hitting it and shorting.  Because of this there is little room and I can not get the side of these jumper cable clamps to grab the lug, I need teeth on the end of the jaws to grip the Pos. lug. I'm returning these cables and for $15 more (on sale) than the price of these cables I got the same length, the same 4 ga. wire, clamps with teeth on all 3 sides, even jaw ends, a side terminal connection in the jaws, and they came with a hard plastic storage case, safety glasses and gloves.

These are a heavy duty 4 gauge wire that will last for many years. In fact they might be the last jumper cables you ever have to buy. My vehicle as do most newer vehicles have side battery posts.

Then this year, May 18, 2016, I went up to my attic and it was hot, over 95 degree. I set my thermostat to 90 and it wasn't working. Checked the current and it was getting electricity. Motor died. Call CSH Inc. who was the seller through Amazon. They were very nice and explained that I had to go through Amazon for the 1year warranty even though they were the seller since I bought it through Amazon Prime. CSH said to call them back if Amazon didn't help and they would help me. Amazon said they don't do warranty but would take it back with a 15% restocking fee. Amazon said I could call the manufacturer for the warranty. So I called Lomanco and they honored the warranty with no problem.

You can reuse the fan blade as long as you don't bend it (as in permanently crease it) when extracting the motor from the suspension bracket. Just make sure the fan is relatively balanced, meaning the blades are uniformly shaped from one to the other, before mounting the fan to the new motor. You can set the fan blade on a flat workbench or concrete floor and spin it to evaluate its balance. They're pretty easy to bend back into shape.\n\nTip: I found that it's easier to remove and install the motor with the fan already firmly attached, because access is limited to the Allen set screw once the motor and fan are up in the bracket.

They do make a difference. I have replaced three of these motors since 1985. They probably were good but I didn't know it. These motors are open shaded pole 42 frame motors. They have an oiler wick in the front and rear. There are no bearings. Because of the heat in your attic, the wicks dry. They need to be oiled regularly. Who wants to climb into the attic with 110 degrees in the summer heat and oil your fan motor? Then again, don't they always fail in the summer? These motors, I discovered, don't burn out, they seize on the shaft due to lack of oil, the overload protector overheats, then it turns itself off. But alas, these motors can be fixed. Here's how:\n\nBuy two of these motors to keep on hand. The price keeps rising so you might as well get them now. Attach some bright yellow plastic tape to the outside mushroom cover vent of your attic ventilator so when the tape is moving, the motor is on and running so you can see it from the ground. The next time your vent motor stops when it should be running, the tape will notify you then you'll have to climb into the attic to remove the motor. Remove the set screw on the motor shaft and the three bolts holding the motor to the bracket. Leave the fan blade. Disconnect motor wires from thermostat box and leave attic.\n\nWhat we want to do here is replace the seized motor with the new one but attach longer wires to it and the thermostat box so we can replace the motor next time by removing the mushroom cover on the roof pulling the motor up and out, unplugging it and not have to go into a hot attic to do it again. I use 14 GA. male/female plastic covered push connectors on the wire ends so I can easily unplug them.\n\nYour old motor can be fixed. Run a continuity test with ohmmeter on it. If it has continuity, the shaft/stator is seized. Remove the four bolts from the seized motor and separate the housing. The back part will easily separate. The stator will be seized to the front. Fill coffee can with WD-40 and soak front motor and stator for an hour. Remove and twist stator and front motor housing until stator separates. Clean stator shafts with 0000 steel wool, lube shafts with lithium grease and reassemble.

I would not use it if I were doing brakes all day. The tool is a nice concept - hand held, compact, etc - but it has some engineering flaws.\n\nFirst off, read the instructions.  The tool will probably not work out of the box.  There is an eccentric on the moving handle pivot that allow you to set die spacing and crimp pressure.  If you have it set too high, two things will happen:  1. the dies will cam over, i.e. toggle, and your flare will be off center (see my pic) 2. your tube will get crushed.  The stationary turrent die has a weak detent to hold it in place, and high pressure will cause it to move.  You don't need a ton of pressure to hold soft tubing, especially something like copper tube, or copper-nickel brake line.  Second, you'll probably want a RoFlare DF style adapter if you do double flares. You can't easily fit a standard button style flare adapter next to your tube to measure the initial stickout.\n\nYou can turn the tall hex shaped towers with a wrench to fine tune the initial die alignment, however this is mostly cosmetic. This tool relies on the tube to align the die blocks. Light pressure on the die faces is required to align them right before you close the handle. Turrets need to be checked to make sure they don't toggle.  If you do all that, it makes good centered flares without deforming the tube.  It does leave light marks in softer tube, but it does not affect function.  You'll want to grease the threads on the clamp, and make sure you use the correct lube (brake fluid for brakes, etc) when making your flares.\n\nIf you switch sizes - like going from 3/16 to 1/4 - you may have to adjust the cam again.  You'll also have to adjust it if you switch tube types.  This is why it's ok for home use, but not for high volume use.... too much adjusting.  The whole tool flexes when the clamp is tightened, and since it puts pressure on the edge of the die blocks, they do \"splay\" out. This results in a somewhat pinched tube neck just under the edge of the flare.  Again, not pretty but functional.

More than that, with the speed of a sander or grinder (4500=6000 RPM) will burn your finish right up.\n This Milwaukee has the right speed, and it is variable if you want to go into a different level of polishing, than the automotive level. With 11 amps in the motor, you are sure to have the kind of power that will guarantee a constant speed, even when you have a 7\" bonnet loaded with compound.\n Another great feature is the locking collet. I had a body shop for 20 years, did a lot of high end cars, personally spent more hours on a 7\" polisher than would be believable if I stated it, seriously, and  locking collet would be a dream come true. Most polishers have an allen wrench based nut in the center of them, which holds the rubber backing pad to the shaft. When it is time to change a pad, it is often frustrating, because of the center nut. All you can do to change the pad is hold on to the backing pad, and use an allen wrench. That resulted in a slipping backing pad, sliding around the spindle. To have a locking collet is an engineering dream for a polisher.\n Since polishers require a lot more torque, and beefy components, than a grinder, it is comforting to know that this Milwaukee has helical gearing, and all ball and roller bearings.\n I have come to appreciate the heavy duty build on Milwaukee tools. Their new Lok Tor cordless drills are the highest torque in the industry. Their 11 amp sawzall is the best, and the list goes on.\n I noticed a comment in the editorial review, that a pro might need more speed. NOT. This polisher covers the proper speed. A burn mark in a polished finish, looks like a raising of the material, in a little series of ridges. Another peril of too much speed is a quick burn through the finish, revealing base coats for example primer. I mention this because this is the heavy duty unit. You don't need something faster, or more powerful. You would be hard pressed to find another tool out there that does the job better. The competition, with less power, slower speeds, and that funny handle that goes over the top of the polisher is not what you want. I went into the local home center and felt that handle position just today. It is uncomfortable for polishing. You want your hand out out to one side of the head, just the way this Milwaukee is. They further enable you to choose a side, in the event that you are left handed. It gives you a wider stance with a side handle, which equals better control.\n  All in all this is a five star piece of equipment. It costs a little more than the competition, but the extra money is put in the tool.

The longest single use I got out of it was for a week with hurricane Isabelle-it paid for itself.  Other than that I probably run it 30 hours a year.  I use it to power a 1.5 hp well pump, a refrigerator and the blower on my propane hot water heater.  We can shower, flush and eat-the important things in life!  These three things max it out but get us by. It could have a better wheel/handle design-it's hard to move around.  I had to replace the carbureator (water got in and froze up-my fault) and a low oil pressure switch-which collects sludge and just needed to be cleaned.  The filler cap/gas gauge was useless and the low idle mechanism is screwy.  I added a screw-on oil filter, which it didn't come with, although later models do.  It runs like a champ.  If it meets your needs I'd buy it.  I'm presently on backorder for a 10,000 ($1800) watt, 18 hp Honda engine generator.  My suggestion to anyone buying a generator is-get the chart that comes with  generators and figure out in advance what you want to power and buy accordingly.  Good Luck!\n\nUpdate-11/25/12.  Even champs can let you down.  Based on my info. above I must have bought this in 1998 which makes it 14 years old.  I've been using this, lately, in conjunction with a 10KW generator so that I only used the Generac at night, when there was a power outage, to run the refrigerator since it better on gas.  During Sandy (no power for four days) my Generac died-engine runs great but no electricity.  I brought it into a shop and was told the stator was fried and it would cost more to repair it than it was worth-that assessment costs me $50.\n\nUpdate-3/15/13.  After running an ad on CL, to see if anyone was interested in the parts, I received a helpful response.  There was a local guy, Strasburg, VA, that worked on generators on the side.  He checked it out and determined that the coil was fried.  He was able to double dip (varnish insulation-I was told) a new coil and replace the \"iffy\" control panel, used, for $300.  So, I'm back  in business.  I thought it was a decent deal considering that a new generator, of this size, costs around $600.  I've checked the voltages (120/240) and it works fine.\n\nIt pays to have a backup generator when you consider how miserable life in the country can be without power.  With wood heat that's not the issue but no indoor plumbing when the well isn't working is no fun.  Think about the cost of replacing your freezer/refrigerator food and $300 is good insurance over a number of years.", "summary": "Runs like a champ", "unixReviewTime": 1067385600}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "13", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2003", "reviewerID": "A2ZJQXLSLDUOP5", "asin": "B00004WHKO", "reviewerName": "Upper Michigan user", "reviewText": "I purchaced this generator as a back up unit for my home and for camping.

The unit has only about 8 hours on it so far and I hope this will get better as it breaks in.

If done properly, there is no mess, and the lid/cap keeps oil out of reach, with no exposed oily surface, as the oil drained straight into not just a pan, but an oil container. Fantastic! I wonder why there aren't more products like this.\n\nI read the reviews about leaking and debated over this. However, I saw someone who tried windshield washing fluid cap and it worked for him. I thought it was enough for me to bite, as the top lid doesn't have to be tight as long as I transport the thing horizontally to the nearest recycling center. I got it from a local big box retailer as it is a bit cheaper than Amazon, and that I wanted to see it first.\n\nI made a few observations at the store trying to figure out why this thing will leak, and maybe pick out a sample that will have a better chance not. The recycled plastic of this pan is very cheaply molded, and all of them have warped large top openings to various degrees, so that the top lid won't ever go on flat, if it doesn't slip off first. There's no hope that it will create a good seal.\n\nThe drain cap is also plastic on plastic. Though at the store it could be fastened tightly--both the included cap and a windshield washer fluid bottle cap. That quickly changed though when there's oil--both caps leaked (yes, even the windshield washer fluid cap which has a paper/fiber insert as seal), and couldn't be fastened as it would just slip off the threads QUITE easily. In the end I had to put my latex glove over the opening *and* the threads to force on the cap to prevent a leak, and only barely.\n\nThe smaller drain opening is cut rather unevenly, making it difficult to create a tight seal even with a cap with paper gasket (as in the case of windshield washing fluid. You can forget about the included plastic cap as it'll never be useful). I picked out one with a relatively flat and clean cut, and it still didn't work. Pretty frustrating.\n\nThe saving grace--for me, not for this product-- is that the 4 quarts of oil I drained out just barely cleared the drain lip, creating little pressure on the leaky opening. I had to do transmission fluid drain as well, and since the cap didn't pass the leak test, I had to pour the waste oil to another container before doing another drain. Not quite the \"drain, cap and transport\" ease that I was hoping for. In fact, it made everything quite a bit messier than it had to be.\n\nIt's a great concept, but the execution is absolutely terrible. There should have been improvements over all these years (I think this particular product has been on the market for nearly a decade now?), but that's not the case.

Do not put this in your vehicle, drain it into a 5 gallon gas tank to transport to Autozone.  It's better that way anyway so you don't have to go everytime you change your oil.  When you drain the pan make sure the big lid is facing up the best you can.  You do all this and your floor will stay clean.  Make sure to have a rag to wipe up any small leak you may have.  Another tip too is opening is not huge on this product so if your plug is on the side of your engine's oil pan take into account that the oil will spray out about 8-10 inches.

Did a lot of high end cars, and spent a lot of time behind a polisher. Now I am doing woodwork and need to get the same kind of results. The problem is that with woodwork, most of the time, you are working on smaller, intricate surfaces, as compared to the big flat panels on a car. Consquently a 2400 RMP polisher is not what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately 2400 RPMs is where mile deep gloss arrives. So what to do. I just ordered the Milwaukee variable speed 11 amp polisher. The speed range is 0-2800 with a pre set dial for fixing a setting, so I can slow it down for the delicate areas, and still maintain the option of cranking it up for the larger flat surfaces. I also purchased the hook and loop backing pad. That is where this Porter Cable wool pad comes in. It is difficult to tell just how much nap their is on a pad when ordering from a picture online. My old favorite is a super plush 7 inch tie on lambswool bonnet. By the time you wrap it around a backing pad, it makes for a larger edge than you would normally need for the intracacies of wood projects. That is where these Porter Cable hook and loop pads come in. The texture is very fine and smooth. Very thick and dense as well. The nap is only about 1/2\" deep. That makes it very manageable for tight spaces. It is good for getting a lot of control when working up close to an ajoining surface. Using this pad on a random orbit sander is ok for a gentle rubbing effect. If you are planning on building a solid layer of finish, and polishing it to a deep gloss that is glasslike by using compounds, you will need a regular polisher. The nice thing about these Porter Cable polishing pads, is that they work with either type of machine, as long as they have a hook and loop backing pad.\n  All in all these Porter Cable pads, with their tight yet silky smooth nap, fill a niche for polishing that is very helpful.

Did a lot of high end cars, and spent a lot of time behind a polisher. Now I am doing woodwork and need to get the same kind of results. The problem is that with woodwork, most of the time, you are working on smaller, intricate surfaces, as compared to the big flat panels on a car. Consquently a 2400 RPM polisher is not what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately 2400 RPMs is where mile deep gloss arrives. So what to do. I just ordered the Milwaukee variable speed 11 amp polisher. The speed range is 0-2800 with a pre set dial for fixing a setting, so I can slow it down for the delicate areas, and still maintain the option of cranking it up for the larger flat surfaces. I also purchased the hook and loop backing pad. That is where this Porter Cable wool pad comes in. It is difficult to tell just how much nap their is on a pad when ordering from a picture online. My old favorite is a super plush 7 inch tie on lambswool bonnet. By the time you wrap it around a backing pad, it makes for a larger edge than you would normally need for the intracacies of wood projects. That is where these Porter Cable hook and loop pads come in. The texture is very fine and smooth. Very thick and dense as well. The nap is only about 1/2\" deep. That makes it very manageable for tight spaces. It is good for getting a lot of control when working up close to an ajoining surface. Using this pad on a random orbit sander is ok for a gentle rubbing effect. If you are planning on building a solid layer of finish, and polishing it to a deep gloss that is glasslike by using compounds, you will need a regular polisher. The nice thing about these Porter Cable polishing pads, is that they work with either type of machine, as long as they have a hook and loop backing pad.\nAll in all these Porter Cable pads, with their tight yet silky smooth nap, fill a niche for polishing that is very helpful.

The rivet tightens and pops off.\n\nNow I'm only giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I did have a difficult time with the rivets. I could squeeze but it took a lot of force to get the rivet to pop off. It would be 5 stars if they had a ratchet system or some other way of making it easier to squeeze. But for what it is, it's basic and easy to understand how to operate.

It seems very durable and almost rolls too good. I find myself having to prop up against a tire to do anything that requires too much force or you simply roll away. I like the casters (or wheels are more like it) and it will roll over cords though I don't recommend doing that.\n\nI absolutely love that the creeper and its parts are made in the USA. They even include a little brochure with the detailed list of all the parts and where they are made.\n\nThe only reason I knocked it one star is assembly. After paying over $100 for this creeper - I get it and had to attached the wheels myself. That blows because it is 16 bolts and 16 nuts. Not hard or anything I just would have thought for $100 creeper they maybe could have done this at the factory.\n\nI am 6'4 tall and this creeper is a little short - but then again most items I try to use that involve my height usually are too small anyway. For the average size person I think this would be good.\n\nThe other improvement they should make it the headrest is a really nice soft excellent quality piece but it is mounted too low on the creeper. You have your head stuck between the two ends of the bone which for me is a bad angle unless you are laying directly below your work and I try not to that at all. I find myself resting my head much more on the actual wheel housing on the end of the bone propped up a slight angle while working off to the side or above/below my face.\n\nIn closing - I have done the cardboard/blanket and cheap creeper thing --- this is like a Cadillac over a Pinto - no comparison.

It's too heavy - it is a beast.  My old creeper was much lighter and easier to sling around and hang up out of the way.  2.  The wheel covers, or humps, are cumbersome, particularly when it's time to hang it somewhere.  My old creeper could just catch its wheels on the edge of a counter or board and it would stay.  Not this one.  I put a couple eye bolts on one side to catch two nails to hang on when not in use.\n\nDale Adams still has some work to do, otherwise someone, someday, will come along with a better mousetrap.

First of all, Amazon lists the working range of this unit as .5 to 16 feet. However, the instructions in the box indicate that you should have at least 18 inches in front of the device to work with, with three open feet on each side. I tried parking a car within about 9 inches of the sensor and reset the range per the instructions. When driving up to the unit it gave me a red light to stop at around 16-18 inches...with about 6 inches of car hanging out of the garage! I thought maybe the calibration was off, so I brought the car to within a few inches of the sensors, reset the range, and lo and behold the red light came on at 16-18 inches again. This device is useless in close quarters.\n\nThe second issue has to do with many cars having curved front bumpers (like our Quest mini-van). Because of this it's important that you have at least 6-10 inches of \"play\" in your garage or you might find that one day you don't line up correctly with your curved bumper and leave the rear of the car in the way of the door again.

This ridge can create a pocket under these glueless patches and allow air to escape, since there is no rubber glue to fill the gap.

This is NOT jumper cables. It's the equivalent of a typical 6-amp battery charger.\n2. It WILL actually pump energy into the dead car (verified with test equipment).\n3. It WILL get hot and continue to pump, so disconnect as soon as the light turns green.\n4. Leave the good car's engine running!!! Very important while this device is working.\n5. It is clean, foolproof and easy to use. Perfect for someone who is not car savvy.\n6. Do not start the car with this connected.  Let the dead car's now-charged battery do all the starting.\n\nTo the reviewers that said it took a long time, remember that a battery is like an electrical gas tank.  So when person A says it took 5 minutes and person B says it took 20 minutes, they probably didn't tell you just how drained their batteries were, or if the good vehicle was running or not (it can drastically shorten the charge time).  Just keep that in mind as you read reviews.\n\nNote: I do not work for Amazon nor anyone involved in making this device.  I bought this at the listed Amazon price with my own money.\n\nLong version:\nFirst, these aren't jumper cables.  And the automotive industry has moved away from jumper cables to \"booster cables\" with smaller wires.  The reason why is that direct connecting two separate electrical systems leaves both systems vulnerable to voltage and current spikes which cause damage to computers and electronics.  My decade-old minivan has ELEVEN computers.  Do you want to risk replacing all of those just so you can get your car started a few minutes faster?  Nope, I didn't think so.  So anyway...\n\nSecond, the designers of this device capitalized on several ideas:  one, that every car has a cigarette lighter / 12V accessory port, that port is setup so hooking it up wrong is impossible, AND the fuses for these ports are almost always at 15A or more.  And since a typical car battery charger maxes out at 15 amps anyway, that's a safe and good charge rate.  It's brilliant.  Hooking it up is clean and easy.\n\nSo... here's the technical nitty-gritty:  Yes this thing actually \"pumps\" energy!  I tested this on a car with a battery reading 11.9V connected to another car with a known-good battery and charging system that was fresh off a several-hundred-mile trip and was resting around 12.8V.  Both cars' engines were off and there was no additional draws on either electrical system.  I connected the unit and once the dead car's battery was at 12.6V (proper charged voltage) the light turned green.  At this point the good car's battery had discharged a bit, down to 12.5V.  Just as a test I left the unit connected and to my surprise the good car's battery went down to 12.3V and the formerly dead car's battery was now at 12.95V!  I put a 12V 6A battery charger on the good car's battery and left everything else hooked up to further experiment. Despite putting the charger on, the good car's battery stayed stubbornly at 12.2V while the dead car's battery reached 13.0V!  So this means that the Wagan unit was moving more than 6 amps to the other battery!  At this point I disconnected the unit and just let the charger recharge the formerly good car's battery.  Both cars started right up.  I should also note that the unit got VERY hot and put out a noticeable electronics smell, so don't run this longer than you have to.  Given that it's for intermittent use and heat sinks are heavy and costly, I'm not surprised.\n\nSo... the takeaway is that this thing really works, and it's a genius design.  Make sure your good car's engine is running and don't leave it connected any longer than you need to.", "summary": "GREAT as long as you understand a few things.", "unixReviewTime": 1494201600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2017", "reviewerID": "A3T0UTP50X7NSX", "asin": "B00005OWK2", "reviewerName": "Edward F.

I guess that's fine.\n\nThe product is well built and solid.\n\nI tested the item right away to see if I could charge a depleted battery that was still \"good\" so I left my lights and key turned on until the lights went so dim I could barely see it.  Then I pulled my other car BEHIND the dead car, hooked up a multimeter on both car batteries, *****turned the key to ACC on the donor car (otherwise NO CHARGING)*****, and started charging.  The circuitry actively \"pushes\" the juice from donor car to dead car, so it's not just an equalization between batteries.\nI think there is some sort of timer or energy meter in the circuitry that signals you when the unit thinks you've been hooked up long enough, but it's arbitrary and only a suggestion.  The LED turns from red to green.  Likely a voltage trigger is hit and it turns the unit off, but that does not specifically mean there is enough amperage available to start your engine.  When a battery is charging it can get up to voltage without actually being charged, if you unplug it then, the voltage will likely drop and balance out to match the available amperes over a short time.  This is especially true in the cold or if you have dead cells or need to put distilled water in your battery.\n\nI had to perform the process twice as there had not been enough energy transferred to start the dead car's engine on just one cycle.  I saw this in other people's posts and I just wanted to see it myself so I can act accordingly.  This is perfectly fine.  Just be warned that this is normal and fine.  I have a large battery in the dead car, so this is understandable.  It did turn the engine over a bit, so that's a good sign.  After the 2nd time it started right away.\n\nNOTE:  jumper cables transfer a LOT more juice very quickly, 100's of amps; you can normally jump by working directly off of the other car's battery if your battery is not completely depleted.  This unit will not let you jump directly from another car's battery- it charges your battery.  Your cigarette lighter adapter only lets 10 amps or less juice to charge your battery (10 amp fuse, 10 amp wiring), so be patient.  If you can't easily reach your battery when you raise your hood, this product is for you.  If you have easy access to your battery, then buy some jumper cables and learn how to use them.  It is not hard.\n\nI wanted this for my on/off road adventure motorcycle because I go on long multi day camping trips and need a way to overcome almost anything that could go wrong.  I bring everything I need to get the bike back on the road or survive a problem without anyone's help except for the people in my group.  Usually, there's just one other person with me, and we can share the load of tools and supplies if we are careful.  I installed a couple 12v lighter adapters directly wired to the battery on my motorcycle for this purpose, and to power just about anything.  This charger is larger than I would like to carry in my motorcycle luggage- the yellow core section is about the size of a flattened softball but rather light.  The cables are plenty hefty but rather heavy.\n\nThis unit would be great for a car.  I gave it to my wife's car and may borrow it for motorcycle trips of I don't find a smaller solution.  Her battery is hidden behind her front bumper so you need a lot of tools and time to jump start directly on the battery.\n\nIn the end, this is a great product for use in specific situations.

Lawler", "reviewText": "I was surprised when I tried this out finding it \"pumps\" power from the \"source\" car into the \"dead\" car.  I assumed that this would let the power thru from the source (which is at a higher voltage) to the dead one & slow/stop the flow of power if the voltages equalized, but it doesn't.  It continues to draw on the source to feed power into the dead one (even if it makes the source drop to under 12V while the dead one gets raised to 13+V which I saw on meters hooked up on both ends).  I also tried hooking this up to a small battery to charge it and it had it at 17V pretty quick, so it doesn't regulate the voltage (over 15V is considered overcharging most batteries, but this is intended for brief use).  Also the first time I tried it, it didn't begin charging (although I had it plugged in) until I started the good car. I'm not sure what held it back initially & triggered the change, but it's instantly started charging when I plugged it in ever since.\n\nOtherwise I think of this as a 5 amp battery charger that plugs into another car instead of your house (it pulls ~8 amps from the good car while putting over ~5 amps into the \"drained\" one).  It will take at least 10 minutes to get enough charge in the cars battery to get you going, so don't expect to instantly crank an engine like \"jump starting\" with old cables.  The \"dead\" battery still must accept that charge and return it to crank the car, if it won't then you will need heavy jumper cables.  The wires on this are at least 14 gauge and ~15 feet long, so it's not cheaply built (I've seen similar units with only 5 foot wires for about the same price or another going for $30).  Also FYI I've heard from mechanics, \"Expect a battery to take as long to recharge as it did to discharge IE: if you drain it fast while cranking an engine it'll recharge pretty fast (from a fast charge source), if you drain it slow from leaving lights on it'll take a long time to recharge\".\n\nAlso remember that to get power thru the lighter socket into the car with the drained battery, you want to have the key switch in \"Accessories\" position in the dead car.  That's because you want the lighter socket to be \"on\" (connected to the battery), but you don't want the cars engine circuits to be on until trying to start it (since they would be draining much of the charge power coming thru if you left the key in the \"on\" position).  Also you do need a certain plug in the \"source\" car (the black plug) and the other in the \"dead\" car (the red plug), so I hope the reason for 1/2 of the \"It doesn't work\" reviews aren't from one of those items not being done correctly.", "summary": "This thing actually \"pumps\" the power", "unixReviewTime": 1195344000}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "18", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 5, 2004", "reviewerID": "AZ6VNFY7KUMXK", "asin": "B00005RHQQ", "reviewerName": "Eric M.

Eckman", "reviewText": "We bought a house with a sump pump and I looked into a battery backup system.  If this is your first time considering a battery backup, you'll quickly see that it is a very overwhelming purchase as its not as simple as it first seems.\n\nIn a nutshell, when considering a battery backup, you have two main options.  A separate battery powered sump that installs as a second pump to your primary.  You mount the battery backup pump slightly above your other one so that if the first pump fails, when the water rises to the second one, it pumps the water out.  The biggest issue with a second pump is that you need to install a second set of PVC pipes and merge it in with your existing pipes.  Installing PVC pipes isn't exactly hard, but it takes some planning and a lot of extra pieces.\n\nThe other option is to stick with a single AC powered pump, but get an external 12v DC battery with a DC to AC inverter (like this one) and use it like you would with a UPS for a computer.  You can't simply use a normal UPS though as they cannot handle the current draw from a sump pump.  You also cant simply use any inverter as it only changes DC from a car battery to AC for your pump, you also need one that will charge the battery and keep it fully charged at all times.\n\nEach option has it's pros and cons.  A battery backup pump requires more up front installation, but costs less.  The con is that you are stuck with a proprietary battery backup system.  When the battery dies, you are tied to a single model.  If that model is discontinued or replacement batteries are hard to find, you might have to replace the whole system each time the battery goes out.  An inverter/charger plus car battery like this is a lot more expensive up front, but the installation is simple, and when the battery needs to be replaced, you can go to any auto parts store and pick up a new battery.\n\nWhen selecting a battery to use, you can't just use any 12v car battery, it must be a deep cycle marine battery.  It doesn't need to be a top of the line gel battery, but it must at least have the words \"deep cycle marine\" on it.  You also need a battery with enough capacity to run your sump pump for an adequate time for it to work long enough for power to be restored in your area.  My target time was 24 hours.  Since every application is different, I don't want to recommend a battery, but instead, head over to Tripp Lite's site and read their article about selecting the correct battery for your application.  They have a handy guide on their website (Amazon does not allow links in reviews) that explains how to calculate what size battery you need.\n\nOnce you have your battery and this Tripp Lite Inverter/Charger, you will also need battery cables and I highly recommend a battery box to keep the battery safe.  Amazon sells a variety of \"invertor\" battery cables, any of them will do.  The setup I used had a red, black, and green cable for ground.  I did not use the ground cable.  Also, some guides recommend a 200 amp fuse to be installed on the red line of your battery.  I chose not to do that, but you might want to do it for extra safety.\n\nThe last thing you want to make sure you have is a sturdy platform to install these on.  Any type of car/marine battery should not rest on a cement basement floor.  At the very minimum, you want to put a piece of plywood on the floor and rest it on that.  If you are putting this on a table of shelf, keep in mind that a marine battery is pretty heavy.  This invertor/charger isn't lightweight either.  I would estimate that it weighs somewhere around 20-25 lbs by itself, so make sure you have something that can hold 50+ lbs safely.\n\nInstallation is a snap.  Reading the instructions, it took me less than 10 minutes to get everything hooked up.  There are a few dip switches on the inverter/charger that you change depending on which battery you got and how often you want it to run.  The inverter/charger can be set to run as an inverter only (in case you have a separate charger), or also charge too.\n\nIn terms of power, Murphy's Law has kicked in since buying this as we haven't had a single power outage, so I cannot comment on how well it lasts without any power, but I did test the system by unplugging it from the wall and waiting for the sump to cycle and it worked properly.  There is a moderately loud fan that kicks on when the inverter/charger is charging the battery, but when its charged, it is completely quiet.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with this product and hope that it lasts for a long time.

Sure there are more expensive units but from what I've read from past users this Tripp-Lite PV1250FC will fit the bill and last for years.\n\nThis inverter worked flawlessly in starting a 13 amp Skil-Saw, a 12 amp vacuum cleaner and a 13 amp microwave oven.  The red overload light would come on for a second or so while the saw, vacuum and microwave ramped up and then it was smooth sailing.  I ran the microwave and vacuum about 5 minutes to my satisfaction.  Since these units were pulling 1500 watts continuous and close to 2500 surge for start up, I feel these results were very admirable for a 1250w rated inverter.\n\nPrimarily though I just wanted an inverter that I could run at 500 watts or usually less for months or years continuously if need be without the worry of it burning up.  It will be primarily used on a solar power battery bank that will drain and charge the batteries in the 200-500 watt range.  I wanted durability and I feel this inverter will provide that.  If it doesn't I will surely report back...\n\nkd", "summary": "Sturdy Build...High Output...Super Quality...", "unixReviewTime": 1415232000}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "2", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 1, 2014", "reviewerID": "A12EJZ3EDYZP3Z", "asin": "B00006HNRY", "style": {"Size:": " 3000W", "Style:": " Compact"}, "reviewerName": "Dustin Warren", "reviewText": "This is the Optimus Prime of power inverters.

I forgot the time period restriction for the registration but you have to include an original receipt for the purchase - no copies. You can question the manufacturer - Winners International.

It is of very good quality and will get every dust particle off your newly washed and waxed vehicle without marring the finish. The only concern I have was that I  did not realize just how heavy this Duster was when I was using it for extended periods of time. This is the reason I rated it a 4 star instead of a 5 star, that, and the fact I could not give it a 4 1/2 star.  It does cover a lot of surface in a short time because of its size. The mop head itself is 13\" long and and when you add the handle to it, it makes the whole Duster 24\" long. It does come with a nice plastic bag to store the Duster in when not in use. .As far as I am concerned this Duster is the best I have found anywhere.\nYes, I would recommend this California Duster to anyone.

This duster keeps a relatively clean, maintained car looking show room shiny and takes only minutes to use. How many things out there can give you a spiffy shine in a couple of minutes?\n\nThe key to using the Duster is to follow the clear instructions provided. You MUST let it dry out a day or two before initial use. It has a waxy coating on the fibers (all the more reason it DOES NOT scratch the finish) and it has to dry out before initial use. Have read a couple of reviews that claim the Duster scratches, but suspect it is because they didn't let it dry out. The one time I forgot to do that, it looked liked it scratched (scared the daylights out of me!), but it was just swirls on the surface from the moist wax - easily removed. And, if there is moisture on the car's surface, it too will look like a swirl or scratch until it dries.\n\nSecond, it is is a DUSTER, NOT a scrub brush. Only to be used on finishes that are otherwise clean but have dust/pollen on them. If you scrub with it to remove mud, splotches, bird droppings, etc., it WILL scratch, just as dry rubbing a car's finish with ANYTHING will scratch it. You let the Duster do the work, lifting the dust right off the car. Doesn't just push it around, but actually lifts it off.\n\nMaker claims it only gets better with time and dirt, but of course can't figure out how that could be true. BUT, have never noticed any problem with use and dirt accumulation. Tried washing once, which maker says you can do, but seems to remove the waxy coating and defeats the effectiveness.

Our cars live in their garage, so before heading out all we have to do is dust off and leave!\n\nIf you are looking for an alternative to waxing (or painting!) your vehicle, this is not its intended purpose.

He just dusts it every morning before he backs out of his garage, and if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer and a microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it. It takes a total of less than 2 minutes to dust off an entire car, yet the result makes your car look like you just washed it.\n\nI use the California Duster before putting on my car cover so that there is no dust between the car and car cover. If you have a garage, it's quite useful since dust settles on the car during the day when you are out and about and at night, even garaged. You won't have to wash your car as often if you use the California Duster. And dust won't build up if you use it often enough. Before discovering the California Duster, I found that after washing my car, I could only use my car cover for a few days before the car got too dusty to put a cover over. Now I find that I can keep the car dust free and use the car cover for much longer, which in turn means I don't have to wash the car nearly as often.\n\nI got the plastic handle California Duster which was significantly cheaper at the time I ordered. Although the wood handle one looks classier and probably feels nicer, the plastic handle one feels plenty sturdy, for the value oriented, get the plastic handle one since it's the exact same brush anyway!\n\nI am really very happy with what I paid for the Calfornia Duster and would not hesitate to recommend one to anyone with a car or motorcycle. Just be aware what it is not made for a car that is wet or very dirty. My only complaint is that it is not actually made in Calfornia.", "summary": "Great!

I had gotten away from super-anal car care the last few years but with a recent purchase of a brand new 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek, my Automotive wishlist her on Amazon has been growing and another California Duster has been towards the top of the \"Really Want\" list.\n\nI still have my old Original California Duster and it works great (like fine wine, it got better with age) but was mostly interested in this smaller one for the interior.  I have a dark grey/charcoal colored interior that is patterned and almost feels 'sticky' to the touch for lack of a water word.  Using a microfiber cloth didn't really clean up the dust too well and another duster I picked up here works ok on the radio console and steering wheel but not on the dash itself.\n\nDespite a few negative reviews here I decided to give it a go after a recent price drop.  Picked this up for $4.63 when I figured I didn't have much to lose.\n\nPut it out on the porch for two days on a stack of newspapers as was suggested.  After that I gave it a bunch of really good shakes and then ran my fingers thru the fibers a few times trying to get out any of the lose ones.  That seemed to do the trick because I haven't had any issues with stray red fibers all over the place or the pad falling apart as I've read in previous reviews.\n\nShortly after I went out to the car and cleaned the outside and the inside.  Shook it out a bunch and it seemed to work great on the dash which has been a PITA since I bought the car.  Afterwards I brought it inside and used it to dust my entire first floor of my house.  This included behind my tv and entertainment center, on top of my refrigerator and all those other places normally buried in dust.  Worked like a charm, sucked it all up and didn't let go.\n\nSo I'd have to say this, just like it big brother, the Original, works like a charm.

The other reviewers that recommended plugging in to pre-cool it are definitely right!  My mistake was in not getting a wall adapter when I ordered the cooler.  One reviewer said it came with one, so I didn't worry about it.  However, now I see there are some questions about that and answers show it doesn't- just the car power cord.  The day before departure, I went all over town trying to find one. (WM, Target, K-Mart, Menards, Cabelas, truck stop)  I was happy to find one at a truck stop along the interstate.  Unfortunately, that didn't work and I didn't find out until I got to the hotel late that night.\n\nThis fit perfectly in the cargo are of a Kia Sportage under the privacy cover while plugged in to charge.  It also fits great on the floor of the back seat in a Nissan Altima and the power cord fit around the right side of the passenger seat to charge in the front connection.  The front passenger seat was one notch from the farthest back, but still plenty of room for the passenger as long as they don't plan to lean all the way back.  Neither of those charging ports provide power when the car isn't on, so I wasn't concerned about the battery being drained when not in use.  However, it could be for others, so I'd suggest checking that in advance.  (unless you're in no hurry and have AAA, lol)\n\nI was surprised to find it very light weight and easy to carry with the handle.  The cord doesn't fit well on the prongs on the back that it's supposed to wrap around.  However, that's a non-issue for me.  Overall, I'd recommend this for anyone who travels.  It may seem pricy, but the price saved on bringing your own drinks/snacks and the convenience are worth it if you are on the road a lot.

Today I pulled it out and found that it STOPPED WORKING!! It would heat up but the cooling fan did not turn. Boy was I furious, as we have barely used this only a couple of times. I started looking into the warranty, and then the engineer/mechanic in me said take it apart and see if it can be repaired. So that's what I did.\n\nUsing a #2 square bit, took the two screws out of the bottom and popped off the rear cover. Easily found the problem once the rear cover was removed. The power connector to the cooling fan had been jarred loose. I reconnected the connector, wrapped it in a little electrical tape so it woudnt come lose again, and now the cooler works like new again.\n\nSo in conclusion, my cooler needed a very minor repair. It's a 5 star product, but I will give it 4 stars for the hassle of fixing it.

Koolatron may have gotten some bad fans - a lot of people complain about noise - this one is infinitely quieter than the smaller cooler. This cooler would benefit from a gasket for the lid (which I'll probably add). The only thing that is slightly off is the interior fan shroud - it does not fit well, and I'm not sure if I can straighten it or not. There is a bit of a gap all down the right side - which means that some of the air is not moving across the cold plate. I think our friends to the north could do a bit better. Other than that, this cooler is great. Plenty of room, and cooled down to 40 degrees in about 40 minutes - in the car. I'm going to try an inverter and 120 volt adapter to see if that's any better or different than the 12 volt plug in.

It's all plastic, and to be honest, the top cover popped off a few times when opening it - nothing that couldn't be fixed in a few seconds, but really, the quality isn't that much different than a cheap conventional cooler. Still, for the price, it's definitely more than adequate to give years of service if you take care of it. Other positives are a long 12V power cord that will reach just about anywhere in your car, and fairly quiet operation that's barely noticeable unless your car is dead quiet and you're sitting right next to the cooler.\n\nI like the overall size and shape - it fits well on the floor behind the front seats where it's easy to reach, even while driving (of course, that depends on your car). Compared to a similar sized non-powered cooler, you get a lot more usable space in this guy because you're not wasting half the capacity on ice or freezer packs...virtually the entire interior can be packed to the brim and it all stays cold. This also makes for a lighter and easier to carry unit.\n\n12-oz cans fit best in this unit. Larger bottles work too, but you'll only get a small number in the Koolatron. If you tend to like bigger items, you might want to look at one of the larger coolers. The good news is that I find that the unit itself is fairly well insulated, so even when you shut the power, it will keep your stuff cold for at least several hours, depending on how hot it gets inside your car.\n\nIt can also be used to keep food items warm - have to admit I didn't try this mode. The cool vs. heat mode is selected by the way you attach the plug - this is an area that could use a little improvement as it's hard to see in the dark.

It did run for up to 4 hours when we were away from the car and the car still started, but we forgot to unplug it one night, and it did totally run down the battery.\n\nAccessories:\n110 volt power supply is great accessory.  We plugged the cooler into the motel room or friends house most nights. We did use the Coleman power supply we already had without problems\nRadio Shack indoor/outdoor thermometer is another great accessory.  We attach the thermometer to the outside of the cooler or car seat with double sided tape and run the wire  and probe to the inside of the cooler. This gives a reading for both car and cooler temperature.\nKoolatron Battery Saver did not work for us. We purchased this accessory after our return home because of the dead battery incident.  Although we already knew the car would still start after 4 hours, this is probably too long.  We wanted to keep the cooler running for stops on the next road trip, but to shut off before the battery got too low.  We tried 2 of these units in 4 different cars, and the greatest time the battery saver would allow the cooler to run was about 4 minutes after shutting off the car engine. We did discuss this issue with Koolatron customer service, but didn't come up with a satisfactory solution.  We did like the fact that Koolatron does have someone to talk to without a long wait, which is rare today.", "summary": "Good Product", "unixReviewTime": 1331251200}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "4", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2012", "reviewerID": "A2W7XZ6R4RYD6F", "asin": "B00009PGNS", "style": {"Color:": " Gray"}, "reviewerName": "Van Trekker", "reviewText": "I recently purchased one of these coolers and am very pleased with how well it worked, as quiet as a whisper.

I did a little research and this model is now discontinued, hence I think the substantial discount on the price. Nonetheless, my vehicle is an older truck (1999 Lincoln Navigator 4x4) and I did not think it would be an issue with having a discontinued model and I was right.\n\nI received my scanner and quickly hooked it up to my truck's computer (service engine soon light was on) and I was able to read 4 error codes.  I was experiencing a very rough idle and I hesitated taking it to the dealer or Midas (more expensive than the dealer) where they wanted $100 bucks to pull the codes and turn light off, crazy stuff I though and I hate having the \"ripped off\" feeling.\n\nI don't consider myself a mechanic, but rather a very occasional Saturday mechanic, but I like to some tinkering with stuff, so I was not too afraid to try and troubleshoot this one on my own (I always learn something when I take this approach).\n\nI must say that having the code and a brief description of the error was a great little feature to have built right in to the unit.  Other scanners don't have the built in description of the error code, but rather a website you can reference the code.  That's is fine, but there is something to be said for instant knowledge, right there and then on the scanner's screen.\n\nI took the codes back to my laptop and did a little more research using the forums that come up when you Google around.  Two codes indicated I had two malfunctioning oxygen sensors and given that my truck as almost 140K miles, it seemed logical.  I went to my local auto parts store and got a couple of downstream O2 sensors, btw I later found them to be about 20% cheaper on amazon.com, but while the problem got better when I replaced them, I still has a rough idle.  The other two codes made reference to a \"lean mixture\" condition and after doing more Google searches I found that I probably had a vacuum leak or a dirty MAF.  I turned out to be a broken vacuum hose that runs from the PVC valve to the top of the engine.  I replaced the hose and the car runs like new!  I erase the codes again and I have not sent the service engine soon light come on yet.\n\nKeep in mind that the scanner will likely not give you the fix, but rather in most cases point you in the right direction, you will have to research a little to resolve the issue.  Nonetheless, I could not have solved the problem without it.  Spend the money and get the tool, you will feel empowered and not so helpless when you see the service engine soon light.  The scanner's screen display menus will help you along, they are very helpful and you will likely not need to even read the manual.  It's very intuitive and no batteries required,it will get its power from the cord once you hook it up to the car's computer.\n\nGood luck.\n\nLegFlex\nSeattle, WA", "summary": "Great tool!

I thought it might be a bad tank of fuel or a loose fuel cap.  The light would remain lit at slow speeds, and at highway speeds it would flash.  The problem persisted after a tank of highest quality fuel was consumed with a tight fuel cap.  I purchased an Actron AutoScanner from Amazon.com.  The scanner informed me that cylinder one was misfiring.  I knew the original spark plugs should be replaced.  Each cylinder has its own ignition coil.  The ignition coils need to be removed to install the plugs below.  Each coil is attached by only one bolt.  While removing all of the coils I marked the cylinder one coil.  I replaced all of the ordinary worn plugs with premium Bosch Platinum + 4 plugs.  I installed the coil from cylinder one on cylinder two and the other coils I installed randomly on the other five cylinders.  I started the engine and it did run better due to the new plugs.  The engine still ran rough however and the check engine light did remain lit.  The Actron AutoScanner then informed me that cylinder two was now misfiring.  Bingo!  I purchased a new ignition coil from Federated/Ficher Auto Parts for $60.  The GM dealer price fore the same part was $130.  I bolted on the new coil and my troubles were over.  The Actron AutoScanner performed excellently.  The scanner protected my small bank account from the dealership service department.  The scanner minimized the time I spent diagnosing the issue.  I stored it carefully away for the next time.\n\n*  *  *  PRODUCT UPDATE MAY 2014  *  *  *\nI have since used Actron CP9135 autoscanner to diagnose issues on several makes and models of vehicles.  It has never failed to steer me to failed component.  In recent years scanner has been helpful with a 2002 VW Jetta Station Wagon vehicle with two liter gasoline engine.  Autoscanner told me when the catalytic converter was failing and needed replacement.  I think scanner may have helped with real savings though when a VW 4 speed 01M automatic transmission problem occurred.\n\nThe VW went into so-called limp mode unexpectedly, check engine light illuminated and stayed lit.  The car would operate in lower gears in a strange fashion and did not want to shift into fourth gear.  At the time I was driving home with fifty miles to go on a rural highway that alternated between two and four lanes.  I had autoscanner handy and from what it told me I decided driving the car in limp mode would not cause further damage.  I just had a long way to limp but I cruised along in third gear at 4000 RPMs while other cars and long haul tractor trailers passed by angrily when they could.\n\nVW automatic transmissions use a number of electronic sensors to monitor the automatic transmission environment.  The code that Actron CP9135 autoscanner provided meant G38 transmission speed sensor had failed.  I purchased G38 sensor online for approximately $30 and installed myself.  Problem seemed immediately solved.  I have put fifteen thousand miles on transmission since.  Problem was indeed solved.  There is no doubt in my mind dealership mechanics or even certain real mechanics have more than once taken $1000 or more from frightened low information customers facing the same issue.\n\nAll this to say I saved a bunch of money on car repairs by having and using an Actron CP9135 autoscanner I purchased six years ago.", "summary": "ACTRON CP9135 AUTOSCANNER DIAGNOSTIC CODE SCANNER", "unixReviewTime": 1189296000}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "8", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2007", "reviewerID": "A1JLXIYHGE8Y7K", "asin": "B00009RAX7", "reviewerName": "Hank", "reviewText": "This is a great product, it does exactly what it's supposed to do, at a reasonable price, with an easy interface.

At 67 years old now, I've owned numerous chargers and I have even sold small chargers at my marina store. Nothing beats this to the best of my knowledge. It is true the clamps could be improved but I want to examine the clamp complaints I read here more closely.\n  I did have one of my clamps break after using the charger successfully for a couple years. One clamp broke exactly in the same place described in other comments I read here. Mine broke after about three years of use but, in all honesty, it was my fault. I let the hood down on the clamp while it was attached to my battery and the clamp broke. Maybe a metal clamp would have held up to this abuse but I doubt I would have liked the burn mark in my hood... maybe right through, or possibly badly marking the light blue paint  from heat?\n  I ran across this internet spot while searching for the company to order parts. The guys who gave this charger a bad rating and complained because the company won't send replacement clamps are all wet. Those clamps are riveted on to the wire and the wire is doubled and riveted to both sides of heavy copper clamp jaws so is not really practical or safe for the company to allow a user to try replacing these clamps at home. Now, if they would supply a replacement clamp which could be attached by bugging on to the wire with a screw, then maybe that would work. unfortunately, that is not in the cards so sending it back is the right approach.\n  However, before I reached that conclusion, I tried to replace my broken clamp and I've noticed something else to be taken into consideration here. I actually did purchase a set of replacement clamps at Auto-Zone but upon closer inspection, I would not use those. The plastic clamps on my charger really seem far superior to the metal clamps I bought because the plastic clamps have heavier teeth and the wire is attached to both sided of the copper clamp jaws. The wire can only be attached to one side of the clamp jaws on the replacement clamps I got at Auto Zone and I don't think those cheap clamps with wiring to only one side of the jaw will stand up to the 100 AMP starting mode on my charger either. By the way, that starting feature works great as well. SO, be happy with your new charger but treat it kindly with care ... it will do its job if you do your job right when using this tool, it will do its job right for you.\n  AH-HA, I found a great set of replacement clamps at a great price. I purchased the code #14-600 Goodall booster cable clamp set from Century Tool and Equipment in St. Peters, MO [phone 877-977-TOOL] [...] at the reasonable price of $12.08+$6.45 S&H. Let me tell you, these puppies will never break and they have a copper strap built in so both sided of the clamp will conduct power to your battery. These are 600 amp clamps and they come with a lug and screw to attach your cable. The lug looks pretty heave for the wire size on the charger so I might reuse the existing lug if I can drill out the rivit... nevertheless, the fix only cost me $$18.53 for both clamps and from the looks of these things I'll never have the broken clamp problem again. Good luck! BTW, I would have written a whole new review about replacing the clamps but The AMAZON system would only allow me to ammend my existing review. It's still a great charger and I wouldn't want to change my opinion in that regard anyway.\n\n  Harveys Lake, PA.", "summary": "Finest Charger - plastic clamps OK, FOUND BETTER CLAMPS", "unixReviewTime": 1300492800}, {"overall": 3.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2009", "reviewerID": "A219MBMWDF8JVK", "asin": "B00009RB0T", "reviewerName": "Believer of Liberty", "reviewText": "<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Vector-VEC1093-Smart-Battery-Charger-2-10-20-40-100-Amp/dp/B00009RB0T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Vector VEC1093 Smart Battery Charger (2/10/20/40/100 Amp)</a>\n\nI have had this unit for about six months.

I recommend anyone interested in buying one of these to visit the manufactures website and view the installation video and vehicle specific info prior. This is not an installation for everyone, and the video will allow you to decide if you want to tackle this yourself or have a professional install it for you.\nAs a side note I also installed one of these in my wife's Korean Spec Hyundai Samtamo (built under licence Mitsubishi Expo. It was also easy to install and I had it in and working in about 4 hours also. I found after installing both of them that by doubling the length of wire supplied on the antenna the range of the remote starter in increased substantively.\nAlso..

The engine can't be started unless the car detects a radio frequency signal from the key fob.\n\nThis arrangement makes stealing a car much harder for younger, less experienced, \"grab and go\" car thieves.

The \"bypass module\" can be a separate unit or it can be integral, as it is with this RS1100.  The car can then be started remotely because the car detects the RFI signal from the spare key.\n\nThis also means that you have permanently stored a spare key inside your vehicle in a place where every car thief will know to look.

I was able to install the starter portion within about 3.5 hours on a Dodge Stratus '98 with no special security bypass requirements.

The reason I'm having trouble with the parking lights is because the unit that I received does not have a brown wire that I can use for the lights.  The manual references a brown wire that does not exist.  After calling support they stated they had never seen this and I would have to call Customer Service to get another wire harness to fix this.  This is just the first of many questions that the technical support person should have been able to answer.\n\nFor example I asked him if the wires went in order according to the order they are listing in the manual so I could figure which one should be the brown wire.  He stated that they are not, but if fact after double checking they are in order.  It appears that my unit has 2 black ground wires.  Now it's up to me to figure out which one should be the brown light wire.  I also asked about which guide I should reference for the resistors used for the door locks and the answer he gave me was way off base and I would have to be an idiot to not follow the special notes on the wiring diagram which spells out the special resistors for the door locks.\nHope this helps your decision process!\n-Ben", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2009", "summary": "Great Product Not so Great Support", "unixReviewTime": 1234310400}, {"reviewerID": "A3GDY0HG57VGC3", "asin": "B00009WC2S", "reviewerName": "Jeffrey D.

The biggest problems with any of these self-installed units (this brand or others) are (1) people who don't have any electrical experience or tools, and (2) installation on cars that have difficult to access wiring (most). The latter can make the difference between a relatively easy or relatively hard installation. The kit electronics appear good for this type of item. All parts (and a small installation tool kit) are included - - except for any small relays that may be necessary for some door locks, security bypasses, and some dome light activiation situations. They are not needed on every vehicle, but many. A couple should be included since they are cheap and these Remote Starters are not. Also, if under-dash wiring is a bit hard to get at (or not), they have plug-in T-harnesses available that range in cost between $10 and $20. Using one would eliminate almost all hookup problems. I didn't use one. My unit works great. I don't anticipate problems, but I have experience in tapping into wiring properly so the connections should last.

Then look at the recommended crossbar spacing for your vehicle in the Yakima Q Clip instruction booklet. If the measurements are not similar (ie. rear wheel not centered over the rear crossbar, short roofline and long wheelbase bike), then the rear wheel will hang far behind the rear crossbar and there's a good chance that the rear towers will shift forward when transporting your bike. This can result in roof damage from the shifting clips and the bike's rear wheel contacting and scratching the roof.\n\nThe Boa is Yakima's most economical rooftop bike mount and it shows. If you live in a low crime neighborhood and remove your bike and rack when you are away from your car, this mount will probably work just fine for you. Or if you absolutely need to minimize the footprint of the rack when it's off your vehicle.\n\nThe Boa pod is mostly made of glass-filled polymer. There is a flimsy plastic cover that is secured by the skewer and covers the heads of the 3 hex mounting bolts. Unfortunately, even when locked, this cover can easily be pried and cracked open by hand revealing the 3 bolt heads. I complained and Yakima responded that they only provide theft deterrence and cannot guarantee against theft. This does not even approach deterrence.\n\nThe Boa mount comes with Yakima's universal locking skewer with a polymer lever, stainless rod, and round steel nut. If the skewer is closed and locked but the handle is in the wrong orientation and there's insufficient tension, then it's a simple matter to rotate the handle counterclockwise to loosen the nut and steal your bike. The lever and cam are plastic and will deform and wear with use. When no bike is loaded, the only way to secure the mount is to tighten the nut further and then close and lock the skewer. However, adjusting the nut defeats the purpose of providing a long-throw skewer.\n\nAdding a long tray converts the mount into a Copperhead mount. However, given the security concerns, I returned this mount and purchased a Yakima Steelhead mount instead. The Steelhead has a clamshell clamping design and is mostly metal. It comes with a stainless metal skewer that has a special locking pin and e-clip on the nut. When the skewer is locked, the clamshell cannot open and the skewer nut cannot be removed even if it is not tightened and tensioned against the mount body. As with the Boa, make sure that the skewer lever rests against the crossbar when locked so that it can only be turned clockwise tightening (and not loosening) the nut.\n\nIf you don't want to spend much more than the cost of the Boa but want to use your SKS lock cores, consider purchasing a Steelhead body (new or used) and a Rocky Mounts Lariat tray. You will need to drill a hole in the tray to mount the Yakima head. The Rocky Mounts crossbar mount is compatible with Yakima's round bars and comes with all hardware, and their wheel strap is also less expensive than Yakima's.\n\nIf you are using or considering Yakima Q Towers, I have a separate review of that product on Amazon.", "summary": "Poor security, measure bike and vehicle before buying", "unixReviewTime": 1197331200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2015", "reviewerID": "AV2DQXT8WHSWM", "asin": "B0000AT0WE", "style": {"Size:": " 7.5x7.5x2.75", "Color:": " One Color"}, "reviewerName": "JC", "reviewText": "Simple design that does the job.

It worked great the few times I used it for those years. I only had it on the hitch when towing, and I removed it once towing was completed. But then I started towing a lot and left it in place for the last 1.5 years. Recently, I needed to take it off my hitch and found the lock was seized. Nothing worked to unlock it, so I had to cut it off; a long process that I did not have time for since I was in a hurry to get on the road. Once I pulled out the pin, I saw the pin was badly rusted within the receiver. So, in 1.5 years, this lock rusted fast and became useless.\n\nHere is the good:\n1. It is sturdy and seems to be very secure.\n2. The rubber key cover works as advertised and lasts a long time.\n3. Easy to operate.\n4. Out of the way from my chain connections.\n5. Fits my hitch very well. I have seen other reviewers complain about it being too long for class 3 and 4 hitches. I can't figure out why they have a problem with that.

The corrosion problem could lead to structural failure without warning. That could mean losing your trailer on the road.\n4. The lock mechanism can seize up from corrosion. If you end up having to cut this off your hitch, there is possibility of damaging the chrome or paint of your bumper because the cutter can and probably will slip.\n\nBecause of the corrosion problem, I would not buy this again.

I had about a 40 foot wide strip a half mile long to reseed with Bermuda grass. Not allot of acres but more than I could do with a small hand-held spreader and much too rough and sloped for a pull-type. After researching as much as possible, I bit the bullet and bought this one. It mounts quite easily to my Kawasaki 4 wheeler rack (either rear or front) and has a shield to keep grass seed from hitting the driver if front-mounted. It mounts with 2 U-bolts with wing-nuts. Then attaches to it's own mount with 2 small hitch pins. The only tool I needed was an Allen Wrench (1/32 size, by the way!) The 12 volt actually plugs into the power plug. I didn't have to wire it to the battery as I had expected. (Though this could be a problem if you don't HAVE a power plug on your ATV!) My only complaint about this spreader is that it has no graduations or markings to help you set the openings for different seed or fertilizer. It has two large holes in the bottom of the spreader that are opened with a draw-bar. It took quite a bit of experimenting to get it set close to where I thought it should be. There are instructions on how to calculate the opening but since my 4wheeler has no speedometer, I couldn't use their calculations! If you are spreading Bermuda grass, as I was, then halfway open and driving at 1.8 MPH is about right. The seed flowed through the spreader just fine. Over-all I am very happy with my purchase.

I have a Polaris Sprortsman 570  that I installed a rear brush guard on, so mods were necessary for the install since the guard prevents mounting the plate on on the rear rack.  I had a choice of getting larger U bolts for the 2\" brush guard, or drilling...I chose drilling for a more stable, better looking permanent mount for the plate.  I centered the mounting plate on the brush guard using the lowest two holes on the plate, marked and drilled through the brush guard with a 5/16 bit then mounted the plate using two and a half inch grade 8 carriage bolts, nuts, washers and lock washers.  To solve the tipping/leaning issue other reviews commented about when the bin is full of heavy material, I removed the bolts holding the top metal band on the bin and replaced them with 3/8 eye bolts, then used a pair of 6' 400lb-rated ratchet straps hooked through the eye bolts and rear rack to pull tension on the top of the bin (before loading with material) to add extra stability (you can get a pair of them here on Amazon...Keeper 03720 Camouflage...for less than $13).  Trim the strap length for a custom fit then just store them in the bin with the pins used to secure the broadcaster to the mounting plate when off the quad. (By the way, I tried bungee cords first and found that they just did not provide the stability I was looking for, so went with the ratchet straps.)\nI finished my mods by putting a couple of small pieces of Gorilla tape on either side of the slot in the mounting plate where the gate handle goes through then cut a slit in the tape to push the end of the handle through when mounting the bin, so the handle doesn't flop around loose in the slot...kinda anal about stuff rattling on my quad.\n  The instructions on how to determine broadcast rates would have you wasting a lot of material.  We just had someone follow me, starting with the gate closed, then gradually opened it until we felt the width and material spread was right given the speed I wanted to run on my quad and the size of the food plot...slower for the narrower plots and faster for a wider spread on the large plots.  Since I broadcast in two directions to get good ground coverage on the food plots, we keep the initial flow rate at an estimated half of what we want to put on the plot for the initial pass, to ensure that we do get some material on the entire plot before that allotment runs out, then open the gate further on the second pass if we have more than half of the allotted material left to spread...takes a bit longer but we get better coverage in the long run.\n\nUPDATE 10/24/16:  Switch died 15 minutes into broadcasting wheat on the first of 10 food plots on recent work weekend at the camp.  Ohmed out the part and it is the El Cheapo inline switch.  Fortunately I had a spare power cord I was able to use that saved the weekend for our crew, since I was one of only two 4-wheelers and the only one designated to spread seed.  Called Buyers and the first thing I was told that since I didn't buy it directly from Amazon they would not support direct parts replacement and I had to take the part to one of their distributors an hour away to get it replaced.  WRONG ANSWER...long story short Kristin with Buyers did agree to ship another part direct (3002232) so at least I may be able to use the thing again this weekend...THANKS KRISTIN, I appreciate you...good move on the customer satisfaction side...bad initial decision not to directly support Amazon customers since I'll bet Amazon would be happy to discontinue listing your product altogether and sell just Moultrie spreaders...reviews suggest you need to look into QA on the power switch too...", "summary": "Good Unit After Mods But See Update Regarding Buying Via Amazon", "unixReviewTime": 1475452800}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2016", "reviewerID": "AYHF64R8WGQ9Q", "asin": "B0000AWYM3", "reviewerName": "Bill Readshaw", "reviewText": "Got tired of the pull cart spreaders.

The bead breaker worked fine, no problem. Also taking these small tires OFF the rim with the tool was quite easy and fast and the tool worked well.

This allowed it to ride on the edge of the rim and not slide out. The second thing I did was to change the position of the silver locking \"cone\" when I was installing the tires. I removed the cone, installed one of the plastic spaced on threaded rod so it contacted the tire hub first, then placed the installation tool over the plastic spacer. The cone was then placed on top of the spacer and the locking component was then screwed down tight. What this did was trap the installing tool between the tapered cone and the tire. Between that and the groove I cut into the tool, it made the installation a snap. It would have been impossible to mount a 5\" stiff tubeless tire with the tool without the modification to the tool and using in the manner I described.

I did find that securely mounting it to a stable bench or welding table that is about waist high, plus placing a couple of wood slims between mounting base and the bottom side of the tool that fits into the mounting base really helps to make the tool stable and it doesn't move around while un-mounting/re-mounting a tire. You have enough things to do working with changing a tire without having to also do a balancing act with a moving target. Having the tool mounted at waist high provides you with the opportunity to use your upper body strength to an advantage. If you need more leverage on remounting the tire bead place a short piece of pipe as needed with a diameter just big enough to fit over the end of the tire bead mounting tool. Also having a good smooth end tip tire tool would be nice to have as needed. The smooth end is to reduce the chance of cutting the bead &/or inner tube.
