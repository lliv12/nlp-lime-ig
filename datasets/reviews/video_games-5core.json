The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series.\n\nAt first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.  I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal.\n\nMuch like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty.  But that's speeding on loose ground for you.  Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.

But its the restrictive QTE gameplay and final-kill cut-scenes that kill the game for me. I loath enforced QTE. When a mission goes awry and you're trying to escape a hail of bullets, if you happen to brush past an assailant you can't escape QTE mode. Meanwhile you're being shot at from all sides. It just lacks the sense of freedom that Blood Money had, and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a second-rate interactive movie.\n\nAs a loyal fan of the Hitman franchise, I waited years for this. I would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival Saints Row or the GTA series etc. What they did add took away from the game. For instance they should have kept the semi-open-worlds of Blood Money and build-on those beautiful sets, maps and locations.\n\nI would have loved if Hitman had been as open as Skyrim. Overall Dishonored's gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience. But I wish they had had Bioshock Infinite's breathtaking visuals in that particular game.\n\n==================================================================\n\nWow after all these years waiting-- this is it.....?!!!\n\nI am still a huge fan of Blood Money. The fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus! To play, all you have to do is watch a 30-second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level. Who can complain about that? But this, what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of Metal Gear Solid?!\n\nIntuition....? STOP! STOP! STOP Please let me use my own intuition! And what is it with the game constantly talking to you like you're an idiot? All this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere, tension and suspense!\n\nYou want to know how bad this game is....? They use cut scenes for the final kill, thus killing any sense of pay off! And you can't even skip through the intro level! Hello? This was a cult game... So lots of people know how to play it and don't need this hand holding to be mandatory!\n\nThe graphics too are little improvement over Blood Money, and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games. There is less of a non-linear feel about this version also. Now you're not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels, but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor IMHO.\n\nSuch a shame, such a shame.

What did you expect? You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did.\nLength of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game.\nStory - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad.\nOverall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don't confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay.\nCharacter dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn't seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There's no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at.\nHand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, \"Q, W or E\" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn't hard to do hand to hand. It wasn't 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good.\nCons:\nOMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn't bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it.\nGraphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues.\n(Minor Spoiler) Don't read if you can't take hints.\nSheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn't believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals.\n\nProfessional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can't even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons.\nSniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge. It just lets you do the same challenge over and over.\nAll in all, it's a good game discounted at 1/2 price or lower.

Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight, and nobody's looking.  It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security.\n\nCONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.

Lew", "reviewText": "I really enjoyed the Dirt series of racing games.  I actually started with the Colin McRae Rally 3 demo, which came before Dirt.  Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.

Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new.\n\nThis is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing.\n\nPROS:\n-Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects\n-Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive\n-Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling\n-In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins\n-Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea)\n-3D support!\n\nCONS:\n-Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard\n-Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though)\n-Essentially requires some sort of analog input\n-May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racing\n\nOther thoughts:\n-You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy!\n-LEARN THE TRACKS.

No!\nRacing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating.\n\nNow, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire.

Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it.\nI was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap.\nIt is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game.

I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have \" good enough \" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it.

But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games.\n\nMy only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced.

For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it.  Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well.  For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun.  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy.  There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold.  It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors.\n\nBefore I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide.  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart.  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon.  Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases.  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide.\n\nTo begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest.  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there.  The covers all look very similar.  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them.  The covers and the borders are different on each guide.  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD.  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side.\n\nThere are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal.\n\nThere are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides.  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide.  Ever.  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover.  Originally the guide was only in paperback.  This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here.  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it.\n\nThe second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published.  It has been revised and expanded.  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself.  It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages.  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released.  So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set.\n\nThere are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals.  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns.  Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns.  It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result.  Much of the text isn't so cramped.  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier.  It just looks better and more organized overall.  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking.  The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.  Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped.  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location.  Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required.  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases.  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well.  So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes.  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read.\n\nThe set also came with a few bonuses of note.  The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered.  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark.  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal.  It's invaluable.  The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with.  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package.  Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise.\n\nNevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy.  But let's be clear.  If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves.  After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy.  They are a collector's item.  And it is certainly a nice one.", "summary": "A Fantastic Boxset that's Great for Zelda Fans", "unixReviewTime": 1385510400}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "55", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2013", "reviewerID": "A10PPCIFVK9ZT5", "asin": "0804161380", "style": {"Format:": " Hardcover"}, "reviewerName": "Gary Coffman", "reviewText": "I have been looking forward to receiving this set since I learned about and pre-ordered it back in August. I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging.\n\nAs other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape.\n\nThe guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief.\n\nI do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included.\n\nFirst, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set.\n\nSecond, I was disappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration.\n\nThird (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :)\n\nFinally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with this set.

I have seen many ships, sailed with him around the world numerous times. So ships are in my blood. When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid. Well I wish I didn't because I now regret my decision.\n\nThe game is unique in its concept. We never really had a maritime ship simulation that wasn't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships :). This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo, to passenger, to rescues, to towing, to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc. The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations. Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game. But to me thats where all the goodies end.\n\nThe cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game. Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series.\n\nFirst and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary \"Time Compression\" feature. Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun. Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission. With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast. This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me. I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot don't too. Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more. If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers.\n\nSecond is the still dated graphics engine. I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look. I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise. The ships and ocean etc. looks very simplistically rendered from today's standard. The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though.\n\nLast some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion. This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts, hover boats etc. I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats.\n\nAnyways..i wouldn't really recommend anyone spend $40 bucks on this game. Wait until it gets to $19 or so bargain bin.

I like to clean my game equipent regularly, and I always clean even new items before using. This is a great way to test the quality of the item, I cleaned the skin using isopropanal alchohol, no gumming (like you get with lower grade skins)and no color bleed onto the rag, this tells me it is definitly silicone not some rubber stuff.

Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it.

Ever since the Playstation and beyond, companies have put out tons of items that help give new life to an old thing.\n\nThis memory card is no exception to that rule. I have had this memory card for well over a year now and it has not failed me yet. (This is not to imply that it will last forever, you should always make backups just in case) Imagine now being able to save ALL your game saves on 1 memory card instead of having to look for spare room on an existing 8-meg memory card. Being able to hold 16x more than what a normal memory card can is pretty remarkable. Although there have been a few odd moments that make this a bit of a... well... not so much a problem as it's more of an annoyance.\n\n(One example of annoyance you will have to deal with is that certain games will \"READ\" your card first before it will \"WRITE\" to the card to save. This can take as much as 2-3 minutes before it will finally do anything, and that can cause a problem if either you are not a patient person or you suddenly get a power spike to hit while in the middle of a save where it READS before it WRITES.)\n\nOther than that, the card works on just about every game I have played (Numbering 150+ games on my PS2)\n\nOverall, all I can say is I have not had that much of a problem with it and it has kept working for well over 1 year now. Of course, like any electronic device, experiences will vary from person to person.

One major concern I did have when I bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther. This concern was unwarranted, as I have noticed no difference in response time either way. On durability, I've had these for almost 2 years and they haven't shown any noticeable signs of wear.

There's also a bit more value once you unlock the secret characters, though it's frustrating that there's no save function that keeps these character unlocked.\n\nCertainly not worth full retail price, but the N64 is dead now so you should be able to snag this game for dirt cheap.

By simply  making the adventure more intresting, more long, and with more  \"spookiness\" -- an original Myst-cliche that adds drama to the  game.\n\"Riven\" is even more rewarding than \"Myst\" so  much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless. There's five CDs to the  game -- that's clearly enough for anyone to buy this game. Even as it  starts out, you better look for clues. The developers made it so that if  you do not look for enough information, you could go from one disc to  another in less than 20 minutes.\nThe graphics, while nice, aren't the  best in the world.

It was when I first got my PS and I wasn't disappointed.\nThe graphics were pretty crisp and clear and it had a nice little selection of playable characters including Spiderman, Iron Man, The Hulk, Psylocke, Wolverine and others.  For those who played Marvel vs. Capcom 2 before this one, the movement may feel a little slow to you.  However, this was the first of the Marvel vs. Capcom style games so don't expect it to be as good as MVC2.\nThe default controls for this game are the easiest to work with of any of the Marvel titles.  You'll find it easy to learn and it fits the PS controller perfectly.  Air combos can be pulled off easily but it may take a while for some to learn how to do them.\nOn this game you'll find that the characters hyper combos are much more powerful than they are on MVC2.  However, since this was the first of these type of fighter games, the characters have less moves to execute.  The thing that really separates this game from all of the others is the Gems.  There are 6 Gems that you may use during battle and different ones have different effects on certain characters.  For example when Juggernaut uses the space gem, he turns silver and gains super armor.  When Psylocke uses the Power gems she creates 3 copies of herself so then it's like fighting 3 of them at once.  The final boss on this game is Thanos.  He's better than the boss on the other Marvel titles because he's actually a challenge.  He automatically starts the match with all 6 gems and he also has 6 different hyper combos he can do with each gem.  Also this game actually has endings for the characters and the music is superior to all of the other titles except for Marvel vs. Street Fighter.\nI recommend you buy this game if you can find it for a reasonable price.

Music plays just like you would hear it in the arcade!\n\nGraphics: Great considering the Ram limitations of the PSX(like that was a problem for this game in the 1st place), and they were done with POLYGONS, yes, POLYGONS!\n\nCharacters: You get a line up of the following characters:\n1. Spider-Man (My favorite! \"Maximum Spider!\")\n\n2. Captain America (\"Justice Will Prevail\")\n\n3. The Incredible Hulk (What's to say, he's a \"Monster\" hahahahahaha...sorry.)\n\n4.

However this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there. In fact it has a lot in common with zelda: ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a Megaman game. Coming from the NES and SNES Megamans I never thought I would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well. Its not the greatest  game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own way.\n\nMost people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well. The only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most 3d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most 1998 and before graphics. Kinda a 3d playable anime style to it. The sound isn't to bad in this game. Voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andThe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good. However there is moments without any music. Technically speaking I would say the game has aged well.\n\nThe thing I find most memorable about this game is the gameplay. Like I mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements. There is a open world which was decent in size for its time, which the game takes place in a small town. There are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment. Speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs (attack, fire rate, etc) in a rpg like menu. With that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game. There is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms. The bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeons.\n\nAs for the story it isn't to bad. It is a little childish but its still pretty good. The characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable. Tron Bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs. capcom 2 and appearing without megaman in the 3rd. There is also a N64 port of this game which isn't as good but if you don't have a psx its still playable plus a sequel.

This game was nothing like that game or any other Megaman games. It was in 3-D and had a story that would blow your mind. I have played through this game around 50 times and no every single part of it by heart.\n\nGraphics- 7/10\nThe transition to 3-D for Megaman isn't an ugly one, but a decent one. Most of the trees have a 2-D look to them and a lot of characters are blocky. Still, you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all. Not to mention, there is hardly any load time to wait through in this game.\n\nStory- 10/10\nYou are Megaman Volnutt. Roll Casket and her Grandpa, Barrel Casket, have raised you since they found you when you were a child. Following Barrel's footsteps, Megaman and Roll become Diggers. Diggers are people who search through ruins, infested with Reaverbots, to find parts and other things. The main thing a lot of Diggers are looking for are Refractors, which are extremely powerful crystal-like objects that power society. The world is almost entirely ocean so people must use flying machines or boats to get around. Megaman, Roll, and Barrel crash-land their flying ship, The Flutter, on an island called Kattelox. You go on to discover the island's many secrets and fight off the treasure hungry pirates.\n\nSound- 7/10\nThe music and sound effects in this game are decent. Nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death. Some tunes even become catchy, like the Apple Market tune.\n\nGameplay- 10/10\nYou play as Megaman: exploring ruins, fighting pirates, and just helping people out. There are a lot of side quests you can do. You can join a secret gang, fill a museum with underground arts, help a little girl recover, play in game shows, and so much more. The main storyline has you exploring the Sub-Gate ruins in hopes to learn more about the Island's great treasure, or disaster. While in Sub-Gates you can find all kinds of items to do things with. It's not just in the Sub-Gates either; you can search in other digging sites for parts. You have a primary weapon called a Buster Gun, which can be upgraded with 2 buster parts initially. These buster parts can be bought or found and change different aspects of your Buster Gun's shooting. You have a secondary special weapon that can be equipped and upgraded as well. You will get many different special weapons in the game and one of the most fun parts of the game is upgraded your weapons to perfect ability.\n\nDifficulty- 4/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)\nSince this game is more story based, the difficulty is slight. There is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die, minus a few bosses. Once you beat the original game, you can go back and play it on a new Hard Mode option. The game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble. Also, to top it off, the game isn't that long. Even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then 15 hours. That includes the main storyline and all side quests, minus special weapon upgrading. I can now beat the game on Hard Mode in around 5 hours.\n\nOverall- 10/10\nDespite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound, it's still 5 stars. The game's storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest doesn't even matter. You'll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over again.", "summary": "My Favorite Game or All Time", "unixReviewTime": 1209859200}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "08 11, 2007", "reviewerID": "A2GW1DBM406VU1", "asin": "B000006OVJ", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Jarrett P.

So in 1997 Capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old Mega Man games and bring Mega Man to an ENTIRE new 3D world.  I finally got to experience the 3D Mega Man adventure a few days ago, in July 2006.  So it took me NINE years to finally play it!  What can I say?  I'm slow!\n\nI have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall, I'm happy to report that the jump to 3D was a good one (not to mention a NECESSARY one!)  Mega Man spends the entire time in Legends jumping and shooting through a unique 3D environment.\n\nI'm surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game.  They're quite wonderful if you ask me.  Sure, the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly 10 years old (and walking around in Mega Man Legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos) but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of FUN a game provides.  Mega Man Legends provides a LOT of fun.\n\nI really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where I had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue, red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me.  The first time I completed this battle it took a good 30 minutes ONLY for a bigger, badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds.  At first I was angry because the game wouldn't let me SAVE before fighting this fourth boss.  \"A half hour of work flushed down the toilet\" was the thought that went through my head.\n\nThat led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle, but it turned out I just didn't have the right upgrades for my X-buster equipped (actually I didn't have ANYTHING equipped!) so when I went back to do the battle again I defeated him (her, actually) rather easily.\n\nMost of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat (including the boss fights).  Many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes, though.  The strategy to defeating many of them is to KEEP RUNNING and only turn around when the moment is right and BLAST them!  The only boss who isn't easy is the very last boss (who sounds like Michael Jackson) because he has TWO forms.  The first form you can figure out with practice, but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and THEN the challenge increases.  But it's possible to find enough money to carry up to 10 Sub-tanks to help you out DRASTICALLY.  If you were to carry 10 Sub-tanks he would be a VERY easy boss!  Despite that, the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a LOT of things.  You have to go HERE, you have to go THERE!  You have to collect THIS, you have to collect THAT!  You'll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the Start button and see everything in your inventory.  It's borderline INSANE.\n\nYou see, to help make the game easier, what you have to do is go around searching for things (things located in treasure chests or holes in walls) and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend (or sister, I forget who she is) will be inside.  She can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use.  She must be smart!\n\nI think I explained myself correctly, there.  It's kind of confusing because there's so many things you have to collect and that's the main reason I can't give the game a perfect 5-star rating.  TOO MUCH!  In Mega Man Legends you will find SO many weapons and SO many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone (like me) who's normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game.\n\nYou have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game.  When you're lost, he can also help you by telling you where to go, unfortunately many times he doesn't provide enough information.  So you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you out.\n\nThe music in the game is nice.  It's usually played quietly which is odd because most Mega Man music is RIGHT in your face.  If you can actually hear the music, it's pretty much what you'd expect from a Mega Man game.\n\nListen to those sound effects!!  Sound familiar?  Think South Park!  One of the children (or \"pirates\") sounds JUST like Butters, and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like Kyle's mom!  Some of the animation looks like South Park, too.  When did South Park come out?  1997?  Hmmm, makes you wonder...\n\nOnce again, the graphics.  They aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.  Sort of blocky, of course (since this IS Playstation ONE we're talking about here) but I can't bring myself to really hate the graphics because there's a certain mysterious charm about them.  Mega Man Legends LOOKS like a children's game but it's not, really.  Most children wouldn't be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a child.\n\nThe play control... goodness.  It's definitely not easy to figure out at first.  To make Mega Man walk straight, you have to hold down the L and R buttons (this rotates the direction Mega Man is facing) while at the same time you have to use the up, down, left and right buttons to make Mega Man walk forward.  So, because you have to do a lot of running in Mega Man Legends, when an enemy is chasing you and RIGHT behind you, you have to turn around, use the L and R buttons to face him, and THEN hit him.  In the middle of hitting the L and R buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits.  It may take a few hours to properly pull off but you *should* become better at it with practice.\n\nA trick to help you: when an enemy is chasing you, run as far away from him as possible and THEN turn around.  Usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control Mega Man so he's facing the enemy directly.  Then, simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away!  I wouldn't blame you if you couldn't figure out the controls- it's not the greatest way to control a character.  I'm not sure if Capcom improved the play control in Mega Man Legends 2.\n\nI find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall, many times a *very* small amount of money will be located there.  Small enough to not be able to afford ANYTHING.  It's funny because Capcom made it like \"wow, you found money!\" only to insult you with sofa cushion money.  To find a LOT of money you have to run around shooting enemies.\n\nJust running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny (money) is a lot of fun, not to mention addicting.  A pretty good game worth picking up.", "summary": "Mega Man in 3D", "unixReviewTime": 1153094400}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "12", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2005", "reviewerID": "AMZCQIDUWDHLC", "asin": "B000006OVJ", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "John. N", "reviewText": "To me, Mega Man Legends is one of those games you'll remember years after playing it. The game itself doesn't break any new ground and has its share of flaws, but the overall experience is definitely rewarding.\n\nMega Man Legends pretty much plays like the earlier Tomb Raider games control wise. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the control scheme, such as a lock on system that doesn't allow you to move while locked on an enemy (which was fixed in MML2), and the fact you also must contend with moving the camera manually in order to compensate for the lack of a better lock on system to hit your mark.\n\nLegends also uses a pretty similar graphic engine as Tomb Raider as well, complete with all the flat, 2D scenery that rotates with the camera and all the pixilated surfaces and clipping problems that accompanied that era of Playstation gaming. Unlike Tomb Raider, the environments in Mega Man Legends are much brighter and colorful, adding to the games cartoon-like feel, rather than the dark, dank death-trap ridden tombs that Lara Croft raids.\n\nThe pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well. Considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience, this isn't an error so to speak, but older, more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours (especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing). Thankfully, Capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge (oh and is it ever a challenge). Add to this Capcom increased the difficulty on Mega Man Legends 2 a few notches, and all can be forgiven here.\n\nSo with all these problems, why is Legends such a good game? Heart, and lots of it. Mix in a good story, a wonderful cast of characters (and enemies), and throw in some of Capcom's more respectable forays in voice acting department, and you got a winner. While some may claim that Legends carries a \"kiddy tone\", I actually find this to be one of the game's charms and strengths. Honestly, if you don't laugh when one of the Lego Men, err, I mean Servebots messes up and angers Tron, there is something wrong. Seriously, it isn't anymore kiddy than a Mario or Zelda game (or most of Nintendo's gaming library for that matter).\n\nThe other thing that makes the Legends series so great is the fact Capcom decided to quit while they were ahead. While I myself still wish they would churn out a Mega Man Legends 3 (considering some of the unresolved issues in Mega Man Legends 2's ending), at least Capcom didn't make a zillion sequels and drain the series of all it's fun and respectability, of which they have done a fine job of doing to the original series and X series.\n\nIn the end, Mega Man Legends is not a game you'll remember for amazing graphics, razor-sharp control, or challenging quests.

Graphics, even low-res graphics, can and should be BEAUTIFUL. And beautiful this game is in all its Playstation polygon glory. The lighting, the jets, the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky, it's all just beautiful (to me at least).

And you can bank and pitch completely upside down, something that many similar arcade-style games of the time don't allow. The game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more. There's also voice chatter as you go, some nice arcade style music, and full voice command briefings (nice). Of course you also hear \"Bingo!\" every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too, but that's just keeping with the arcade feel. The enemy A.I. might not be as good as you can get now, but it's definitely good for when this game came out, and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and don't watch yourself.\n\nIn my opinion this game was the first great console air combat game.

It was par for the course.\n\nNow, in 2012, a whole 17 years later (really? that long ago...), a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay, sound, and playability. Sound effects are lo-fi, almost like comparing a cassette to a CD. The soundtrack is still amazing though, as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format. Playability, there is one overall mode - the 1P Arcade mode (unless you count options and 2P). Every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose - the same one you fight in round 8. After that, you have all of the characters and there's not much else to do. There's no team battle, no survival, just...1P Arcade. So it works for 1995. The ending movies are pretty bad, all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly CGI. Of course in retrospect, this WAS 1995.\n\nThe movies never got better in the series until much later, but they did improve some.\n\nOverall, Tekken deserves a place in your PSX collection, right next to 2 and 3. You won't play it often because Tekken 2 covers all of those bases and more.

Xenogears was a monster game that had a fantastic, yet confusing plot that really made you think. Breath of Fire 3 is a complete change of pace. Instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like FF7 and Xenogears, Breath of Fire 3 continues a simple, but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like Xenogears.\nBreath of Fire 3 doesn't have an overly confusing story. Once long ago, there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan. After gaining enough power to destroy the world, the dragon clan suddenly disappeared. You play as Ryu, a young boy who suffers from amnesia. He soon befriends two thieves named Rei and Teepo. After he gets into trouble with the authorities, he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan. So he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past.\nSound original? Sorry, but if it's originality that you want, you won't find it here. Even the battle system is painfully unoriginal. As you play it, it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it. The story, the battle system, everything feels like it was used many times before, and i hate to say this, but the ending is very disappointing.\nHowever, with all gripes aside, Breath of Fire 3 is a fun and engaging quest. My favorite part of the game was the characters; they are interesting, and very funny. I also liked that the plot never once got confusing. Even though it was unoriginal, it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seat.\nWith all the complaints aside, Breath of Fire 3 is fun game to play through.

The battle engine has few innovations, the graphics are standard 2D cutesy sprites on  a rather featureless 3D background, and the plot is riddled with  problems.\nSure, in combat you can turn into eleven different kinds of  dragons, but so what!  At no point in the game are you actually required to  do so. In fact, you can go through the game with no need of a sinle  transformation. Experimenting with different dragon genes (necessary to  discover the above-mentioned dragon types) is tedious and wastes your MP.  In fact, transforming into a dragon wastes so much of your magic, that it  sort of invalidates any strategy.\nThe random battles are copious,  considering the fact that for most of the game you fight with no purpose in  mind. Thankfully, most enemies have a trick or two up their sleeve that you  can learn and perform yourself (most of the ones you can learn are  useless). Combat in this game just isn't fun, probably because it has  nothing to do with the plot.\nThe plot is surprisingly bare and devoid of  livelihood. Just as an example, before you meet the final boss at the end  of the game, you will have no idea that she is there. Neither will you know  for sure why exactly you are fighting her.\nThe plot has a lot of  interesting parts that are left unexplained. Some of the human interactions  seem realistic, but all of the realism is drained away by the fifth time  you are beaten up and kidnapped by the same pair of bandits.\nThe  soundtrack features several off-beat tunes, but otherwise is bleak. You'll  spend most of your game-time listening to no more than five tunes.\nThere  are also a few small things that are sure to irritate. Specific characters  are necessary to perform certain tasks (only the walking onion character  can break the glass seal on an emergency door), but switching characters in  your party is a long and tedious task. Sometimes it takes several seconds  to quit certain conversations, and sometimes there is lag between character  actions in combat.\nI've never played the other installments in the Breath  of Fire series, so I cannot be sure of their quality.

Breath of Fire One seems to be what most people I talk to about games  consider the best. Even though I loved Breath of Fire 2 the most. I  expected a lot from breath of fire 3. Perhaps this helped lower my opinion  of Breath of fire 3, but I did not like this game.\nAs far as game play  goes like all BoF games in BoF 3 you have the ability to turn into a  dragon. Like BoF 1 and unlike BoF2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one  for a while. While you're a dragon you loose MP every turn to keep you from  staying one forever in that combat unlike BoF 1. All the character seem to  get their own special power. The character list is short and one of the  characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character.  The training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind  of pointless weird and honestly I didn't like it. The town to town walking  is slow and you never get fast transportation.\nAs far as plot goes the  plot is the plot starts off okay. Then about two hours in goes in a  different direction. It is fine for a while then but around the end is a  large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much  of a climax. They lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the  Tales Of Destiny ending. Also the characters don't have very strong and  noticeable personalities. Also if you keep up with it you won't like the  direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw.\nAs far as control goes  it's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about  it.\nThe graphics to this game are not very good. It is done in sprites.  Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings  of this game. On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and  short. The drawings are basic and too simple. There was only one of the  dragons I liked the look of. However there is a little onion that can  follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a  single character. The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to  buy this game if you do.\nAnd finally as far as length of time it can stay  interesting the game is longer them many RPGs won't be beaten on a short  rental.

Although BOFIII isn't a radical departure from the earlier games in the series, don't let that turn you off; it's reassuring to see that sprite graphics haven't given way entirely to origami-style polygons. Sporting a quasi-medieval European setting, a heroic story line, and turn-based battles, BOFIII will appeal to fans of Square's Final Fantasy series and Working Designs' Lunar titles. An Epic Journey Breath of Fire III starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before it's captured. The dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named Ryu, who is befriended by a pair of delinquents, whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people. Ryu is left for dead, but his dragon powers revive him, so he sets off in pursuit of his friends' captors, unaware that he's about to be drawn into an ever-deepening pool of danger, deceit, and death. Like earlier BOF titles, Ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey. Nina, the princess of Windia, makes another appearance in the series, although in this game she's apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations. Ryu, too, shares the name of a character from the series, but he's also unrelated. However, Gobi, from the first BOF game, makes a cameo appearance. Nostalgic Graphics Graphically, BOFIII is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors. Texture-mapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds, terrain, and buildings, while sprites are used to compose the various characters. More animation, colors, and special effects have been added to this version, but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the BOF games. The three-quarter-overhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles, but not to any great extent. Battles are fought directly on the field map, with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions: Two are seen from the front and two from the rear.\nSolid Craftsmanship The battle system is turn-based, with some consideration given to quickness: Characters move in sequence to their speed parameter. For example, in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down. Also, certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting. Beyond the usual manual, magic, and item attacks, characters can transform into dragons. Initially, only Ryu has the power to transform (and only when he's far into the game), but the other characters gain that power later. Transformation, though, requires crystals called Dragon Genes and AP (magic points) for the Genes chosen. By combining up to three Genes, different dragons can be created; the more Genes you use, the more powerful your dragon, though you'll use more AP. AP is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle. Finally, you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells. The construction of Breath Of Fire III's battle system-and of the whole game, for that matter-is very polished-thanks to excellent controls. You won't be moaning about the way this game handles. Sound Bites However, all isn't well in BOFIII. The sound effects are fine, if not particularly inspired. In battle, the characters emit rudimentary shouts, screams, and spell names, but not much more. And even though the sounds can get annoying, they're not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack. The music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz, and more often than not, it doesn't add to the atmosphere of the story. The music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy RPG. Aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack, BOFIII is worth a long look from RPG fans.

It wasn't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back, but the overall gameplay as well. Almost everything about this game was done right, and there is very little to complain about.\n\nTekken 2 takes place 2 years after the events of the first Tekken. The plot isn't very well developed and isn't really involving, but everything else more than makes up for it. The graphics (for the time) were amazing and the animations were also nicely done. The roster includes 24 characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced. The game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it. The controls are simple and intuitive, and I always believed that this control scheme (each button controls a limb-ex. left punch, right punch) is one of the best for fighting games.\n\nFor modes, you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters. You also have a vs. mode, a team battle mode (which is very enjoyable), a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a practice mode. All of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes.\n\nThe combat system is still excellent to this day. The amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed. There also aren't really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken (such as excessive juggling).\n\nOverall, this game is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played. With plenty of characters to learn, plenty of modes to choose from, amazing looking backgrounds, and a terriffic combat system, there is no reason to skip this game.

But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money, Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, on the PlayStation. The only thing added to the game is super cancels, which allow you to string multiple super combos together. Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought, so some characters' cancels work better than others. In fact, the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought. Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game, the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible, unbalanced, pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game. One of the few things the arcade version (and the Saturn version, which was an arcade-perfect translation) had going for it was the graphics. They weren't spectacular, but the characters were large, colorful, and used a lot of frames of animation. The PlayStation, a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D, simply can't handle that much data. So Capcom chopped out tons of frames (Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still, and his attacks are about two frames). The graphics look very washed out, and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown. Ken's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out, and it still slows the game down to a crawl. The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay. The arcade version's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight. Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack, as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks. Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory, the tag feature has been completely removed. You still pick a second character (cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version), but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters. To make up for the shortened play time, the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format. Characters also slowly regain life, much like your backup character would in the arcade. This game just shouldn't exist. At some point in the development cycle, someone should have stepped in, seen that the PlayStation simply couldn't do justice to the original game, and pulled the plug. It took an additional 4MB of RAM to get the Saturn, which already has more RAM than the PlayStation, to run a perfect version of the game.

This game however feels a little bit different than the other games in this series, though I'm not excatly sure why. I think the main reasons it feels so different are: the graphics, the story line, the music, and the character differnces. Graphicaly wise, you can tell it's older, but the graphics have a certain charm to them. The few out-of-engine motion scenes though, are magnificent! However, the graphic style is drasticaly different from it's sequels. The plot is overall, a little more \"classic fantasyish\" and feels kinda like something you might read in a book (which is probably what they were aiming at since it has a \"book theme\"). It has a bit of a melancholy feel to it; which makes it feel slightly more intense than it's sequals. Actually, I think it's the best story of any of the Klonoa games. As for the ending, I loved it! Sad and moving without being overly sad. I think it's my favorite vidoe game ending! The BGM is a different style than Lunatea's Veil also, (It's PS2 sequal) less solemn and RPG like, and a little more lively, or something, not really sure what the word is, it fits the game well. What I mean by character differneces is that it has no familiar characters other than Klonoa and Huepow. Klonoa, however, is quite different than in his sequels. Dispite these differences, the gameplay is practicaly clone-copy of the others in the series, esspecial Lunatea's Veil. From what I have heard, many people that played this were dissapointed with the sequel. I think that it was probably because they were used to this style and didn't give it much of a chance (personaly, I was dissapointed with THIS game at first, then started to really like it after I got used to it). Anyway, bottom line is, that if you've played all the other Klonoa games, expect this one to be a little different, but defenently get it, if you enjoyed the others, you'll enjoy this! If you haven't played any of the other games in this great series, it's based on engaging gameplay with simplistic controls. This game is one of the few \"2.5D\" games in existance. It plays parellel to a 2D game (people still hanging onto their old copies of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or Mario Bros. should try this). In this game, however, you are in a 3D environment (don't worry, the paths are clearly defined, you won't have any trouble figuring out where you can and can't go). You can interact with the background by throwing things into it, this is esspecially key in some bosses, This is the 2.5D part. There are 12 levels (not counting the final boss)in this game, plus an unlockable time attack level. This game is pretty easy, and if your looking for an extreamly hard, nail biting, challenge, this probably isn't for you. This is more of a fun, relaxing game.

It holds up well, but is a definite acquired taste.\n\nTomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills.\n\nScattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress. This is where combat comes into play. Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo. Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms, however these weapons do have limited ammo, but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle.\nThe last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save.\n\nThis game has many flaws, but it is a very rewarding experience. I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge. The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here. If you're curious about the beginning of the franchise you won't be disappointed, but maybe a little stressed.\n\nFor classic PC gamers I'd recommend Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business.

It was a smash hit, and has since spawned many sequels to the original game.\n\nThe graphics are a nice step  forward from earlier RPG platforms including: NES, SNES, Sega, etc.\n\nThe controls are challenging, and to someone who doesn't want to take the time getting used to it impossible. However, when you buy an RPG you want a challenge, and Tomb Raider delivers that on all levels. As far as game control goes, it will definitely take some patience to learn the many skills Lara can do. She can do a variety of things like different jumps, flips, crawling, fighting moves, etc. If you have no patience, this game will drive you crazy. It really is a shame that some people tear down this game, when they have no idea what they are talking about. Who wants to play an RPG with no challenge, not me. This game takes time to learn how to master the acrobatic moves, fighting moves, jumps, etc. I like that, and if challenge is what you want, this delivers. Once you learn how the controls operate, you realize it is quite easy to use.\n\nThe graphics are really well done, and definitely an improvement over older platforms, too. The characters, and scenery are much sharper, in higher definition for then previous platforms, and more with more colors. One of my favorite characters is the huge T-Rex you must fight. It looks like a T-Rex, too. The graphics are just awesome. I love how the blood flies, when you kill an animal. Previous platforms didn't really do that, and  in such detail.\n\nAnother thing that made it better over older platforms is the continued ability to move freely about the landscape unrestricted, but with even more vantage points. You can view yourself from pretty much any angle. Top, bottom, sides, any angle, at any given moment. You can watch yourself from the side, then go to top view, bottom view, etc, etc. It's just awesome the advances over previous RPG platforms.\n\nThe music in this game is very well done, and of CD sound quality. The music is crystal clear, and fits the game perfectly. The background music is often very hauntingly eerie. Also, the sound effects are of nice CD sound quality, too.\n\nThis game has many, many hours of game play that will keep you busy for awhile. Lots of different scenery in different places of the world. You find yourself in a variety of places, and not just dungeons, and caves, but there is plenty of that, as well.\n\nIf getting through the many challenging levels, and trying to stay alive isn't enough for you, there are many, many hidden secrets for you too find, also. Some are easy to find, some are pretty challenging to find.\n\nIf you love exploring caves, catacombs, dungeons, and having to constantly fight, then you will love this game. Lots of challenges, puzzles, and lots of ways to die, too.

Lara's Madonna-style pyramid breasts) and jerky low frame rate - BUT WHO CARES.  \"Tomb Raider\" was one of the first fully-realized 3D games, with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully - something next-gen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes - and, of course, best of all, an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with.  Yes, Lara Croft - men want her, women want to be her...lol.  Forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and (worst of all) the PS2 platform.  Even on the PS1, all the new innovations in graphics and AI that cropped up in subsequent TR installments couldn't improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut.  The puzzles, the secrets, the at-times relentless action, this game has it all.\n\nMuch like Indiana Jones, we first encounter Lara as she explores some ruins in South America - allegedly the village of Vilcabamba, an actual archeological site in Ecuador, although as it appears in the game it's more of a generic hotch-pot of pre-Columbian art and architecture.  Of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere, and of course she eventually finds a golden idol - more nods to Indy.  Later she explores Las Vegas versions of Rome and Egypt, slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet (PETA just loved this game) before proceeding to - where else? - Atlantis, which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants.  All this because she's in search of an artifact whose magical powers, if in the wrong hands, could destroy the world, or something.\n\nIt's easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot, but that doesn't affect the entertainment value - again just like with Indy, you know it's stupid, but you're more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride.  Getting through the levels is not always easy; you'll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzle-solving skills.

Back then, games such as Resident Evil and Tomb Raider were ground-breaking milestones in entertainment known as video games.  I won't talk about Resident Evil here because everyone knows about that.\nTomb Raider was the first game to give players control of a character in a true 3D environment.  Sure, you had games like Doom and Wolfenstien, but they played only on a single plane with your character spinning on an axis.  Tomb Raider allowed you to control Lara, the feminine version of Indiana Jones, an use the environments such as cliffs, roofs, etc. to progress through the levels.  Level design in Tomb Raider is really what the game is centered around.  Beautiful, stunning, breath-taking, eerie, surreal, all describe the level design here.  Nothing short of ingenious.\nThe game mechanics and control of Lara were never the best, but they were also adequate to get the job done.  Lara spins on a fixed axis when the player turns left and right, and forward makes her run in the direction she is facing.  Turning can sometimes be a chore, especially when the action is turned up a notch.  Luckily, the circle button makes Lara do a somersault tumble, for a quick \"about-face\".  The shimmying and climbing from ledge to ledge and jumping has always been amazing.  Combine that with sliding down angular rock formations and time jumps and grabs to ledges, and you are bound to fall in love with the action that Eidos developed (NOTE: This kind of mechanics shined most for me in this game as opposed to all the predecessors, including Angel of Darkness for PS2.  This kind of action became less and less as the series went on, save for Last Revelation, maybe).  The swimming sequences and puzzles are also a really wonderful treat as well.\nThere are plenty of surprises in this game that I don't want to give away, however, I will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long, long time after.  For example, \"The God Room\" of St. Francis' Folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that I've played.\nSo why am I writing this review now, 7 years after the release date?  For a few reasons.  First, being that I can't get the game out of my head for more than a few months.  Every six months I go back to it.  The second reason, is that when I bought a PS2, I knew I would be playing the original Tomb Raider again and wanted that backward capability.  And THIRD and quite possibly the most important (and the reason I titled this review \"Dear Eidos\") is that Angel of Darkness was the single reason that I sold my PS2 for an X-Box.  At first I enjoyed AOD, but the game has rampant problems.  I've always welcomed a new Tomb Raider game in my life and gave AOD more than one chance.  I loved all the other PS1 Tomb Raider games, including III, which got a lot of harsh and unwarranted criticisms in my mind, but whatever.  I hated AOD and want Eidos to know that.  And FOURTH reason is that I repurchased the new and compact PSOne last week.  I still own my Tomb Raider from back in the day.  Last night I played it and the magic was back like from the first time I played it.  Sure the graphics feel older, but they are by no means bad at all considering that I play games like Halo, Crimson Skies, Prince of Persia, and Rainbow Six 3 on the X-Box.  There will always be a large place in my geeky video-gaming heart for this true classic.\nEIDOS: TAKE THE POWER BACK!", "summary": "Dear Eidos,", "unixReviewTime": 1074124800}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "3", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2002", "reviewerID": "A3HTX1NOTTWERP", "asin": "B000006RGS", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Busy Body", "reviewText": "So, this is where it all began - the original Tomb Raider. In November 1996, Britain was changing. With the phenomenal success of the Spice Girls and the phrase \"girl power\", there wasn't a better time to bring out an all-female computer game heroine who kicked [rear]! Enter Lara Croft. The game went straight to No. 1 all over the world and shifted more than 10 million copies to become THE biggest selling PlayStation game of all time. Lara soon became a cultural icon, gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over - and not just computer magazines, mainstream magazines such as Rolling Stone and Time; undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world. Four sequels followed in the form of Tomb Raider II, Tomb Raider III, Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider IV: Chronicles. The five games have sold a combined total of 40 million worldwide and secured Eidos Interactive and more importantly, Lara Croft and Tomb Raider, a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest, most popular and enjoyable computer games of all time.\nThe story of Tomb Raider is simple really. Lara Croft is a semi-famous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman, Natla (last name unknown) to search the globe for an ancient artifact, known as the Scion, that is beleived to have come from the lost city of Atlantis. Lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it, she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize. Around halfway through the game, while uncovering clues about the artifact in question, Lara also unveils the truth about Natla; a story told through amazing cut-scenes. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more, yet never for the game to end.\nThe game begins with simple, pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls. The enemies are only small in the first few levels; bats, dogs etc. that can be eliminated with a single shot of Lara's Pistols - a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo. The game has a massive 16 levels that will keep you playing for months - it took me 10 months to complete. In fact, I finished the week Tomb Raider II came out so once I'd finished with the first, I spent the next 10 months playing the second one! This has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five Tomb Raider games for around 6 years without a break! I remember the days when I bought this game...I was only 10 and it scared me to death! The enemies may not look very real, but remember that controlling Lara is! You control her every move so her life is in your hands! At the time the game was released, the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking. The former is not so much now, but the latter still stands. Graphics in computer games have come a very long way since 1996, but half an hours' play on Tomb Raider with Ms Croft, and its superior excellence shines through. The final levels are set in and around Atlantis, and are classic moments in video gaming history. From the rocky cliffs of Asia, to the hot muggy forests of South America and the haunting and eerie lost island of Atlantis, there's something here for everyone. Buy it now!\nOVERALL GRADE: 10/10\nAll in all, Tomb Raider is the ultimate PlayStation game. Everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable. The atmosphere, the sounds the animals make, the noises Lara makes when falling off a rock, the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen - everything! This is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved 6 years ago. If you haven't got Tomb Raider in your PlayStation games collection, it is not complete. Only when you purchase all 5 Tomb Raider games will your collection be complete. With the soon-to-be released Lara Croft Timb Raider VI: The Angel Of Darkness, all six Tomb Raider will keep me playing for decades, literally. I will still be playing Tomb Raider when I'm 60 years old, and I'm sure I'll not be the only one...", "summary": "Tomb Raider is a classic - Lara Croft is an icon!", "unixReviewTime": 1031011200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2002", "reviewerID": "A3JX74J0LE924A", "asin": "B000006RGS", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Lisa Houghtaling", "reviewText": "It's great to play if you have nothing to do well anyaway.

Unlike its sequels, it stays in the tombs and out of other settings.  I believe that it is one of the best games ever made, and it certainly is a classic.  However, I believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow it.\nThe scenery in Tomb Raider is better than most games, although it is mostly cubed and flat.  The game play and plot are wonderful, and the graphics and sounds are acceptable.  However, the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent, and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles.  Laura's moves are limited, and the weapons supply is less than perfect.\nI would recommend this game to any fan of the Tomb Raider series and to the average gamer.  However, I do feel that other versions have better qualities.  Tomb Raider II offers wonderful AI and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat. Tomb Raider III combines the better aspects of the previous two, and Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation offers the best plot and character mobility.

Jongeling", "reviewText": "Fighting Force was the wanna-be \"Streets Of Rage\" for PlayStation. If you grew up in the 90's and owned a Sega you'll know what I'm talking about. The game had tons of flaws such as the lo-fidelity sound effects (sssshhhhheeeewwwmmm) and the blocky PC-like design of the characters. Heck, it looked like a Windows 95 platform game.\n\nThere are four characters to choose from : two chicks, a big giant and the handsome one. They each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings. Smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too; but he's slow as a mule. Hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits. Alana and Mace are both quick (alana moreso) but are weak and fragile.\n\nThe game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the game's engine. Back then, games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly. The load times on this game tell you there's a lot of extra space here. An obvious pitfall is when there are many enemies/items on the screen it evokes slow command response but ONLY from players' controllers (remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an 'air grab' 1 second after you press the button?). This resulted in getting beat up from 5 or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head. Not fun. Items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first. Then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and you're spinning through the air. Fun! Yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot. And for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the face.\n\nYou eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it. The game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though I've learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way. The game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue (which, by the way starts you over on the level...totally bogus!). When you finally DO finish the game it seems underwhelming. You'll see what I mean when you finish it.\n\nAll in all, despite its obvious and frustrating flaws, the game is still a classic.

Compare it to when it frist came out, bar none!  5/5, although the animation can sometime slow down.\n\n  Sound- Ain't nothing more prettier than hearing your enemies bone crunch!  5/5\n\n  Control- Obviously this is the black-sheep of the family.

The 2nd installment in the TR series is not much different.  The levels are still HUGE, and exploration is still the name of the game.  But this time around, the environments and enemies are more varied, there are more action-based enemy sequences than the first, and the difficulty level has been approriately increased.  In terms of the level of challenge, I feel that this is the best in the series.  The later Tomb Raider series felt frustrating and downright cheap at times.  This one is definitely not a cakewalk, but is very possible without a strategy guide.  You don't feel as though you have to play for half an hour just to get into the next room.  Progress is slow, but steady, and you don't ever need 6 or 7 different items to move on.  Progress is more based on actually getting where you want to go rather than finding the right items or hitting the right combination of switches.  Some of the level designs are incredible, such as the Venice-based levels, the Opera House, the beastly Barkhang Monestary and the massive Temple Of Xian.  This is the key strength of the first two TR installments, and why the more recent ones have been less inspiring.  Resourcefulness and attention to the environment is extremely key, as medipacks are in light supply in this game.  Also, every level has 3 secrets in the form of dragons.  You do not receive the bonus items unless you find all 3 dragons in the level, making exploration even more vital in building your inventory.  Finding at least 2 of the dragons in every level should be quite easy, but some levels have one especially well-hidden dragon.  The gold dragons in the first two levels are remarkably difficult, but the reward of finding them (especially the first one) is worth it.  If you didn't like the first Tomb Raider, this game won't change your mind.  If you were blown away by the first installment (or even the 3rd, 4th or 5th) then this game is a real treat.", "summary": "Still holds up", "unixReviewTime": 1045526400}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "15", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2002", "reviewerID": "A3HTX1NOTTWERP", "asin": "B000006RGR", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Busy Body", "reviewText": "Tomb Raider 2 is my absolute favourite PlayStation game of all-time! I bought the game in December 1997, around the same time I got my PlayStation. But I never really liked Tomb Raider 2 and only managed to get halfway through the first level, before forgetting about it for a while. Four years later, in the summer of 2001, I dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide. What a shock I got!\n\nAfter the phenomenal, worldwide success of the original Tomb Raider in November 1996, the Eidos Interactive guys put together the sequel, which, in a rare case, surpasses the original with flying colours. To save the game in the first, you had to find a crystal before continuing, wheras in Tomb Raider 2 you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like. This comes as a great help, especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes. Lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game. The first game featured Pistols, Shotgun and Uzis - that was about it. But with this game, you get weapons such as the Grenade Launcher and an M-16 Assault Rifle. While Tomb Raider 1 focused more on enemies in animal form, Tomb Raider 2 has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human. But the most notable change on Tomb Raider 2 is the welcome addition of vehicles. Tomb Raider featured none what so ever, but Tomb Raider 2 has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in Venice and the snowmobile in Tibetian Foothills. Lara also took advantage of a make-over. The graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game, but Lara herself has changed a lot; her hair is no longer tied in a bun, but flows freely down her back in a pony tail. The reason this wasn't featured in the first game is because the technology wasn't good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail - they couldn't get it to move in motion with her body (rather silly when you think about it now). Lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces. The improved engine also served better lighting facilities, which allowed Ms Croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas. When it comes to the levels, the highlights are Venice, Offshore Rig, Tibetian Foothills (short but sweet - involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key, before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level), Barkhang Monastery (HINT: Whatever you do, DON'T shoot the monks, they are here to help! They will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you don't have to kill them! Accidently shoot one, and you'll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you!) and Temple of Xian.\n\nOVERALL GRADE: 10/10\n\nTomb Raider 2 is, in my opinion, the greatest PlayStation game there has ever been. Yes, the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since - especially on the PlayStation 2 and X-Box, but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is. And in that category, it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever. Hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the Tomb Raider games and fail miserably.

Street Fighter Collection contains Super Street Fighter 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, and Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, a slightly updated version of Street Fighter Alpha 2. The original Street Fighter 2, Champion Edition, and Hyper Fighting are nowhere to be found. The result is a shallow package that should have been so much more. The graphics and gameplay in the Super games are almost identical to what you remember. Every frame of original animation appears intact, and there isn't any noticeable slowdown. However, the graphics do appear a bit fuzzy. The sound is decent, and the music even speeds up and intensifies when a character is near death. The second disc contains Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold. The game is almost entirely identical to Street Fighter Alpha 2, with only a few differences. First, any character that was in Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition can switch between normal and Champion Edition modes. Playing a CE version of a character disables his super meter and changes a few moves here and there. The CE character graphics are still Alpha 2-style. Also, there is now an Akuma mode, which pits your character against Akuma over and over again instead of fighting all the other characters. Also, Cammy is hidden in the game. She appears in her X-Men vs. Street Fighter costume. All this is fine and good, but what about all the other great Street Fighter games? Where's SF2 Turbo: Hyper Fighting? Or the original SF2, complete with Guile's \"handcuffs\" and all the other weird little glitches?

Whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws, Street Fighter II's strength was superb, well-balanced, uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master.  Street Fighter Collection accurately reproduces that gameplay, making for an excellent anthology, but not a flawless one.\nFirstly, the omission of the first three iterations of Street Fighter II is glaring.  Given the lack of complexity of those games, one has to wonder if Capcom's developers were too lazy (or their marketers too greedy) to finish those titles for this release, instead leaving them for Street Fighter Collection II.  Graphically the games are preserved admirably, although CD audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up, unlike in the arcade games.  The long load times are excruciating, as is each title requiring its own Memory Card block, when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single block.\nThe inclusion of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is nice, but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection.  Perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original Street Fighter Alpha 2 to market, and tried to save face by placing the more polished Gold version in this compilation.  And since this third title requires its own Memory Card block, Street Fighter Collection actually requires three blocks in all, not one as is advertised on the packaging.\nStill, all three games have withstood the test of time, and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value.

When I play it today, I still think it's boring! WWF War Zone is the first real WWF wrestling game to be released on the Playstation. I don't really consider the In Your House game to be wrestling wise, but more Mortal Kombat like.\n\nWar Zone is based off the WWF roster from late 1997 to early 1998, featuring only the most popular stars in the game . Among the wrestlers in this game, you can choose to play as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, The Rock, Triple H, Mankind, Goldust, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, Farrooq, British Bulldog, Ken Shamrock, and The Headbangers.\n\nThe opening of the game is cool, as you're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s. From there on, you're taken to the menu screen that's in the form of an elevator. In the menu you can look at the wrestlers' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game. There's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game.\n\nOnce you enter the game, you can either play Exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to Challenge Mode. Among the match types available are Singles, Tag Team, Tornado Tag Team, Hardcore, or Steel Cage. The Steel Cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play. When you climb the cage, I didn't know what button to push to climb down. I pushed down but I just ended up climbing back down to the ring. I lost most of the Cage matches.\n\nChallenge Mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the World Championship. Unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play. Once you play one match, you've played them all. You have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones. As you progress through, you'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match. Oh yeah, that's another thing. If you lose 1 or 2 matches, you're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up. It ultimately screws you over and you're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again.\n\nOverall: I found War Zone boring then and I find it boring now. In my opinion In Your House is more fun to play than this. Even the sequel game to War Zone, Attitude, is more fun to play than War Zone. So if you don't want to be bored, skip War Zone and buy In Your House or Attitude instead", "summary": "Boring Game!", "unixReviewTime": 1400716800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "12 20, 2012", "reviewerID": "A3TQTYD0D6AUO3", "asin": "B000007NJC", "reviewerName": "Steve F", "reviewText": "Use to play this as a kid and when I played it, it brought back all kinds of memories from my childhood.

Let me state right away: graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me.  The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good (and original, back in the day) but who cares?  It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic, and their movements true to life.  Who cares?  When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90's yeah, the graphics WERE cool.  Not now, especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism.\n\nYou know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level.  A whole new level of crap.  You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same.  Let me explain why this is a bad thing.\n\nYou know when you buy an updated sports video game (such as football or hockey) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names, and maybe some new options here and there?  That's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games.  For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other, and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc.  Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism.  I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game.  A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it.  And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago.  It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games.\n\nBefore WWF War Zone, you had WWF In Your House which, to this day, is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games (along with WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game).  Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis.  Once again, the formula in those old-school wrestling games didn't stick around and overstay its welcome.  Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much.\n\nThe very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong.  Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach.  It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing.  After a while you get sick of it.\n\nWWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights, but it was the WORST thing that could have happened.  Graphically, WWF War Zone is the first of its kind.  Being the first means it's bound to have some flaws (despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw!)  Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is.  After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House, we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly.  Painfully slow, in fact.  Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race.  Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game.  To be fair, the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed.  Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago.\n\nWWF War Zone also started the popular \"create a wrestler\" mode.  But it doesn't matter because, as I mention above, wrestling games for 10 years have had that option.  It's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill, and it's time game companies got rid of it, or did something to drastically change it.  It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now, 10 years later, I don't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again.\n\nI tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it, so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away.  No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games.\n\nIf only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today, instead of repeating the same formula every year, I wouldn't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began.  After 10 years, updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesn't get the job done.", "summary": "the absolute low point", "unixReviewTime": 1152748800}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "15", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "09 9, 2000", "reviewerID": "AAQ75C4BJUQLO", "asin": "B000009QCX", "reviewerName": "Sixto Limiac", "reviewText": "Kartia: \"The Word Of Fate\" (recognized as Rebus in Japan), crams  fabulous innovation in one decent Strategy/RPG. Although Atlus has released  a few worthy games on the PlayStation console, Atlus begins to grow as a  company who'll soon promote their selves into a house-hold name. Like the  arising empire of Enix. Despite the humiliation from their most  embarrassing game, Eggs of Steel, Atlus is gaining momentum with their  not-notch RPGs.  Taking corresponding steps alike with Ogre Tactics and  my all time precious- Final Fantasy Tactics-, Kartia packs  charming  innovations. Sure, Kartia may not have the excellent job systems like FFT,  or any archers for the matter, yet it brings temples of innovations to bury  the burden. It has Phantoms. Once the player ons his PlayStation, the  player selects his  decision to accept the role of Toxe or Lacryma. Each  character has a totally different story process.  The niddy-griddy fun in  Kartia is concentrating on your arsenal of Phantoms. They are  paper-rock-scissors monsters.  All phantoms can be defeated by a specific  one and vise versa.  Phantoms play the most basic role.  During the game,  the player uses them to create elemental magic or specialize weapons.  Assembling the player's own infantry takes a critical job for victory or  instant death. The objectives in Kartia are alike with FFT's system. From  claiming the lives of your adversaries to escorting a vital character,  Kartia has the same fundamentals of any Strategy/RPG game.  What really  amazes, is the addition to disturb the environment. Players have the  opportunity to cut down trees down for a bridge and order a magician to  freeze a pool of water for walking.  Battling enemies on the vast  terrain is exciting, but the game loses some valuable points from being  completely linear. Gladly, there is another innovation that covers that  burden as well, the 2P Mode. Final Fantasy Tactics could have been truly  flawless if Square decided to include the 2P Mode. Kartia takes  Strategy/RPGs deeper. The 2P Mode allows two players to battle their armies  on saved data. Players can also trade items.  The ONLY downslope going  for Kartia is the abrupt end.  Kartia is an engrossing story. With  a tale like this, why not bring an anime in the movie industry?  Both  characters have dissimilar story progressions. Loxe is a young boy who  enjoys the elegance of swordplay a bit too much. Lacryma is an incredibly  robust Shrine Knight. It's up to these two heroes to protect the land from  barbaric rebels. Heroes fighting the bad rebels may sound dull and boring,  but once the backstabs roll in, there's no way the player can let the  controller free again. Someone, anyone, make Kartia an anime!  Graphically Kartia is a 3D splendor. The vibrant colors hold an artistic  environment. When a person speaks, a dialogue box is set above the screen  and the character's faces appear. At the FMV department, the videos are  dark, and morbid that triumphantly stimulates your daily dose of eye-candy.  Music thrives to hand the player spectacular soundings.  The beats can  really adjure you in an edge of your seat thrill.  Atlus has succeeded to  create a game that goes beyond the redundant  RPGs today.  Don't be fooled  by Kartia's age or lack of popularity. This is a solid buy.  FFT fans, run-  kill only if necessary- to grab a hold of this monster.  2P mode shines and  awaits for your arrival.

Although it's rare to see a snowboarding game play out like Mario Kart, it makes for a really fun game. You play as one of 6 grade school children, collect items and weapons, knock off enemies with these items and weapons, do tricks, and get money while trying to win the race. Even though the childish characters may intimidate many who see this game, this still is a great game. The game looks pretty nice for N64 standards, the controls are tight, the sounds are good and the music is very catchy. This game also uses great ideas, such as saving money to upgrade your snowboard or playing on really wacky (but really enjoyable) courses. In fact, some of the courses have no snow on them! But that's the fun of this game: getting to snowboard down unimaginable terrain, while at the same time, hitting your opponents with pie-pans, bombs, rocks and other items. It releases some kind of childhood glee deep in your brain that I just can't explain. But it's not all fun and games though. There are some problems. First, is the game's image. Many are really going to be turned off by the childish nature of this game, though I liked it so much, I didn't care. The biggest problem is that you need a Conroller Pak to save your data. The real gripes here is that there is no battery backed memory option along with the Controller Pak use and since the game requires 121 of the 123 pages in the Controller Pak, you'll need to spend more money getting more Controller Paks if you have other games that require it also (Mystical Ninja starring Goemon, Rugrats In Paris) or games where you want to save data for safe keeping (Wave Race 64, Perfect Dark). But even with these issues, the game is still really fun and worth playing. If you like it and still want more, try its sequel, Snowboard Kids 2.

It had hilarious sound effects, great controls, a few varieties of boards to chose from, and solid looking graphics. It is also fun to get power ups and shoot down your friends to get in the lead. What's really cool about this game is the chair lift at the end of the run. To get back to the top of the mountain you have to go up a chairlift, but the chaos that happens to be the first person to ride the chairlift is hilarious. The only thing that turns people off from the game is that there are only four riders to choose from, and they're all little kids. In other games like Mario Kart, there is more characters to chose from, but the character choices are only a minor con. It also has an incredibly babyish look towards it that can be a slight turn off for older kids.  But once you can \"read past its cover\" the game can be so much fun to play with friends and family.

Twisted Metal 3 is like an abomination that should have never been made.  989 ruined the whole spirit and everything that made Twisted Metal 2 one of the best games ever made.  The only thing I would give this sequel over the previous game was that the cars graphically look a little better.  The game is so frustrating from the controls that it makes it no fun to play.  Everything got worse instead of better.\n\nStory and Characters\nThey brought back the taxi from the first game, added a grandma and a Flower Power 60's car.  Yeah not a lot else needs to be said all 3 suck.  They got rid of some of the fun characters from the 2nd game like Shadow and Mr. Slam for those 3 and changed some of the names probably a copyright issue between the companies.  Not a big deal but still why not just keep the names the same.  The story is pretty much the same but uses 3D graphics instead of the animation theme.  I personally thought the animation from 2 was great and added a lot of fun to the game.  I loved beating TM2 with each character to see the multiple endings.  This game is so frustrating you will get none of that same enjoyment from this game.\n\nPlay Control\nIs ridiculous in this game it is way over responsive to the point where it is hard to even drive the vehicles.  Just driving over power ups seems like a chore to pickup when they should be easy.  The wonderful freeze element in TM2 does not work near as well in this game.  The play control in TM2 was outstanding, every vehicle was easy to learn and play.  Not so in this monstrosity.\n\nStages & Backgrounds\nThe stages and backgrounds seem cramped and you don't get the feel of exploration you did in the previous game.  The cars all stay pretty close to you, so you don't do much searching for opponents on the other end of stages.  Gone are the fun elements of Antarctica falling to pieces or environmental dangers such as Moscow or the ruins of Latin America surrounded by lava.  Instead you get Egypt, The North Pole, Washington DC, London and Tokyo.  None of which is very exciting. I found the background boring and uninspiring.\n\nChallenge\nThis game is cheap as hell, but not in the way you would think.  Instead of all the cars fighting each other, it seems like all the opponents just gang up on you alone so the odds are always 4 to 1 or 5 to 1 instead of even.  When you get a few opponents life bars way down they run off looking for your health powerups, that's right they wimp out stop engaging and run for health before they start attacking you again.  When I first saw this in the game I thought you have to be kidding me.  What programmer would add that in.  It really ruins the gaming experience and is frustrating.  When I died in TM2 I was eager to start the stage over and get revenge on the car that destroyed me but that does not really happen in this game because it takes so much longer just to destroy an enemy car because they are running after health the whole time.  The bosses are pretty much the same I thought the final boss was not unoriginal. The radar in this game is not nearly as good as with the previous game making it hard to track your prey and see where they are at on the grid.\n\nVerdict\nAvoid this game like the plague.  The cars and graphics may look better but you will have a better time beating your head against a wall that playing this game.  the endings and stories are not as good, the play control is awful.  The challenge is way to high because of cheap tactics. The radar is not really helpful.  All in All it is the worst game in the series.  I hated this game save your money or just buy the Twisted Metal 1 or 2.\n\nGameplay: 3/10\nPlay Control: 1/10 (over responsive to the point of frustration)\nStory\\Originality: 2/10\nChallenge: 10/10\nFun Factor\\Replay Value: 1/10", "summary": "This game flat out sucks ruining everything that was great about TM2", "unixReviewTime": 1435795200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2015", "reviewerID": "A31GXMYI6RJ9BG", "asin": "B00000DMB6", "reviewerName": "Mike", "reviewText": "Classic Game,came as expected, lightly used no excessive wear.", "summary": "Thumbs Up", "unixReviewTime": 1431129600}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2015", "reviewerID": "A238IX6INYRVX4", "asin": "B00000DMB6", "reviewerName": "Jonathan K.", "reviewText": "Stays true to the original.

Still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later.\n\nTwisted Metal 2: Most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically...\n\nTwisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral.\n\nTwisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1.\n\nTwisted Metal Black: First Playstation 2 release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name Incognito entertainment.  Best Graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games.  With nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now)  this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series.\n\nTwisted Metal Head On: This is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.", "summary": "Twisted Metal Series Review", "unixReviewTime": 1386115200}, {"overall": 3.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2013", "reviewerID": "A22QYM5WUYSKHK", "asin": "B00000DMB6", "reviewerName": "Travis Foster", "reviewText": "Although I should probably first say the disc its self was in perfect condition I was not satisfied.

The trilogy is probably best described as a vehicular version of Midway's Mortal Kombat or else a James Cameron's Terminator take on a demolition derby. In it, a horde of over-the-top characters compete against each other in cars and trucks armed with missiles, freeze rays, and other assorted weapons of destruction. This time out, there are a few new cars and weapons, and you have an option to have a computer-controlled ally aide you in the tournament, though he always seems to be the first one blown up in the fight. The biggest change to the series though is that its developer has changed from SingleTrac (who've started a new, but like-minded, auto-combat series under the moniker Rogue Trip for GT Interactive) to 989 Studios, a Sony-owned development studio. This affects the game on nearly every level. Graphically, the game appears much differently from the previous titles in the line, though it's not necessarily improved. There are various shading and lighting effects at work, but the end result is somehow grainy and washed out. The title's soundtrack, which is comprised of songs by Rob Zombie and Pitch Shifter, is very fitting, but the supporting sound effects are very weak. For example, the machine gun sounds like a cap pistol and driving through water inexplicably sounds pretty similar to that.\nThe game's much-touted new physics engine turns out pretty strange in function. The cars will now dip and roll upon collision, which sounds fantastic in theory, but in practice is fairly questionable since vehicles will often flip over after hitting a small curb or even a snowman. The collision detection is also highly suspect, as instances where you'll find yourself stuck on a ledge or halfway into a wall are frequent. It's very nice to have analog control this time, but the physics engine really works against it. The main downfall of Twisted Metal III though is its lackluster level design. Most of the stages are, if not modeled after, extremely reminiscent of levels from the first two games, and those that aren't are even more uninspired. The Washington level, for instance, is a long rectangular courtyard with a ramped area on one end and teleportation sphere (which sends vehicles to the ramped area) on the other. Snore.\nIn the two player modes, the default horizontal split-screen runs into the same problem found in SingleTrac's Rogue Trip. Since the levels are no longer as flat as in the previous TM games, having half you horizon cut away makes it hard to see in hilly or ramp-heavy levels. Fortunately, the designers had the foresight to include a wide variety of split-screen perspectives, such as a vertical cut and variations on a four-way split where the other two boxes are filled with radar, speedometer, and weapons info (these are the best since you view the world through a smaller version of the full screen). In the three- and four-player modes, the perspective is similarly cornered. Both appear to cut into the frame rate and increase the visible seams between surfaces, but not majorly. Multiple views aside though, the game is as much fun in multiplayer mode as it is in single player. As there, you'll be struck with the feelings of \"Why am I here?\" and \"Why am I playing this\" after a level or two. There are a few good ideas at work within Twisted Metal III (such as the multiple perspectives), but they're not nearly enough to counter the fact that improvements to the gameplay are pretty slight and the level design is a big step backwards, making the game a real lemon overall. If this is the direction the series is taking, it should probably stop right here. Take a look at Activision's Vigilante 8 or GT Interactive's Rogue Trip instead.", "summary": "good game", "unixReviewTime": 1062720000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2012", "reviewerID": "A2OUKHGJ85XN4U", "asin": "B00000DMB2", "reviewerName": "Charles H.", "reviewText": "I picked this up in a pack of two other N64 games for five dollars at a used game store. Now usually, those bundle deals have all of the mediocre N64 games in them that no one wants to buy individually. However, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is easily one of the best N64 games I've ever played.\n\nStory: The game appears to take place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars universe. You're Luke Skywalker, the original trilogy's protagonist and a fighter pilot for the Rebel Alliance. You'll help people with vital intelligence defect from the Empire, protect Rebel-allied cities, and of course fight the Empire!\n\nGameplay: Unfortunately, you never get to wield a light saber or anything. That's not what this game is about. It's a space-shooter. You travel to different planets in your X-wing or  one of the other Rebel spaceships and do missions.\n\nSound: There may be an N64 game with more audio than Rogue Squadron, but I've never played it, if so (and I've played entirely too many of them :P). There's so much voice-acting. There's lengthy descriptions of every ship in the Rebel Fleet, backstories for Rogue Squadron's fighter pilots, and of course in-level communication between the pilots.\n\nGraphics: It's a very nice job by Factor 5, here. Of course it looks dated by now, but in the grand scheme of things, I'd say it's aged pretty gracefully. Make sure you have an expansion pack for your system to get the full effect.\n\nReplay Value: You get medals for doing well enough in every stage. I'm told that if you get medals in every stage, you can unlock secret missions like the Battle of Hoth from Empire Strikes back and the Death Star run. If that's not incentive to beat this game 100%, what is?\n\nIt's clearly a classic N64 game, worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Goldeneye64 and Ocarina of Time.

Probably for my third time through at this point!  While Unreal doesn't have as much replay value as a game like Half Life it certainly does have its moments!  Unreal was one of those really impressive FPS games for it's time.  It boasted great graphics and intense game play.  Of course by 2008's standards these graphics merely look silly!  But if you were picking this up in '98 like I was, you were pretty impressed.\n\nI figure I'll throw in some points about playing this on a more current system, since I experienced some issues here and there.  Being a game made for Windows 98 it doesn't translate perfectly over to an XP 32 bit system.  I have no idea what this would do on Vista's 64 bit architecture.  Basically when re-installing it I got a strange error with the option to \"ignore\".  You can definitely get away with doing that and then it will install fine.  Strangely every time you reinsert the disc to play some more you have to cancel out of the install process and that \"ignore\" message comes up as well.  I'm not sure if this is just my system, but I recommend saving quite frequently, at least every time you hit a \"load\" screen.  For some reason the game will randomly crash after a little while and it exits out completely for you.  This can be frustrating if you've been playing for a while, because it doesn't auto save between load screens.  Otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system.  You can also get the Unreal Anthology which has been updated to handle Windows XP.  Oh and this was on a Pentium 4, 3.0 ghz system.\n\nThat being said, I'll move onto the actual review for anyone thinking about delving into this great game for their first time.  The first thing you notice is that you have almost no health.  You begin to discover why as you start wandering around a crashed space ship and it appears you were some kind of prisoner.  Naturally the first things you need to do are finding some health and then find some way out of the ship.  The ship is kind of a boring part of the level, but it leads you a bit into the story line because you clearly crash landed on an alien planet.  When you finally get out of the ship the first thing you'll notice is how amazing and stunning the world is that has been created for you.  Outside it's very bright and vibrant in spots.  This felt a little different compared to games like Quake, Half Life, Doom, because a lot of those games are very dark and have a major dungeon crawl atmosphere to them.  Unreal has a lot of that usual stuff as well, but it also has a lot of time spent outside where you get to see amazing scenery.  One thing the developers did right was making you feel like the in game world was huge!  This was really impressive and fun when you first got into it.\n\nAs you explore and interact with the world you learn more about what's going on with this planet called Na Pali.  Apparently the native people are called the Nali and they've been enslaved by an alien race called the Skaarj.  The Nali are extreme pacifists and I can't help but think their designers wanted them to be Buddhists for the most part.  The Skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game, though not the only enemy creatures you'll face.  They are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit.  You'll notice that the Skaarj design is clearly influenced by Predator.  They have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a Predator.  To brandish even MORE similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms.  As you can see this isn't very original.  Another part that is kind of unoriginal/strange is the Nali castles that you come across.  They are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the Skaarj who have high grade technology.  Strangely you come across large castles that look like they're straight out of thirteenth century England.  I know... strange for a race of pacifists.  Despite all this, those parts are some of the most fun to play through.  I loved going into the castles and running around!\n\nAnother aspect that made Unreal very special, when compared to other FPS games, was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game.  It truly does feel like you're on an alien world.  The sounds, the textures, were all there perfectly bringing you into this world, almost so much that you didn't want to leave!  You even hear echoes off of cliffs if you're walking through a cavern, it's like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user.  For it's time the Unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world.  They also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted.  So when I'm fighting against the Skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots.  This was really cool to see and I really only found that in games like Half Life.\n\nThe maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times.  I really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game Marathon.  A lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers, or whatever, in order to proceed onto the next section.  This game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of 20 to 30 hours to complete, so you really get your moneys worth.  The downfall to having such large maps is it's kind of easy to get lost sometimes if you're trying to complete certain tasks.  Another detriment to the game was the lighting.  I put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where I was going.  Sometimes that wasn't even bright enough.  There are sections of this game that are absolutely dark, especially towards the end of the game.  While this creates a very scary atmosphere, I felt it hindered the game play once in a while.  The reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with.  You have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas.  Now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something, but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes.  Seriously, the flashlights in real life would NOT die so quickly and then it's up to you to go find another one.  The only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light, you can't enjoy the environment nearly as much.\n\nAside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and I had a lot of fun playing it.  In '98 this came out around the same time as Half Life and they were both the must play FPS games that year.  Half Life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line.  Unfortunately Unreal's story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things.  The user doesn't really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles.  Whereas Half Life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control.  Unreal just couldn't compete with something of that caliber and it's not nearly as engrossing on that level.  Beautiful world and really fun to play overall, but not the best of the year.\n\nOverall Rating: 4.5 out of 5", "summary": "Still a really awesome game to play!", "unixReviewTime": 1225497600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "2", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2006", "reviewerID": "AV8287BM8LJN6", "asin": "B00000DMAM", "reviewerName": "Sam", "reviewText": "The game may be old, but it's still fun as hell.

The gleam I'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play. It tries to be something new, which it is, but it improves in all the wrong ways.\n\nAllow me to explain :\n\nWeapons Inventory. Instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory, you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have. For example, I can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more. The rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like Speed Missiles (more on that in a bit). In previous TM installments, you could keep building your homing missile capacity, and carry only those, as long as you didn't exceed the max capacity. Annoying.\n\nNew Weapons. Okay, so initially I thought the (((Rain Missile))) was the best thing since sliced bread. But really, the rain missile doesn't do very much apart from visual appeal. The missile shoots into the air and you detonate it, and a ring of fire falls down like five mini-napalms. It doesn't do the damage the napalm does, but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire...at least until they turbo (stop-drop-and-roll in TM maneuvers) out of it 2 seconds later. Minimal damage done.\n\nThe introduction of the (((Speed missile))) was the worst mistake of the weapon category. It's a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets. If you can fire them fast, you can do some damage, but they're so useless during combat that it really doesn't even matter.\n\n(((Remotes))) are plenty but do much less damage than in TM2. (((Freeze missiles))) (the left-right-up maneuver) do not hit enemies like they used to. It is much harder to freeze an enemy. This can be frustrating.\n\nEnemies. New characters are added, some are great, some not so great. Your enemies now have the A.I. that allows them to steal items from in front of you. If they need health, they will race you for it and take the health. This is especially frustrating when you are fighting Minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health. *Cue controller hitting floor*\n\nThe levels are not very large. Not much scenery and not much to discover. There's a few hidden places you can find to explore, but for the most part it's very limited.\n\nAll in all, TM3 falls flat.

It had challenging, yet rewarding, levels and overall solid gameplay.  However, it had two marks against it.  The first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the N64 and resembled SuperNES games on certain boards.  The second is that, except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again, \"Shadows...\" lacks any real replay value.  The introduction of \"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron\" (based on a series of very successful novels) to the N64 environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for action/adventure games on ANY platform.\n\n\"Rogue Squadron\" focuses on the missions of the famed Rogue Squadron, thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy.  Led by the legendary Wedge Antilles, the squadron fights 16 regular missions (and 3 bonus missions) ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of Tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of Kessel to battling the terrifying 'World Devastators' on Mon Calamari.  That just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place.  The graphic environment is much more advanced this time around.  No more static matte backgrounds.  Everything is fluid and moves with the player.  The gameplay has also been enhanced.  Greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships.  Overall, it makes for a spectacular gaming experience.\n\n\"Rogue Squadron\" also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability.  It awards medals (bronze, silver, gold) for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency.  Achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions.  This creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met.\n\nThere is only one minor quibble about \"Rogue Squadron\".  In the game designers' quest to make a very demanding game, they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill.  The most glaring example of this is the level 'Raid on Sullust'.  Flying as a (supposedly) heavily armored Y-Wing, one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission.  However, the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the 12-15 targets that must be hit.  With skillful flying, it may be possible to knockout 3 or 4 of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying, but on the life, it's likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than 10 seconds.  With only 3 ships per mission, it's impossible to defeat that mission without using the 'unlimited lives' cheat code (which will NOT be revealed here).  However, there's no shame in using that code, and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals.  So, it's a minor annoyance.\n\n\"Rogue Squadron\" raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for action/adventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet.  Nintendo still gets it, though, as it followed this game with the even more successful \"Rogue Leader\" for GameCube.  \"Rogue Squadron\" is a must have for any serious gamer's library.", "summary": "Quintessential Star Wars game for the N64", "unixReviewTime": 1031788800}, {"overall": 2.0, "vote": "2", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2002", "reviewerID": "A3SF50Z5Q7PJA4", "asin": "B00000DMB2", "reviewerName": "Casey Aytes", "reviewText": "Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat. the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt's palace on Tattoine.\nThe main problem i have with this game is on the Hoth and Deathstar mission.(use password DEADDACK to get to them)on the Hoth mission you wrap a cord around Imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do.

After Shadows of the Empire was released, it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level, where you are flying a Rebel Airspeeder during the Battle of Hoth.  LA decided to make a whole game using a similar concept, and Rogue Squadron was born.  You play as Luke Skywalker, leader of Rogue Squadron, a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy, making life difficult for the Empire and its minions.  You play through 16 basic missions, which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of Rogue Squadron during the time between the destruction of the first Death Star and The Empire Strikes Back.  The missions range from simple search-and-destroy missions, to escorting supply trains, to freeing rebel soldiers from Imperial prison facilities.  Along the way, you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft, from the X-Wing to the Airspeeder.  Each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses, plus each craft has a special weapon, which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions.  After you complete each mission, you may be awarded a bronze, silver, or gold medal based on your performance.  After completing a mission, you can move on to the next one, or else go back and try again to get a better score.  The game gives you a score summary after each mission, so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold.\nThe look and feel of the game is excellent.  The graphics are superb, and the Expansion Pak boosts them to cinematic levels.  The sound is also excellent for a non-CD game, although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive.  The game is contained within a 3D environment, giving the game a flight simulator-like feel.  The controls are pretty easy to get used to, though this DOES take a little practice.  Fortunately, the first couple of missions are pretty easy, so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls.  The controls are the same for each ship, so you don't have to switch back and forth.\nAs stated before, the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy.  But, starting with about the fourth mission, they start to get REALLY tough, with multitudes of TIE fighters, missile turrets, and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down.  Expect to die many times before mastering each mission.  Getting the gold medal on all 16 missions will definitely take a while.\nThe game has a lot of nice bonus features as well.  As you complete missions and earn higher medals, three bonus missions will appear, plus you will gain access to new ships, including the Millenium Falcon and a captured Imperial TIE Interceptor.  There is also a passcode screen, allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options, including a fourth bonus level and the Naboo Starfighter.  There is even a code to allow you to fly a Buick sedan against the Empire!  The codes themselves are pretty easy to get.  There are several sites on the Internet that have them.\nIt's easy to get immersed in the 3D environment of this game.  Many's the time I've found myself leaning over to the left or right as I put my X-Wing through a tight turn.  For those who like flight simulator-type games, I would say that this is the best FS game on the N64.

First, landing your snowboard in this game is more based on luck than skill. First, you have to press the \"Z\" button when you land and secondly you can't move your control stick AT ALL when you are landing or your player is going to fall over because the board is on an angle on screen. That right there ruined the game for me because it sucked a lot of the fun right out of the game. Also, if you want to try to play this game, I recommend plugging in an N64 controller that has a joystick that is still very firm. I started playing with my usually controller, where the joystick is a little loose and I was pretty bad. Plugged in another controller with a firm joystick, got INSTANTLY BETTER controlling my character in the game! Second, if you bump a wall you fall over. There are other snowboarding games on the N64 that do that, but here it seemed really prevalent. Third, the music in this game is really annoying sounding. I liked the title track, but after that I was treated to songs that had people with high pitched or dull voices yelling the same things over and over again! I would have preffered just straight up instrumental music here. Fourth, I noticed that \"PRETTY MUCH\" the only way of winning a race against the computer player, was to take a short cut hidden in each course. Sure you could try to out board them, but if you mess up 2 or 3 times (hit a wall or wall over) FORGET WINNING!!! Fifth, when you enter the competition events, YOU ONLY GET SO MANY CONTINUES and let's say you are playing on easy (Where there are 4 tracks) and you want to quit the 3rd race because you know you are going to lose and don't want to waste a continue. So you go to select \"Restart\" from the pause menu. YOU ARE BACK ON THE FIRST COURSE AND HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING OVER AGAIN!!! AGGH!!! Sixth, I did some of the time attack modes, I believe that's the right name for it. I am not positive right now.) Anyway, you have to board through certain goals (They look like a traditional marathon finish line) and I am playing the one level and the goal was on a cliff above me, that I had no chance of getting on from where I was and time ran out and I lost! WHY WOULD THEY PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE GAME!!! Put the goal lines where people have a good chance of getting to them. Not up on a cliff, that I could of went up on, 8 seconds ago, but now I am stuck!!!\n\nI loved the look of this game! That's why it was so hard for me to let go of the thought of getting fully into this game. I tried very hard to like this game, but I still couldn't bring myself to do that because of the mentioned above flaws.

I've probably played through it at least a dozen times as I just enjoy the story, how it unfolds, the characters you meet and the events that transpire that intertwines their stories together.\n\nPrior to this game, I was mostly into sports/FPS type games. An RPG (heck I didn't even know what that meant at the time) game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that I wanted. A friend of mine where I was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game. Indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it, the more I got interested in it.\n\nThen came release day. I still wasn't sold on it but after leaving work I figured... what the hell. Drove 45 minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at EBGames. Soon as I entered he was like \"Did you preorder this!!\". I told him no and that I wasn't really interested in RPG's as they always sound boring and I'd lose interest quick and waste my money. He showed me a quick demo and I admit, it got me thinking as to \"I wonder what happens after this...\". I finally said sure. He hooked me up with the strategy guide, free tshirt and the 3 disc game... 3 DISCS!! When I cracked open the case and saw 3 discs... I knew this would be an epic, legendary tale. I just didn't know how epic.\n\nI won't go much into the characters as they have been around a long time and most know who/what they are. But the story... wow. I could not have been more hooked. At first it started off a little slow, mostly to get you introduced to the characters and get some backstory going. After the 2nd mako reactor explosion and you get knocked into slums and fall through the church and meet Aeris... it all changes. The direction, tone and emotion starts running higher. Battles get more intense. You really get the feel that something big, much bigger than even all these characters is building up. It all seems to point to Shinra, but even as you infiltrate it, something is even more disturbing. JENOVA. Soon as I saw that short cutscene with Cloud peeking inside its stasis chamber.. my jaw dropped. I wanted to know what it is, where it came from, what they are using it for etc etc etc. But thats what set this game apart. The more answers you get, the more questions were raised than before.\n\nThe world is huge, lots of explorable areas with side quests and storylines. I spent alot of time raising the Chocobos and racing them to get the Gold Choco so I can access the caves that contained important and powerful items and materia.\n\nMateria System: One of the best magic systems I have encountered to date. While you won't use all the materia you buy/find. Its the reward of seeing that glowing green/blue/red/yellow/purple stone that makes you fight to get it and see what it is. Summons are excellent with great animation for the time it was made. Knights of the Round was very long to summon, but the damage and wait is well worth it.\n\nCharacters: Some of the most diverse ever seen and very deep with different backgrounds. I think the first time I really got a sense of how immense this story was getting was when I first went into Shinra Mansion with all the creepy creatures you fight and head into the basement where all the Shinra research was stored regarding JENOVA, Sephiroth and the experiments. The characters sucked you in with their drive and emotion to the situations. Making you want to keep going and see whats around the next corner.\n\nIn conclusion, for us long-timers here this game never gets old. For the newcomers, get ready to experience something extraordinary.

I have over 120+ hours played on my game save.  Final Fantasy VII Platinum Edition features a revamped old soundtrack...that I find 2x better than the PSone version's soundtrack.  Although it takes a while to adjust to the numpad controls, after playing for a while, you'll wonder how you would have done it any other way.  The on-screen controls are bizarre and during scenes such as the timed puzzle in the rocket ship, you'll have a hard time typing in key combos.  Materia allows you to use different magics on different characters, allowing for different characters to use Summons, Magic, and Cure.  My tip: don't give up solely because of the controls---this game is FANTASTIC and although I found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into, the PC version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it.  FF7 is by far the best game I have ever played, and you do not want to miss out on this adventure.  My only tip: don't save over the same file, especially before you enter the Northern Crater--you won't be able to exit it if you do.\n\nReplayability: ***** (Tons of extra caves, quests, missions, mini-games to find, extra materia, weapons, limit-breaks, and bosses to fight well after the game is over.)\n\nGameplay: ***** (Amazing boss fights, you will be on the edge of your seat during battles, incredibly fun)\n\nStory: ***** (The plot twists, the depth in the story, the emotions...its AMAZING)\n\nGraphics: ***** (You can view on a big resolution, better textures and stuff.

Ninety percent of the time, I prefer shooters.  But this one...man, it's so weird, so unique, and so GENIUS through and through, how can you not love it?\n\nHere's the story.  Manny Calavera is a low-level salesman trying to earn an honest commission and make a decent day's pay, but it never seems to work out for him.  His boss is constantly on his back, he's routinely snaked by a competitor, Domino Hurley, and the right sales never come his way.  It's a lousy life to have.\n\nEspecially if you're already dead.\n\nThat's the twist; Manny, and just about everyone else in the game, is dead.  This whole game takes place in the Land of the Dead of Mexican/Aztec folklore, with a strong Art Deco influence, with heavy doses of '30s crime noir thrown in.  Everyone in the game is fashioned to look like the sugar skeletons used in Day of the Dead festivals (called 'calaveras'; get it?).\n\nManny works in the Department of Death, trying to work off his time for his misdeeds when he was alive.  He does that by trying to sell 'travel packages' to the recently deceased, so they can make their four-year journey across the Land of the Dead, until they reach the portal leading to the Land of Eternal Rest.  The quality of life this person lived determines whether they get to use a car, a luxury liner, or the exclusive No. 9 train, which speeds its passengers there in four minutes, instead of the customary four years.\n\nUnfortunately, the kind of lowlifes who keep coming Manny's way only deserve walking sticks at best, which does absolutely nothing to help Manny work off his time.  So, he decides to take matters into his own hands and STEAL the right kind of client.\n\nAnd that's when he gets in over his head.\n\nThe story is pure crime noir with a technicolor twist, like Raymond Chandler meets Tim Burton.  The plot Manny uncovers is convoluted, brilliant, deeply twisted, and diabolical like you've never imagined possible.  It's also incredibly, unspeakably funny.  Tim Schaefer is one absurd individual, make no mistake.\n\nYes, it's an old game, I know.  But the true classics know no age, and this is a classic all right.

Blessen", "reviewText": "Grim Fandango is best described as a detective story in the Film Noir tradition.  The hero of the piece, Manny Calavera, evokes the private eye of the 1940's or '50's melodrama whose story begins with a dame walking  into his office and who quickly finds himself enmeshed in a vast and  corrupt conspiracy which may do him in. The difference here is that at the  beginning of this story, Manny is already dead, and the events transpire in  the Land of the Dead, the place where, according to Mexican folklore,  departed souls go to embark on their journey to the hereafter.\nBlending  Mexican folk mythology with the Film Noir genre, Grim Fandango is  ultimately respectful of both traditions, and the striking art design is in  keeping with this approach, combining Art Deco and pre-Columbian elements.  The dialogue, refreshingly witty and literate, draws the player in to the  characters and the story, as does the varied musical score, which includes  Mexican folk melodies.\nThe characters are for the most part vividly  drawn, and due to the superb performances by the voice talent (particularly  Tony Plana as Manny and Maria Canals as Meche) are fresh despite their  mostly formula roles. One character which may provoke mixed reactions is  that of Glottis, Manny's driver. A cartoonish, Jar Jar Binks-like figure,  Glottis skews the story in a younger direction (at odds with the mild  epithets employed by other characters in a few instances), and while my  children liked Glottis, I expect most players will find him either  endearing or irritating.\nThe interface in this game is unusual. Rather  than pointing and clicking with a mouse, the player controls Manny's  movements with the arrow keys, waiting to see Manny's head turn to an  object he becomes interested in and clicking \"enter\" to see what  happens. This approach takes some getting used to, and can be cumbersome at  times, but it places Manny at the center of the action and increases the  player's identification with Manny, ultimately serving the story.\nThe  puzzles, many of which are multi-step, involve crafting Rube Goldberg  solutions to various problems. Some of the solutions are thoroughly  counterintuitive (I won't give anything away, but let's just say that  objects such as balloons or a crystal paperweight are employed in bizarre  ways), and are best solved through aggressive trial and error.  Clues may  pop up from time to time to expedite this sometimes tedious process.

Somewhat courageously, it does *not* attempt to make its  graphics realistic.  Rather, it searches successfully to use its medium to  best effect.  Like the best films, _Fandango_ manipulates its elements to  produce a world unto itself.  Its first-rate direction and hitherto  unique-to-adventure-games 3D technology  points the way forward for the  adventure games.\nTrue, some of the puzzles are hard, but none of them  really seem out of place.  Indeed, there is with _Grim Fandango_ a true  sense of plot.  Maybe the characters don't develop as they do in novels or  great films, but, thanks to fine vocal talent and crisp writing, they do  maintain charming integrity throughout.\nIf I have a complaint with the  game, it is the interface by which your character, Manny, communicates with  others.  You choose from among several sentence options, like those old  \"choose-an-ending\" books.  It's not a *bad* way to play a game, I  suppose, but just as multiple choice tests are always easier than writing  essays, being able to choose from amongst a few limited options make it  easier to get information out of the rest of the game's cast.  As a  result, solving problems is sometimes dead simple.  Of course, there aren't  many better options for game developers trying to give players a sense of  control of their destinies, but it makes one long for the day when the  promise of a game like _Titanic_, with its limited ability to understand  unique phrases typed in by the player, might be more fully realized.\nSome people, though, might like the fact that they exhaust their  investigations of other characters pretty quickly.  It does speed game  play, and isn't as frustrating as trying to find the right questions on  your own might be.  This *is* a big game, with lots of scenes and lots of  people to meet.  Speed-of-play matters.  So, even if I personally believe  there must be a better way to communicate to other characters, I can hardly  rate the game down for what is possibly the best solution currently  available.\nThus, even if you think you don't like adventure games, you  should still buy _Grim Fandango_.  Likewise, if you don't have time to play  adventure games, you should get a walkthrough and cheat your way to the  end, because the graphics, story, and soundtrack are just that good.  This  is one of the seminal achievements in the genre, and to miss out on it  would be to accept a huge gap in your understanding of where the games  industry might be heading.", "summary": "LucasArts looks to Mexican tradition for adventure's future", "unixReviewTime": 956880000}, {"overall": 1.0, "vote": "4", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2000", "reviewerID": "A3N1V8LIFT0RU6", "asin": "B00000DMAD", "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "reviewText": "the game's okay, although i don't think making the charactersin 3d was a very good idea, plus at some points game gets outrightboring,and all the main characters smoke...  although the game will crash sometimes, and it might get stuck, overall, the game is pretty much okay if you don't count crashes and how the characters act and look...

For starters, your main objective is to find  all the Jiggys on a level so you can gain access to all other levels.

I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago.  Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara's pretty face.  Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin' market.  The thing is, the games are boring and Lara Croft isn't very pretty.\n\nIf polygon-breasted girls are your thing, go for it.  But they aren't MY thing, and I know I'm not the only one to think so.  Lara Croft isn't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe isn't going to automatically make a game any fun to play.  I'll give Lara Croft SOME credit.  She was one of the originators of the \"running around half-naked female shooter/adventure\" type of video games.  In fact, you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure, more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks.  Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that.\n\nSometimes influence doesn't matter when a game is really bad.  This is one of those cases.  The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke.  I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are, the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games, the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft (which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game.  Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to) and of course, mentioned above, Lara's supposed beautiful face (she's NOT pretty, remember?)\n\nIt also doesn't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful (and appear frequently) and, because of the jumping problem, very frustrating to complete.  Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isn't exactly a walk in the park, either.  The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point.\n\nBy the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series.  Now, these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games, but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically*, making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison.\n\nAt least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels.  I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara's pretty face ALONE isn't going to get the job done anymore.  I mean, at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good .  Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course, and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight.  But what's THERE is okay to look at, at least.\n\nTomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem.  She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to.  You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier.  The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it.\n\nBOY am I glad I never bought any of these games (all these years I've been watching OTHER people play them).

I'll admit, I used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game. But can you really blame me?\nThe game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level, in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level, but regardless, you'll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes, and then (surprise!) jumping over another set of spikes, and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go. Don't go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are, it'll be the last dangerous think you look at.\nFinally, after a period of a week to a year, you've finally beat the jungle levels... WITHOUT CHEATS! Well I bet you were quite tempted! Now choose your destination. The strategy guides all tell you to go to the Nevada Desert, and then to the South Pacific, and then London. If you watch the entire \"Story So far...\" feature, you'll notice that the game plays the scenes with South Pacific first and Nevada Desert last. So nobody cares what order you do it in, it doesn't matter much. And believe me; you WILL get frustrated either way, so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you FOREVER to finish that section of levels.\nFinally, after God-knows-how-long, you finished the whole globe, and get this; you did it ALL WITHOUT CHEAT CODES! I congratulate you. NOW WE GET TO GO TO ANTARTICA!!!\nYippee.\nAntarctica is incredibly difficult, and it ends with a big, mumbo-jumbo mother-of-all-spiders human-headed thing. Oh, and one shot with the rocket launcher just won't kill it! And one thing to keep on mind, one-hit K.O. As in, if it hits you once, it will kill you. Good luck!\nBut in spite of all of that, I really enjoyed seeing Lara in new costumes and playing in her new house. It was a lot of fun to get the racetrack key and find the shortcut at the racetrack. I must say, I really did enjoy Tomb Raider 3.\nIf you like challenges, then Tomb Raider 3 is definitely for you. And regardless, the Mansion is definitely worth the 5 dollars that Tomb Raider 3 now cost at Game Crazy. But, if you're anything like me and do not enjoy getting so frustrated over a horribly pixilated British woman in a jungle tomb, then get ready to memorize \"L2, R2, L2(2), R2, L2, R2, L2, R2, L2(4), R2, L2, R2(4), L2\" if you want to beat this game!", "summary": "TOO HARD", "unixReviewTime": 1086998400}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "4", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2002", "reviewerID": "A3JX74J0LE924A", "asin": "B00000DMB4", "style": {"Format:": " CD-ROM"}, "reviewerName": "Lisa Houghtaling", "reviewText": "This is a great game to own I have and I beaten It  ten times and I sill play it the level's are pretty to look at the background's are ok it's colorful and a little rich here and there.\nPlay through five world's there are:\n1 South Pacific\n2 Antarctica\n3 Area 51\n4 London\n5 India\nNew Moves, and Vehicles:\nSpeed Dash, Monkey swing,  kayak and quad bike help Lara out of tricky situations.\nNew weapons like:\n1 Grenade Launcher\n2 Desert Eagle\n3 Rocket Launcher\nIn the game fine the ancient meteor rumored to have life giving power's.

Also if you have something against people and animals,  then you won't be dissappointed either.\nYou also get to blow uo raptors  and a T-rex by the way.

I'm not gonna  compare the two, mind you, but let's say that while TL3 is a really good  game and somewhat long- it's not gonna make a classic or give Mario or  Sonic a run for their money.\nSimply put, all the TR games are long and  filled with adventure. Lara's cute and i like this game but it's just not  gonna be what i'm looking for long-term.\nIt's also tedious to have to  play through it again.

Rare had already made several games for the NES and enters the Nintendo 64 market with this release based on the classic James Bond movie of the same title. You can ask anyone who had a Nintendo 64 if they ever played this game and why it was so popular. You're guaranteed to hear 2 reasons in particular why this game is so revered.\n\nREASON #1: This game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game. It was more than 2 years since the movie it was based on came out and Rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music, likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other James Bond movies such as Oddjob and Mayday. They didn't rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake. This game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamers.\n\nREASON #2: Nintendo had no idea that the multi-player section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode. Rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multi-player mode until later in its development stages. Though it may be limited by today's standards, you had the basics: several stages based on the single player mode, all of the weapons were available, all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic Bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match, team death match, you only live twice (2 lives) etc. and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match. This added a lot of re-playability after you finished the single player mode.\n\nIf you don't have a Nintendo 64, this game is reason enough to get it. This game helped Nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title I highly recommend getting if you can find it.

I still remember that commercial from the late 90s. It told us that a \"dark time is approaching.\" My interest was piqued. Then I realized it was a Zelda game. As a huge fan of A Link to the Past, I thought \"ZOMG that looks awesome! I need to get this more than I've ever needed to get anything!\" I remember reading about it in GamePro and obviously being interested, but that commercial sealed the deal. I knew I had to have Ocarina of Time, and that Christmas, my mom got it for me. Cheers!\n\nA lot has been said about OoT over the years. It has been referred to as the \"Best Game of All Time\" by some, and the \"Most Overrated Game of All Time\" by others. I'm not really in either camp, but I lean closer to the former group, I suppose. If you haven't played it yet, you should. It's out on a variety of platforms and there's even remake of it with better graphics, but I would still recommend the N64 version if you want the same experience people had back in the 90s when OoT was THE GAME you needed to play.\n\nStory:\n\nYou are Link. The Great Deku Tree, guardian of the forest in which you live, has summoned you. It's revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a \"Princess of Destiny,\" and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of Hyrule -- nay, the world -- itself.\n\nGameplay:\n\nTo complete your quest and save Hyrule, you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors, human-sized spiders, horrible ghosts, and... immobile venus fly traps! Completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest, and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss. There's much more to it that, but I'm trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who haven't played it.\n\nHyrule is a vast world. One of your in-game guides tells you that \"You can go wherever you want.\" That's true, to a point. There's a lot of exploration in Ocarina of Time. The game is always trying to point you toward a certain place, but whether or not you go there is often up to you. In an interactive world such as Hyrule, you can do many things. Why go see what's on Death Mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in Hyrule? Or why go play the Shadow Temple -- which does not have any attractive Gerudo women -- when you could go to the Spirit Temple, which does? The exploration is one of OoT's best features, and it's probably better than any Zelda which came after it.\n\nControls:\n\nThey work well enough. You don't have the full on camera control that some of the later Zelda games give you, but personally, I never found it all that essential to the process.\n\nOcarina of Time introduced a \"Z-targeting system\" for aiming at enemies and talking to non-playable characters. What you do is get near an enemy/NPC, press or hold Z, and then press a button to talk to them/attack them. The system pretty intuitive and well made, so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon it.\n\nMusic:\n\n*90s gripe* Where is the classic Zelda overworld theme? Oh, we can hear it for like five seconds in the Hyrule Field theme? ARE YOU SERIOUS? But seriously, the music is pretty good. The Hyrule Field theme which I just mentioned is a good theme. The music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit, for the most part.\n\nSome later Zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons. OoT is guilty of this too, but only to a small degree. Apart from the Water Temple's melody, there's nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it. :P\n\nOh, and I'm sad to report that the \"OoT Commercial Music\" is not in this game... :(\n\nReplay Value:\n\nIt's pretty massive. You can do some Temples in different orders than you did your first time through, or you can use different items to progress through the Temples. I summed it up in a sentence, but there's hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of OoT's possible variations.\n\nLike in the original Legend of Zelda, you can do the \"Three Heart Challenge,\" which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon. Essentially, that's playing Hard Mode (although it isn't really that hard).\n\nBut if the Three Heart Challenge wasn't enough, OoT lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder! There are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat. Not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas. On top of all that, you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damage.\n\n______\n\nIf you call yourself a gamer and have not played Ocarina of Time, what are you?

Berk", "reviewText": "GoldenEye 007 is not only the best movie tie-in game of all time, but it is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter ever to hit the gaming-console market.  If you aren't aware of the plot of this game that's not a problem, because essential it is the same as the popular James Bond movie, GoldenEye, which was released in 1995- two years prior to this game's release.\n\nThis is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come, and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives, and difficult challenges.  The A.I. is smart (especially on higher difficulty settings) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment, as well as difficulty to any gamer.\n\nThe introduction of logical hit-points on your enemies is a great feature.  Even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well-aimed shot to the head.  It is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak in, sneak out, covertly taking out henchmen as you go, or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts.  Because of this there are many ways to beat the game, and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks.  AKA: You can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels...and if you don't have a strategy guide you'll have to find out those paths by yourself (which, I might add, is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away).\n\nThis is one of those games that the more you play it the more you're able to value its contributions to the gaming industry.  Each time I play it I notice aspects that have been replicated in many following FPS games.  So if you have a Nintendo 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because trust me, as a Bond fan, and a casual gamer I can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of James Bond, or just have an awesome, intense gaming experience.\n\n(Also make sure to look out for its sister game, Perfect Dark, which is also on the N64, following the same controls, and very similar weapon uses.)", "summary": "One of the best, most innovative shooters of all time; A Must Have!", "unixReviewTime": 1238371200}, {"overall": 2.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2013", "reviewerID": "A2582KMXLK2P06", "asin": "B00000DMB3", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Bryan", "reviewText": "Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it's hard to believe I'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series.\n\nOne thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don't tell me Nintendo wasn't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that's it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too.\n\nThe dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I'm really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that's apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust.\n\nWhile normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game.\n\nLet's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness.\n\nThe storytelling is really basic and predictable. It's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron's for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn't even feel or look like you're going 7 years into the future as Link's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn't appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it's very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there.\n\nThe dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic \"I'm stuck in a maze and I can't get out\" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren't any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda's so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration.\n\nThe enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your \"adventure\" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It's all about atmosphere. It's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo's most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn't stood the test of time.\n\nDo you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64's limitations as a console that it's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you're running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you're stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies.\n\nThe game overall has a shortage of rupees. They're really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don't feel like collecting them, then don't- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you're wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it's really fun and creative. The hookshot's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it's annoying that it's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot.\n\nIf you haven't noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It's overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I've ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence.\n\nGanon's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It's really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie.\n\nA few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting.\n\nBasically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die.\n\nReading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn't get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon's presented uninterestingly. You're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn't ever materialize (at least, he's not as scary as he *should* be).\n\nRecognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!", "summary": "a 2-star rating- I seriously can't give it a higher star", "unixReviewTime": 1374796800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2013", "reviewerID": "A36QIF5IIJ5EJX", "asin": "B00000DMB3", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "K_Renny", "reviewText": "One of the best games of all time.\nYou get the thrill of beating all the bosses, playing the ocarina, and riding Epona around Hyrule.

You'd think the developers of the original would come up with some innovative game play for the sequel. While maybe they can, they didn't here. Not only is the game play unchanged, it suffers from a weak story, poor balancing and computer AI and several small problems.\n\nThe single player campaign story, what there is of it, is just a jumble of scenarios without much to tie them together. There are characters and things happen to them but but there isn't a story progression to follow. You fight over here, you fight over there, then it's the final battle. In fact I reached the end of the GDI campaign without realizing it. The live video cut-scenes should have helped create a rich back-story but writing this I can't remember any of it.\n\nThere are balance issues particularly with NOD units and structures. A NOD 'super laser' structure can destroy almost anything with one shot but the NOD artillery is completely unbalanced. With a long range and a big punch, the artillery is can wipe out any ground force, and is unstoppable even in small numbers as long as a small anti-air backup is nearby.\n\nThe computer is an easy opponent. It doesn't rush but sending units at piecemeal, a handful at a time. It doesn't protect it's harvesters either, once you locate them it's easy to cut-off the computer's resources. The computer showed some initiative just once: During a NOD scenario several GDI engineers rushed my base taking several of my structures. I was so surprised it nearly wiped me out but building a good perimeter stopped later rushes. In the scenarios that followed the engineer rush never happened again. I didn't try any higher difficulty levels, maybe the computer plays better there.\n\nLarge maps are hard to manage, the game tell you that an offscreen unit is lost but not where the unit is. Some scenarios seem designed to simply frustrate you with a huge map and a timed objective with no direction as to where to accomplish it. In the end the game is all about the mass rush, once you build 50 or medium strength units nothing the computer can't stop you.

If you shoot someone in the leg, they'll hold onto their leg, same with the arm, the head, and even the groin.  Before this game, the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when they'd die.\n\nStill maim-ability doesn't mean that when you shoot them in the leg they won't be able to run again.  They'll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new, except take a lot less shots to kill.\n\nSome of the tougher characters take a lot of hits before they're even to the point of getting to maim-ability.  You have to shoot the boss of the game 10 times in the head before he even shows signs of weakening.\n\nThe second thing I like about this game is the spy feel of it.  You go on missions, and you work with gadgets (although some are indeed lame).  But the cool thing is, on some missions, you've got to be really quiet and sneaky.  You sneak down halls and pick off unsuspecting guards one by one with well-aimed shots.  Of course, if you get bored of that, you can always make a lot of noise, have a bunch of guards come after you, and blow everyone away.\n\nThis game is pretty realistic.

Unforunately the game didn't seem to live up to the hype but looking back today a few years later tiberian has stood the test as a fine solid game and now that it is basically at a bargain bin price i certainly think it's worth a look even for those who already own red alert 2. The main difference that i see between TS and RA2 is the look. Where the characters in RA2 are a bit too large the ones in TS may be a bit too small. RA2 has a more straight forward look much like ra1 were Ts has that cool golden dusk look. Since TS is a fantasy sci fi game almost anything goes where RA2 is based on more conventional warfare. That extra room for creative activity helps make TS a fun game. One example is the hunter seeker feature were you can create a drone attached to an explosive. This drone will take off on it's own and randomly attach itself and destroy an enemy unit or structure. You must have this feature because your opponent will. Another feature i like is the component towers were you make the towers early and later buy the defensive attachment. There's a vulcan cannon for fighting infantry, the grenade launcher and the anti air sam.\nThe concept for TS is the good guys, global defense initiative(GDI) vs the religious brotherhood of the nod, a fanatical terrorist group. Sounds familiar? Certainly a concept appropriate for today but the NOD is the military equal to the GDI. Both sides are distinctive and different. The GDI is more muscular and has more fire power while the nod relies on stealth and sneaky tactics. Strategy is far more important here than just cranking out more tanks than your opponent. For example the nod has an apc that can burrow under ground. Pack the thing full of infantry or engineers and sneak into the middle of an opponents camp underground only to resurface unleashing the attack. The gdi has ways to counter this however. A mobile sensor can be built that will detect the apc on radar and concrete can be placed down so the unit can't resurface in vulnerable areas of your camp. Some \"new\" features that differ from the original C&C and RA. A single engineer can take over an opponents building, infantry can't just be run over by vehicles and you have the deployable mcv feature that allows you to pack up your command center and move it.\nSome other pros-\nBeing a 1999 game it doesn't require much computer.\nAlmost always runs smoothly.\nStill a fairly vibrant online community with plenty of opponents to play.\nCheap! Only $... or $... if you also want the firestorm pack.\nVery colorful and pleasant to look at. Graphics still look good compared to games that were released a couple of years later.\nA 10 minute patch update that can be downloaded from the game.\nA seemingly unlimited number of free mods that can be dowloaded off the internet.\nThe opportunity to make expensive powerful units like the mammoth tank.\nThere are a few negatives about the game. No naval units at all even though you have these really cool looking rivers. And a limited air force. Orca helicopters are pretty cool but that's it. Most mods are too extreme and change the game too much and there are very few maps you can download. No coop play.\nOver all this is a fun game with the opportunity to change through mods. The graphics are cool and strategy is more important than with the prior C&C releases.

While its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like Gold feathers, Red feathers and Eggs.

The game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game, Banjo Tooie. The levels all relatively easy, however it is very easy to die in this game, on top of that like other reviewers on Amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true. Clarkers Cavern was the worst because you only have 6 things of air and have to get extra air, from a fish blowing bubbles. The level that is the most challenging of them all was Click Clock Wood. Because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me. However the most challenging and difficult part of this game, is beating Grunty herself. That is the most challenging part of this game. because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on Rare's part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game.

It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play so the game feels like a big misleading tease.  All the attention on humor and yet, the game itself is hardly ever fun.  This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor, which I'm sure was Nintendo's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they wouldn't be able to detect the lousy game design.  I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything and everything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we're forced to persevere, so that explains Banjo-Kazooie's existence.\n\nAnyway, Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90% of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time.  The waters, grassy lands, mountains... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments.  Probably on par with Donkey Kong 64 in terms of graphics but definitely NOT in terms of gameplay or the sheer size of the overworld which is incredibly tiny in Banjo-Kazooie.  But seriously, why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time?  If you think \"That's what ALL platformers do!\" guess again: many of them focus on exciting enemy variety, diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks.  The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges.  I found sharks you have to swim away from, crabs you can stomp on top of, and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you're trying to make your way across high paths without falling.  These enemies only appear like 10% of the time- the rest of your surroundings aren't very threatening.\n\nLet's see all the things you have to collect.  Honeycomb pieces, jiggy pieces (mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world), 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star, mumbo tokens used to cast spells, and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts.  You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity, but otherwise nothing to get really excited about.  Often you have to climb trees or mountains to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while, believe me.  The snowy and dessert areas are incredibly generic too, as are the underwater cave sections and grasslands.\n\nOh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it's much harder than it needs to be.  I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming.  It's mind-boggling.  They didn't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2, a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie.  The characters are all forgettable, including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself.  Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch.\n\nWhereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively, Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group.  It's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers.  Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself \"Is it worth my time to return here again?\"", "summary": "banjo kapooie", "unixReviewTime": 1376265600}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2013", "reviewerID": "AJPTIO3SH82S7", "asin": "B00000DMAQ", "reviewerName": "brutusmuktuk", "reviewText": "Developer Rare is a master at infusing originality into their imitations. This isn't a knock against them. William Shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces. Rare is gamedom's Shakespeare, in that regard. Banjo-Kazooie is obviously influenced by Super Mario 64, although it's always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece. While Banjo-Kazooie lacks Super Mario 64's magic and ingenuity, it has its own magic that sets it apart from Nintendo's behemoth.\n\nThe Good:\n+ A fun story\n+ An imaginative use of its characters\n+ Creative worlds to explore\n\nThe Bad:\n-- Too easy and short\n-- The few parts that are too hard\n\nThe Ugly\n? Why is Kazooie so insulting?\n\nStory--9/10\n\nThe first thing that stands out is the dialogue, especially of the evil witch, Gruntilda, or Grunty, who speaks in clever rhymes. It's refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny. The game begins with her asking her mirror, \"Who is the most beautiful of them all?\" Of course, it couldn't be Gruntilda. There's nothing even remotely pretty about a fat, green hag. The most beautiful of them all is Banjo's younger sister, Tooty (who looks similar to Tiny Kong of Donkey Kong fame). So Grunty sets off to kidnap Tooty and succeeds, leaving only the mole, Bottles, as a witness. Bottles must survive a downpour of Kazooie's insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to Banjo and Kazooie. The question becomes, can Banjo and Kazooie save Tooty before Grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herself?\n\nGameplay--8/10\n\nHere is the game's bane and boon. Everything else sets it up wonderfully. The soundtrack is great, the visuals are very nice, and the opening story sequence is funny. The game controls smoothly and you have plenty of moves to learn and use throughout. The levels are varied, with plenty of collectibles and other goodies to discover. But these levels are so small, so short, so easy. I never spent an hour and a half on any one level, and most of them took less than an hour to complete. In that time, I could collect ten jigsaw puzzle pieces, one hundred musical notes, and numerous other items such as the Mumbo Jumbo skulls, extra lives, and Jinjos. Compared to Super Mario 64, I can't help but say, is that all?\n\nThere are a total of nine worlds, as well as a main hub world, which is too labyrinthine for its purpose. Rare goes a little overboard as to the amount of collectibles they expect gamers to gather. Unless you use cheats, it takes 94 out of the 100 Jigsaw pieces total to unlock every single world, including the final fight with Grunty. That's not too difficult, as I'd say about 97 of those Jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake. More than 880 of the 900 music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with Grunty (you just can't count on Rare to make a strictly children's game: see Diddy Kong Racing).\n\nThese are mostly criticisms, but they comprise a small percent of the game. You will spend most of it enjoyably. Despite the very easy difficulty, it isn't boring. There's plenty to explore in the levels, and as they go on, they become larger and more complex, especially the sprawling final level. Rare flexes all of its creative muscles in that level, revolving around the four seasons, and even includes a few semi-stories with some new characters. Not that the other levels are clunkers, but if only they could provide the same sort of entertainment, the rest of the game would have been that much more enjoyable.\n\nLongevity--5/10\n\nA game should only be as long as it needs to be, but I think Banjo-Kazooie needed to be a little longer. Considering what Nintendo did years earlier in Super Mario 64, it's no excuse that Rare couldn't match that level of magnitude. But it's unfair to compare any game to Super Mario 64.

TS is set in  a futuristic world with advanced units. Red Alert was a PREQUEL to the  original C&C and was set throughout the Cold War. TS does not use  standard tanks and the new units were made as it would have been seen in  the year TS took place which was 2030. This is especially true with GDI and  there titans, disruptors, firestrom defense, rpg towers, MMK II and a whole  lot more.

Westwood retained a couple of units from the original C&C such as the  devil's tougue and light tank but they upgraded the functions of these  units to please gamers. Nothing from this game was copied from RA- trust  me. As for Starcraft some say its better than TS and some say it isnt. I  personally hate that game. Its way more complex to understand than TS  simple interface, no deformidable terrain, you have to RIGHT CLICK to  deselect units (very awkward), structures take extremely long to build - as  well as units, those same structures look like they have legs(terran  barracks and engineering bay).

Banjo Kazooie was released in 1998 and has been considered a classic since, and I too must agree with this well deserved honor. Well, why do I find this game fantastic? Well, I'll explain that in my review.\n\nFirst off let's talk about Banjo Kazooie's story. Banjo's sister Tooty is kidnapped by the wicked witch Gruntilda. Gruntilda has planned on swapping Tooty's beauty to her, but not if Banjo and his friend Kazooie can help it! Okay, seriously this story is pretty lame, but hey! It's a game. In My opinion, no matter how good the graphics are, or how great the story is, it all boils down to one thing. And that's gameplay. And Banjo Kazooie has fantastic gameplay.\n\nIn Banjo Kazooie you play as Banjo and...well...Kazooie, and Kazooie stays inside Banjo's backpack at all times, but she's not useless. They both work as a team and learn many moves, which brings us to our next character, Bottles. Bottles the mole helps you learn different moves to help you defeat Gruntilda and rescue Tooty. But do you just walk up to Gruntilda and save Tooty? Not at all, there are several items to collect to defeat Gruntilda. The most important one is jiggies, there are ten jiggies in each world and you need several items to collect them. Along the way Bottles teaches you to use certain items, such as eggs to shoot through Kazooie's mouth, or how to fly when you collect enough feathers. Another essential item to collect is mumbo tokens. Gruntilda has hidden mumbo tokens all around her enormous lair and if you collect enough you can visit the great shaman Mumbo Jumbo and he will transform you into different creatures to help you along your journey. So you have plenty to do in this game, I can guarantee that. Another essential item are music notes, in each world one hundred music notes are scattered all around and if you collect enough you can open new doors in Gruntilda's massive lair. But I do find it to become quite tedious sometimes. Why? You may ask. Because each time you leave and re-enter a world all the notes are still there, no matter how many you've collected. Let's say you've collected ninety-nine out of the hundred possible music notes to collect, well if you leave the world and re-enter, you would have to collect all ninety nine notes again, you couldn't go searching for the one music note you hadn't collected. And while yet this situation is highly unlikely, it's still annoying no matter how many notes you have to re-collect. Fortunately, if you don't care about collecting all one hundred music notes, you don't have to because the game automatically saves the amount you've collected.\n\nThere aren't too many moves to learn in Banjo Kazooie, and it didn't take me long to master them. And there aren't many control problems, actually the controls are almost perfect. But I did get frustrated with a feature that was not added in the game, I wish Banjo could hang on to ledges, there was many times in Clanker's Cavern where I could almost reach a ledge,  but it was just barely out of reach because I couldn't hang on to the ledge. While yet this wasn't too big of a deal, I think that feature could of made the game a little less frustrating. I was also very pleased with camera control, there are three angles to choose from except in a few rare areas and I found it easy to maneuver.\n\nI told you this game was made in 1998, right? Well the graphics are terrific. The different atmospheres to this game make it twice more enjoyable. You can relax in broad daylight in Treasure Trove Cove, or wonder at dark in Mad Monster Mansion. And I thought the last world Click Clock Wood was absolutely brilliant, it's a forest and you collect jiggies in the four season's spring, summer, fall and winter. I especially loved Freezeezy Peak, and it was so much fun climbing the huge snowman.\n\nI also loved the music in this game, each beat is catchy and it never got repetitive for me, and the sound effects were great as well...well the only complaint I could have is that there is no dialogue in the game, but I actually found the weird sounds from the characters kind of funny and I loved the insults between Kazooie and Bottles and Gruntilda's rhymes cracked me up, that's another reason I love this game, it has such a charm to it, not like some newer games, to many games have steered away from being innocent and charming, and this game has this quality.\n\nWhat more can I say? This game is fun to play, it has great replay value, the music, sounds and the worlds all sound and look absolutely fantastic and the difficult final fight with Gruntilda at the end was indeed terrific as well. It took me thirty hours to complete (without a guide) and I had so much fun solving puzzles and this game can test your mind at certain times. I will admit I did need help online for a few jiggies, but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile, very satisfying if you ask me. I'm now very anxious to play Banjo Tooie, as it's been claimed to be even better than the original.

But when a revolution comes, what's the point of it being so revolutionary unless something comes of it later on? In video games, a game is a revolution indeed when other games take the basic model and take it to a whole new level, and possibly delivering a game that's even better than the root. Whether it really is a beneficiary of the beloved Mario 64 or Rare is just really, really good at making games, that is where we find Banjo-Kazooie.\n\nGames of the platforming genre aren't exactly known for their amazing stories, and Banjo fares no different. Banjo's little sister Tooty is kidnapped by the stereotypical green witch Gruntilda. She has some sort of weird machine that will supposedly transfer Tooty's beauty to herself, and this will leave Banjo's poor sister ugly in the process! So Banjo and his grumpy bird friend Kazooie (who for some reason lives in Banjo's backpack) set out to Gruntilda's lair to save Tooty. The story doesn't take itself very seriously at all but there's a great, humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depth.\n\nThe game doesn't move from place to place at all; the whole thing takes place in Gruntilda's huge lair, key word being 'huge.' This one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game. There is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair, with a sewer, swamp, graveyard, and many other spots. The areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the game's nine worlds, which are all big, diverse, and have a lot of stuff to find. You'll find yourself at a mountain to begin the game, then moving on to a beach, and later a snow area and haunted mansion-like world, and so on. The game never really runs out of new material to throw at you, which is really nice, even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre, too.\n\nAnother way Banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn. In most of the levels you can find a mole named Bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him. These moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on, and they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically. You have to unlock some of these abilities, such as flight and invincibility, to get deeper into Gruntilda's lair, and also to accomplish more in the worlds. The game controls very well too, even with all the added moves, and it doesn't get too complicated. One issue though is with the camera, which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes can't get the viewpoint that's just right for a room or area.\n\nBut the core of the game stays the same, no matter how many moves you learn or different worlds you visit. The main objects to collect are jiggies, which are basically pieces of jigsaw puzzles that, when put together, open the door to a new world. Ten of these can be found in each level along with 100 notes, which open up doors to new areas of the lair. Unfortunately the game's note total is merely a combined high score of how many notes you collect in each level; each time you re-enter a world the note count restarts. This is pretty annoying sometimes, and it would have been nice to just keep all the notes so you don't have to recollect all of them again to advance your total note count. Thankfully the jiggies are extremely well-balanced as far as how hard they are to get; in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like Easter eggs, but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worlds.\n\nGraphically Banjo kept up to date well enough. The visuals are just a tad choppy, but they still look good enough, and that sort of thing happened all the time in the N64 era. Sometimes objects that are a little ways away won't appear on screen until you get closer, which thankfully doesn't prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed. Despite these few flaws, though, the graphics look great considering the times.\n\nOne of Banjo's shining areas aside from gameplay is the sound. The characters speak in a gibberish sort of language (with text shown on the bottom of the screen) and this might annoy some but it's still good to add personality to each character. The sound effects are all good too, no complaints there. The really cool part of the sound, though, is the music. The tracks are cool enough as they are, but when you're standing on a different spot or in a different area, like if you're under water or at the entrance to a different world, the music style and sound totally changes while keeping the same song. Then as you exit the spot the music transitions back to the normal style, and this effect may sound small without actually hearing it but trust me when I say it's really, really cool.\n\nMario 64 may have been the revolution, but some of the games that derived bits and pieces from it were possibly even better, in my opinion. Banjo-Kazooie is one such game, adding a lot of depth and value to an already proven formula. It may not be the game everyone looked to for inspiration in the game-making world, but Banjo-Kazooie is a real gem from Rare's glory days on the N64, and it makes me want to play the sequel even if it is ten years old.\n\nGameplay: 9.5\nGraphics: 8.5\nSound: 9.5\nCamera & Control: 8.5\nValue: 9.5\n\nFINAL SCORE: 9.2/10", "summary": "Banjo-Kazooie didn't revolutionize the platformer, but it reminds us of why we like the genre so much in the first place", "unixReviewTime": 1233964800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2007", "reviewerID": "A1CDNTB7377YH2", "asin": "B00000DMAQ", "reviewerName": "Michael A.

Banjo's lazy bum the whole time was sleeping. It's up to you to get jiggy's and notes and what-not to stop Grunty and get Banjo's sister back.\n\nGraphics: 9.5/10. Awesomely different and creative worlds. From a sewer, to a pirate ship on an island, to a desert and into an icy snowland, there are tons of different and unique worlds to play through. The graphics are stellar for the N64, with bright colors and cool characters with good animations. This is one of the best N64 games as far as graphics go next to games like Donkey Kong 64 and Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask.\n\nSound: 9/10. There aren't really any voices in this game; just kind of sound effects that are different for each character. Blubber on Treasure Grove Cove sounds like he's burping or throwing up, Kazooie sounds like a gagging bird, Banjo sounds like a big old hick of a bear... and so on. The music in this game, though, is some of the catchiest and the best music i've heard in really any adventure game. The music doesn't really get old, and whoever created it is brilliant. Overall, the sound is really, really good.\n\nControl: 8.5/10. Being an adventure game, there are a lot of different controls for a lot of different moves. And since the N64 controller is the way it is ( pretty annoying ) it's easy to get confused even after playing for hours on end, just because you go brain dead. The controls are a bit strange at first to do some of the attacks, but you will get used to them anyways.\n\nFun: 9/10. A great game from beginning to end. Get the jiggys, move on. Get the notes, move on. That simple? No. This game is challenging and is for all ages, even if it does have a kiddy approach. The game lasts maybe 40 hours or so depending on how fast you get through the game. Great characters, great level design, and fantastic music makes this a must buy. This is one of the best games on the N64, and I.M.O., the best adventure game. Pick this game up now; it is better than its sequel and the Game Boy Advanced ones, even if all three are fantastic.

Rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game, you learn a few in the very beginning, and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds (there are nine, but they are much larger than the fifteen in Mario 64). Notes are like coins, and jiggies are like stars. However, rather than six stars in each world, there are 10 jiggies to find in each world, and 10 in the witch's castle (much like the castle secret stars). Also, you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor Mumbo-Jumbo. Generally, it will help you get at least 1 Jiggy in the world, and they can do things that Banjo and Kazooie can't on their own.

While developed early in N64's lifespan, the graphics stand out beyond many titles recently released. The sound is equally as impressive (for N64), and the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed, depending on your situation.\nI am proud to say many people love this game. Many of my friends still play it occasionally, however few have beaten it all the way. This game is solid for 50+ hours of gaming, but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece and musical note, and every other item. Some people dislike it, and do not be fooled; a 27 year male old who listens to ultra-hard rock and loves games with extreme violence and/or nudity will NOT like this game. It is by no means for everybody. Many gamers, from preschool to high school will like it, but not everybody.\nThe controls are easy enough to master, and any avid or casual gamer will easily master them with a little practice. The sound is superb. The graphics are good, for an N64 title. There is not a dull moment in this game, and the attention to detail is amazing. The puzzles, the meat of the game, are easy enough for older kids to have a challenge and not to hard for younger kids. The puzzle peices, your reward for completeing a puzzle, are well hidden. The musical notes, the only way to advance to the next portion of the overworld, are challenging to find. The most fun part of the game, visiting Mumbo, is quite enjoyable. He transforms you into various forms. A fat walrus, a termite, and even a bumble bee. There isn't really an advancing story, but that's okay. You get an occasional cinematic, but it's pretty basic.\nThe story goes...\nThe evil witch, Gruntilda, is happily hanging out atop her mountain WHEN...

I cannot even think or read about it without getting giddy.  Another Zelda game just came out-- Skyward Sword-- and reviewers have been raving about its story and art work and graphics, etc, etc, etc. But it still doesn't compare to Ocarina of Time. Not even close. I have played many, many games, and there is no question, this is still the best game ever.  No one here is lying.  It deserves every one of those endless 5-stars. There is a massive chasm separating this game from every other game fighting for second place. No other game even comes close.\nWhy? In order of importance, least to greatest:\n1) Graphics.  With consoles now like the 360 sporting games like Halo: Reach, and the PS3 with the Uncharted series, there is some serious competition for artwork and graphics.  But the Ocarina is still more mesmerizing.  Yes, the landscape does not extend forever into the distance, and yes, the polygons making up the characters are obvious, but the lines created are more pleasing than any Zelda since, and the colors blend and contrast perfectly.  From Mount Doom to lake Hylia, the imaginary world and its inhabitants draw you in, and within a few deceptively short hours, you cannot look away. \"Graphics,\" as thought of today, with rocks crumbling and wood splintering when bullets strike, do not exist.  But they don't need to.  Even the most obbsessed lover of graphics will forget their obsession as they get lost in this games beautiful, open world.  If you love the huge open maps of Fable 2, or the sprawling cities of Assassin's Creed, you will love this.\n2) Controls.  Games these days usually let you customize your button layout. This is not nescesarry with Ocarina of Time.  The N64 controller fits any hand perfectly, and the buttons you want are always right where you want them to be.  It is very easy to learn and (except for its sibling Majora's Mask), easier to use than any other game. No crazy button combos to memorize.  No wiggling of the joystick to perform random tasks.  Just simple, logical, purposeful, buttons.  Perhaps in the future it will change, but even after Skyward Sword, I, and many other people still prefer the buttons to the Wii mote. If you like playing Super Smash Brothers Brawl with a gamecube controller rather than the nunchuck, you will definetly prefer this. And unlike Mario64, the cammera follows you perfectly.\n3) Puzzles.  This is not a sword hacking game, though there is enough to satisfy the first person shooters.  There are many very simple puzzles, and many frustratingly hard puzzles, but none so hard that you rip out the cartridge and throw it against the wall. And if you ever get stumped, there are plenty of side quests and mini games to help you upgrade your equipment or simply vent. The game takes time to figure out, even if that means just getting your bearings in a huge maze, but there is a simple satisfaction to moving on, especially when you restart and pass effortlessly through the dungeons you've already decrypted straight to the boss. If you liked Myst, you will love this game.\n4)Story.  Most importantly story.  The first time I read the Narnia series, I was almost bored by its simplicity until the Last Battle, at which time I finally started to recognize the symbolism and see the depth between the lines.  The Ocarina of Time is likewise a simple story, but there is so much depth in the admittedly simple dialogue.  From the opening flames, to the closing courtyard, the game draws you in.  You become a part of Zelda's world.  You come to trust, love, despise, or hate almost every character in the game.  Even the chickens and dogs.  There is a great romance between Zelda and Link, hiding just beneath the surface.  Anything else? You want it, this game has it. Tension. Passion. Action. Adventure. Mystery. Comedy. Heroism. Deceit. Sacrifice.  Even ghosts, mummies, and various undead for all you horror fans.  By the time you finish the game, you have made real connections, for better or worse, with every character in the game.  And (spoiler alert) when Zelda turns and see's young Link walking up behind her in her garden, it is so maddeningly bittersweet you don't know whether to smile or break down and cry.  There is a certain Pale Rider feel, as you see everyone you've helped rejoicing at their freedom from the evil King Gannondorf, and yet knowing that your's is not the happily ever after you spent 7 years fighting for.  It is emotionally beautiful.  The perfect echo to the human heart.\nI cannot stress how highly I reccomend this game.  It is 2012, and it is still listed as the greatest game of all time on every major site.  On Amazon, a new copy is currently selling for $700. It is far and away the best game ever made.  It is the best reason there is to still buy an N64.  If you still do not have this game, buy one now.  Even if you are part of the 0.01% who decides against it, you will easily make all your money back at resale.  But honestly, you will never sell it.  It will grow old on your shelf with honor and dignity as long as the silicone inside it lasts. And maybe even a bit thereafter.", "summary": "Still best game EVER after more than 13 years.", "unixReviewTime": 1330560000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2011", "reviewerID": "A3PRDWD3JMF485", "asin": "B00000DMB3", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Triforce Of Power", "reviewText": "This is, to me, not only the greatest Zelda game in the series, but also the greatest game I've ever play.\n\nWhere to begin? There is so much in this game that makes it so fun. I absolutely love the side quests. Getting the Biggoron Sword is a race against time, but very rewarding considering you will posess an awesome huge sword that is twice as powerful as the Master Sword!\n\nAnother side quest I loved was completing the Gerudo Training Fortress to get the Ice arrows. This will force you to use all your skills and items, and will really put you to the test. I would even venture to say that the Gerudo training temple is more difficult than almost every other dungeon.\n\nThe ghost hunting side quest is very tough and takes practice and patience. Capture all 10 big poes roaming the field of hyrule and sell them to the strange ghost shop. You will get the 4th bottle (the hardest to get)\n\nEven the mask salesman side quest is very interesting and unique. While many wouldn't bother to complete it, but the reward is the very cool and mysterious \"Mask of Truth\". Furthermore, this side quest is slightly more significant considering that the masks are the focal point in the follow up \"Majoras' Mask\".\n\nBut of course, my favorite side quest is the Skulltula side quest. It is very long and trying, but definitely worth it. This is another side quest many people wouldn't bother to complete, but completing it does have it's merits. For example: there is a very profitable rewards system in play. Destroy 10 Golden Skulltulas, and you get the adult wallet (holds 200 rupees). At 20, you get the stone of agony, which (when playing with a rumble pack inserted) will alert the player when a secret is nearby. At 30, get the Giant's Wallet and you can carry 500 rupees. At 40 you get Bombchus (I know, lame). At 50, get a piece of heart. After that, you get nothing more unless you manage to destroy all 100 golden skultullas. Doing this will result in you being able to get 200 rupees every time you visit the house of skultulla. Unlimited money is very cool, although a bit useless at that late a stage in the game.\n\nThe bosses are great. I won't go into great detail, but I've always loved the fight with Volvagia the lava dragon. There is something so classic and satisfying about watching Link defeat a lava dragon in a volcano with the master sword and hylian shield. Also, the final battle with Gannondorf is a real treat, and I never get tired of firing the magic arrows of light at him. The fight has a very epic quality to it, and the final battle against the horribly mutated Gannon has a nightmarish ambience to it.\n\nThe temples all have thier own awesome themes, both musically and environmentally. I always thought that the Forest Temple was incredibly imaginative and just stunning. It has the feel of something abandoned to the wild with overgrown vines overtaking the temple, and the open courtyard.\n\nThe music is top-notch even by today's standards. Koji Kondo really put together a masterpiece.\n\nThere is even a sweet element of sadness in Link's lost childhood, with the loss of his friendship to Saria. The moments where Shiek teaches you a song to warp to a temple always has a reference to a long lost friendship or the somewhat cruel passage of time.\n\nThe ability to customize adult Link's appearance is pretty unique and cool where you can choose with color tunic he wears, which sword and shield to wield.\n\nIn short, this is a wonderful game that will always have a special place in my heart.", "summary": "Link's Greatest Adventure", "unixReviewTime": 1320278400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2015", "reviewerID": "ANAYTP154YH5B", "asin": "B00000DMAX", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Pen Name", "reviewText": "Great game", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1426032000}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2015", "reviewerID": "A2VW5PSQRM2AVK", "asin": "B00000DMAX", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "John DiLoreto", "reviewText": "I must admit: This game hasn't aged too well; the N64 was well known for having the cleanest looking polygons.

Fann", "reviewText": "Zelda OCT is an action-adventure RPG (there is debate about this, and some argue Zelda is it's own genre) with a combination of puzzles, fighting, and racing. Anyone who enjoys this genre will be enthralled by OCT (which you can play on several Nintendo platforms including the 64 and Gamecube). I still play Zelda OCT 10+ years later on the Gamecube from time to time, it's that good of a game.\n\nGraphics:\nFor the time period, Zelda OCT on the 64 was beautiful and it has stood the test of time FAR better than other older games on consoles. It was the first truly 3D game for a console and set the standard for what video games should look like. If you grew up on newer systems and PC's, these graphics will look \"blocky\" to you, but the Gamecube has an OCT version with more refined graphics. Still, if you want a \"retro\" video game experience, the N64 Zelda OCT has graphics that are still enjoyable today.\n\nStory:\nThe Zelda story is perfect for a video game, as the basic premise is always the same. Link, a young boy (or young man in newer games), is the reincarnated hero of time. He must battle the evil Ganon/Ganondorf to save Hyrule and princess Zelda by using the power of the Triforce.\n\nZelda OCT molds the \"Zelda Story\" into a fantastic tale that will take a least a few months to beat for your first time. The game's puzzles become progressively more difficult, culminating in the notoriously challenging dungeon - the Water Temple. The story combines several races (Hylians, Kokiri, Gerudo, Gorons, and Zora) seamlessly into one large kingdom. The enemies are varied and interesting as well. The Fantasy-Adventure story line is complex and intricate, complete with twists and shocks, time-travel, and genocide. Time affects the characters, and you see that not everyone loses when evil prevails. The story details are amazingly deep, to the point that pictures on someone's wall and the clothes they wear can fill in some back story of that character. I loved the detail and enjoyed filling in little pieces of the \"back story\" by talking to the NPCs and looking through the first person scope at their tattoos and clothes. The main story is also amazing, with the typical epic sword-clashing adventure ingeniously employed in the Zelda OCT universe. It's truly a master's greatest work.\n\nGame Play:\nThe 64 had a simple controller for fun game play. There are only a few buttons, A, B, Z, C-pad, R1, L1, joystick, and the D-pad. The D-pad isn't needed in Zelda 64. This limited key selection was used to build an elegant fighting system around a few button combinations. Although B always attacks and A always does \"an action\", the genius of this system falls in the types of attacks you can do. Depending on the way your character is moving, and whether or not an item is targeted, Link can perform an impressive list of sword attacks (vertical cut, horizontal slash, diagonal slash, spin attack, thrust, and jump attacks). Despite the fact that B, Z, and the joystick are the only buttons that control these moves, Link is easy to control and I never had problems getting Link to perform the combination of moves I desired. Link could cut any sign into 5 unique pieces consistently - that is excellent controller response!\n\nIn addition to the perfect synchronization of Link to the game controls (something newer games like Dark Souls could take a lesson on) the game play is interesting and varied. Although the main fighting style will be slashing it up with your sword, each monster has a unique weakness that you can take advantage of with a variety of weapons. Link not only totes a one-handed sword and shield, but he also get's access to a sling shot and deku seeds, boomerang, hook shot, bow and arrows, bombs, deku sticks, deku nuts, and two impressive two-handed weapons: a hammer and a sword. These weapons can all be used in different ways to different effects at various times in the games.\n\nAlthough the game would have been interesting enough with just those weapons, the game is further varied by magic. Link can wield three types of hand magic, as well as three types of magic arrows. This adds another level of monster fighting, where Link tries to find the weakness so he can move in and dice them up.\n\nApart from the impressive array of weapons, Link also packs a varied wardrobe. The stoic hero is far from interested in fashion (I mean, he runs around in a tunic and tights with a long cap, so he obviously doesn't care about his looks), so each piece has a specific use. You can mix and match boots and tunics for different benefits. Some bosses can only be beat with the right combination of clothing and shields, and figuring out how to use which items against a difficult boss is part of what makes Zelda OCT a great game.\n\nWait, there's still more to combat. Apart from the variety of moves and effects Link can muster with his impressive array of items, there is also horseback combat. You can ride around on Epona, a fierce, wild, mare who only listens to you, and shoot things with your bow and arrow. There are also mini games centered around the fun and challenging horseback combat.\n\nSummary:\nZelda OCT is an excellent Action-Adventure RPG with an epic story line that seamlessly melds a complex kingdom and elegant fighting style into a grand video game. The characters are interesting, with even the most minor sentinels having a back story that you can uncover. The main story is fun to progress through, and you care about a lot of the characters you meet. The controls are excellent and perfectly integrated for fun, non-frustrating, game play. The bosses are challenging, requiring wit to uncover their weakness from the surroundings and circumstances before you can move in and damage them with your sword.\n\nFinal Note:\nIf the 64 is too retro for you, Zelda OCT has been remade for the Gamecube with newer graphics. However, the Gamecube controller does not integrate as seamlessly as the 64 (understandably) so you will miss out on a large part of what made Zelda 64 great.

The graphical content and gore was stunning to my 5 year old eyes. The first level took me forever to beat and I only beat it once. Plus I didn't have a controller pak. Then came the day I bought it again for my n64, nothing looks more sexy than Turok 2 in a green nintendo 64. The first time I ever beat it and it took as long as it did to beat a metroid game and there are only 6 levels. Weapons in old games to begin with were always amazing. I was always able to hold as many as they would let me. Such as doom, Turok, South park, Armorines, perfect dark, etc. Then new games came along and ruined everything that is great about Fps. Sure they have better graphics and frame rate. But they are all the same to be honest. Emulators sucks ass I don't care if its rgb or not. But just old games from dos to the beginning game cube fps's are all I got. But something about the way a n64 looks and the way the graphics look on it just make me love it so much. To me it's the best looking system and has the best looking games. Turok tops it all! Way ahead of its time it set the standard of what the n64 was capable of. Turok 2 is on pc and n64. The n64 game had stencil bits and made the game take a hit in frame rate. Stencil bit shadows were a new thing in 98 so iguana tried it out. In my honest opinion I wouldn't have even cared if the shadows were just the classic circle or just no shadows at all. Still it is stunning the n64 could handle what was thrown at it. The AI in the game was the most fascinating thing I have ever seen in a game and still is. They are smart and fight one another (really fun to watch) I found the game to run best in Hi-res-LB and looks the best as well. The weapons are still the coolest weapons in any game on the face of this planet and all of them are uniquely different. My favorite weapons are the Tek Bow, Shotgun, War-blade, Razor-wind, Cerebral bore, Plasma Rifle, Mag-60, Grenade launcher, the kick ass Charge Rifle (ONE OF THE BEST LOOKING WEAPONS), Firestorm Cannon (like a mini-gun but different and bad ass sounding), Nuke, Flamethrower (The first fire to actually show 3D even in almost all games on n64), and the torpedo Launcher (because you can go through water faster). Music has always been one of my favorite things when it comes to games because the music sets the mood and Turok 2 has the best music in any n64 game I have ever heard, sorry Perfect Dark your music and K7-Avenger are great to but Turok is to bad ass. Iguana seemed to like it so much and acclaim that, that the music is in all Turok games as well as Vexx and Armorines and more have some similar sound. The multiplayer in Turok 2 to me is absolutely stunning (I run that in low-res) and is just as good as Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, The world is not enough, and Turok Rage wars. Quite a few games ran on the Turok engine as well. Armorines (a amazing game! Uniquely different yet just as awesome), and South Park (not many liked this game but to me it's like a mixture of Doom+Turok=South park!... The multiplayer is good to just don't go above 2 players.) So you see Turok 2 was used in many things and is an amazing game. Once you play it you will wish iguana and acclaim still existed. They were the company that developed and distributed games with their say so. Making their games unique. Most hated their games but they never looked at the work they did. Extreme G2 for example had so much done to it that it to suffered frame rate and certain levels were unplayable in single player Grand Prix but in time trials they all ran smooth and helped with remembering everything. Extreme g2 to me is the best out of the series. I have almost every game by Acclaim and love every game (except turok 3, its a good run the first time but compared to dinosaur hunter and seeds of evil it is crap). So Turok 2 is amazing! if you want to try it get it now! on n64 or even on PC! You will love the game and see all the death animations and creative designs and levels! Turok is the greatest fps try them all! (your own risk for 3 but a good to the collection) Dinosaur Hunter 1 amazing smooth game great n64 game, the first fps on n64. Seeds Of Evil 2 Worthy sequel and is amazing in graphics and game play. Shadow Of Oblivion a okay game for the first run but great for the collection. Rage Wars the true sequel or attachment to Turok 2 and has great multiplayer and just as bad ass guns. Evolution fantastic remake of the first Turok starring Tal'set and has amazing weapons and is the biggest game of them all featuring over 14 chapters and has awesome multiplayer. Turok PC,360,ps3 I played it on 360, Runs on the Unreal Engine (which is bad ass) a great game with good weapons (Why I liked it is because I was quick and accurate, I run faster than slow ass call of duty and has worthy death animations like Turok 2 but not as good and not as good music, awesome multiplayer [if anyone is on] and a good campaign). These are the Turok games! Which started out as comics and became life and were playable. Get Turok 2 you will enjoy it! And bring a few friends over!

And the weapons are freaking awesome (just wait till you see the Cerebral Bore).\n\nBut there's a big problem with it: DESIGN\n\nI'm not talking about the art direction or graphical look.  \"Turok 2\" is still a good-looking game with gruesome enemies and solid lighting effects.  But these levels are confusing as all hell, with the exception of the 1st one.  If we had a better story to go along with it, then maybe there'd be a reason to plow through.  But for whatever reason, Acclaim & Iguana decided to force the player to scour every inch of the 6 levels, and if you're stuck, you're stuck for good.\n\nYou will be required to light beacons, find keys, and rescue children.  Again, Level 1 isn't so bad, but Levels 2-6 are gonna be a pain in the butt if you get lost.  The map you're given sucks.  And to make matters worse, you can't leave or quit levels once you've selected them.\n\nBut if you're not too proud to grab a strategy guide or go online, then \"Turok 2\" will be more fun than perhaps some of us had back in 2000.

The one game where I discovered something new almost every time I played.  It was the one game which brought me and my friends together religiously at least 3 or 4 times a week.  Somehow it just wouldn't die, no matter how hard we tried.\nAt first, it just seemed so standard and bland.  Playing muliplayer for the first time, I had problems finding guns and felt confused and bored running through the Temple level.  soon, somehow, something clicked, and me and my friends  ended up playing it for about 4 hours straight.  Towards the end of that introductory marathon Goldeneye session, we took our first stride out of the standard Deathmatch restriction- increasing my character's health to its highest limit and my friends fighting against me.  Thus we coined the \"God\" mode, and we played this variant to death in the coming months.\nIt didn't end there.  We had fests where we would do nothing but attack each other with punches.  We bought a bunch of video cable and conected three televisions together to form a sort of splitscreen, LAN-type mode, covering up other player's screens so we wouldn't know where the other players were.  We playedthe Team mode constantly, refining our knowledge of the levels and our marksmanship.  Fed up with auto-aiming, we turned it off and further honed our skills.  I began to be able to play the Complex level in my sleep.  Proximity mines soon became an addiction.  We pushed the game to its limits, learning that we could move the ammo boxes, shields, and guns around by shooting them, thus reworking their positions and creating large stockpiles in team games.  We began to use Gameshark to unlock multiplayer maps that weren't intended for the final version, as well as increasing the limits on two and three player maps to four players.  We discovered a code that turned one player invisible, and proceeded to do hunter-hunted scenarios over splitscreen.\nBasically, it was the first game to really show limitless possibilities.  It was a revolution for first-person shooters, and so many have overlooked this fact.  It was the first to have targeting of individual body parts, over 20 weapons to choose from, realistic glass, shooting out of lights, and bullet holes, and for its time fairly revolutionary AI.

Forget a touchdown, this game ran the ball for fifteen hundred yards, with three interceptions and a dozen field goals. Nothing on a home console was even close to its league. And even today, in the afterglow of behemoths like Halo, Metroid Prime and a limitless roster of PC shooters, the game holds up surprisingly well considering its limitations.\n\nIt's difficult to call any game \"perfect.\" No matter how original, how exciting, how breathtaking it may look, sound, play or feel, there remain a couple frustratingly overlooked areas, and Goldeneye is no exception. Most notably poor are the one or two levels which feature a limitless stockpile of enemy soldiers. No lie, I've memorized the layout of a base from start to finish, known there's nowhere these soldiers could be coming from, and watched as dozens and dozens miraculously appear from thin air to resume their fallen brothers' attack. It makes strategy an impossibility and frustrates the player to their wits' end. In addition, there's the small matter of dead or dying enemy soldiers who stand in the way. Every once in a while, an armed adversary will take a head shot and then stand, blankly staring, for several moments before slowly dropping to the floor. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if the other soldiers' bullets couldn't pass right through him. So you'll often find yourself firing into the chest of a dead man, a futile attempt to get at the soldiers behind him, all the while taking fire from those still breathing on the other side of his body. Despite my small misgivings however, 99% of this game plays flawlessly. The progression of difficulty is astounding, moving from the relatively easy early levels to a series of seemingly impassible stages near the cart's conclusion. And it's all done while walking that razor's edge between being excessively cheap and being overly giving. The player realises these missions are possible, even as he's watching Bond die for the twelfth time in as many minutes.\n\nAdd to all that three difficulty levels, cheats that must be unlocked with speed, precision and overall know-how, hidden stages and hidden characters. Not only do you have a legendary FPS, you've also found nearly limitless replay value. Goldeneye is more than just a very good game, it's the stuff legends are made of. It's a game you'll want to play with your grandkids years from now.\n\nHands down, the most attractive part about Bond's N64 debut, even today, is its controls. The Nintendo 64 controller was seemingly created exclusively for use with 007's repertoire, as every button is in precisely the right place for its function. It truly is the kind of thing that takes five minutes to learn and a lifetime to master. The center grip of the N64 controller seems to BECOME the handle of a silenced PP7, Bond's revolver of choice. The \"Z\" button is a perfect trigger, and if you've purchased a Rumble Pack you can even feel the weapon kick back when you fire. Strafing is done effortlessly with the right hand, as is crouching and adjusting the zoom of a sniper rifle. No control system has ever felt so immersive, so right. After the first level, you hardly recognize the controller is there, it's already become such an extension of your own body. I can't sing any higher a praise than that.\n\nIf you've seen the feature film of the same name, you'll notice some eerie similarities. Everything, from the writing on a wall in the city to the placement of the soldiers deep within a Russian bunker is precisely as it was seen on the silver screen. It's honestly unsettling, how well the level designers did their jobs. Ever wondered what was behind that last bathroom stall in the film? You'll get your chance to find the answer on the N64. It's an experience I can't really put into words, something I'd never seen before and haven't seen since. It's a level of perfectionism that has yet to be matched in a video game adaption.\n\nFinally, there's the multiplayer aspect of 007. While the single-player mode is challenging, unique and groundbreaking, multiplayer is absolutely unreal. I had the good fortune of living in a large college dorm complex at the time this game was first released, and thus experienced more multiplayer Bond than I'd wish on anyone. There were literally lines leading into my room, just for the chance to grab one of our four controllers and get into the action. It was an addictive community event, whenever that little red light on the front of our N64 lit up. Truly something special. With multiple modes of play, a handful of playable levels, some hidden surprises and dozens of options, you were guaranteed to never play the same match twice, and it didn't take much for the lighthearted action to become a cold-hearted war. In a time and place where four player deathmatches are a no-brainer, it's hard to imagine a game that pioneered the field. Goldeneye blazed that path, and did so in style. It cleared out the weeds, flattened the hills, and paved the roads that Halo drives its way across today. Truly, the game was revolutionary and it still plays as such.\n\nIn short, Goldeneye is almost reason alone to own a Nintendo 64, even today. There's a charm about it that can't be described, a realism and authenticity that goes beyond the aging graphics and occasionally slow gameplay. It's got the look and feel of a legend, and that's exactly the word I'd use to describe it. While there are certainly flaws, this is a game you'll kick yourself for never owning in a few years, when it becomes increasingly difficult to track down.", "summary": "Buried Gold on the N64", "unixReviewTime": 1041292800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2002", "reviewerID": "A2USAZNAK5EE1J", "asin": "B00000DMAT", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "reviewText": "My N64, it acts like a rock sitting right there under my tv.

It was like Mortal Kombat, except in a shooting-game. Blood everywhere, amazing enemies and weapons, and a good, good time. And I'll admit this; I don't actully play the Turok games. No, I'm sorry, I don't. It's not that their hard, or boring, but I don't play them...well, not without the cheats at least. As soon as I find out a new Turok game's coming, I get on the internet, go to Happypuppy.com, and find the Master Cheat. Yeah, it's pretty low, but it's fun to go in these blood-soaked shooter games. And the second one is no exception. I played this game without cheats for a few hours, made up my mind, and decided it was great, and would be even better with cheats.\nHalf an hour later, I came back with the Master cheat in my hand, which is \"BEWAREOBLIVIONISATHAND\", or, if you break it down, \"BEWARE OBLIVION IS AT HAND\". Within minutes, I had an amazing arsenal, all maps, invincibility, and more by my side. The weapons...well, let's just say the first Turok can't touch them. You have the usual knife and bow and arrow, pistol, shotgun, and the rest, but you now also have a nuke, pod layer (which lays bombs on the ground and they explode on contact), a machine gun (as the first had, but this one's much better), the Cerebrial Bore (the most gory weapon of all. It launches out a little ball, and it goes straight for the enemies head. When it gets there, it starts sucking and draining blood form their head, then, after 5 second, it explodes, and takes the enemies head with it), my personal favorite, the Razor Wind (a shield with sharp edges on it. You throw it and it cuts up all enemies in it's path, then come right back to you. It can chop off just about any limb you throw it at; the head, the legs, and the arms), and another physical weapon, the War Blade. The name says it all.\nOverall, this game is a vast improvement, and is the best yet (but that might change as soon as I play \"Evolution\").

They're just so clunky, most of the time you can't tell where you're going, you don't know if an enemy is behind you, (Or at times even in front of you, if you get a weird camera angle) and plus might I add that you can't see your character, which does not really, (For me, most of the time) give that whole imaginative feel that you ARE that character.\n  Well, Goldeneye is an excellent and well made game.\n  I don't know why people complain about the graphics...it's actually kind of cool, and plus the enemies in this game are from head to toes so detailed that you think they're real.  The scientists in the facility level are well detailed, and most all the characters are animated incredibly.\n  Besides, you take on the role of James Bond.  James Bond! The hero that defined action! This game is not dull, and at times it is so scary when you are overswarmed by a bunch of enemies in one small room.\n  The multiplayer mode, is, of course, wonderful.  You can choose from power weapons, sniper rifels, Dostovals, Shotguns, PP7's, proximity mines, hand grenades, laser guns, and basicly everything else that you can think of.  It is an entertaining game, and it is well worth the money.\n  The camera angles rock.  you never get lost.\n  So, why didn't I give this game Five stars?  Read below and find out.\n\n  THE BADS OF THE GAME\n  There are some major glitches.  You can see your enemies literally walk through walls, not completely, but almost there.\n  At times the doors, when I command it to open with the B button, it still won't open, even if I already DID get an access card for the door in the first place.  The reason behind that is the fact that an enemy is probably trying to open the door as well, but how am I supposed to know that? So, I stand back, the enemy comes in, and oh, guess what, it turns out that there isn't just one of them, there's thirty, so they all shoot at me, and I die.  You can easily die in this game just due to glitches, which makes it very difficult and frustrating.\n  If you forget one thing on a mission, just one small thing which most of the time has nothing to do with the story, then you have to start the whole mission over again.  You don't just do the thing you forgot, either, you have to do all the things that you did do, as well as the things you did not.\n  The game is predictible, due to the fact that it follows the movie, although when it does not follow the movie, (Which it does a lot) then it gets kind of dissapointing because what you expected did not happen.\n  The puzzles can be frustrating.  I'm still trying to figure out how to get the bottling room on the facility level.\n  The game is also very gory.  I don't know why they gave this game a TEEN rating instead of a mature...it should of been rated mature.\n\n  Now, for the GOODS of this game.\n  GOODS\n  Use an incredibly large arsenal of weaponry and more weaponry...prepare to save the world, it's gonna be a rough ride.\n  It follows the movie really well, (Most of the time, anyways) And if you're a big fan of james bond you will really enjoy this game.  Even if you aren't you'll still enjoy it.\n  You play the role of james Bond, which is worth it within itself.\n  This game is the greatest First person shooter game for the N64.  The controls aren't so difficult that you'll get lost and forget which buttons to use while you're losing, but they are simple and easy and at the same time fun.  And even if you don't like the controls, you can decide which buttons you want for which ones the controller screen.\n  There's nothing that you can't shoot or destroy.\n  The cheats are FUNNY!  I mean, honestly, try the invisibility mode. You can shoot a near bye dashboard when a Gaurd is near, and that gaurd will start freaking out and look around to see who did that.  This makes the game easier also, and the invincibility mode is good too, although I tried and realized that you can't have the invisibility mode and invincibility at the same time.  You can also make the bad guys heads small and stuff, which is really funny to see.\n  The way that the characters are animated are almost identicle to the characters in the movie...they look exactly like the actors.\n  At the end of every level, it tells you how many kills you did, how many limb shots, how many head shots, and how many body shots you had.\n  The artificial intelligence with the badguys aren't all that challenging, but when there's a whole crowd of them, watch out!\n  This game is excellent.

Is there even a reason to keep this system around anymore? Is there one game to give you an excuse to say to Playstation2 and X-Box and Gamecube owners, \"I know it's an old system, but this game is the reason I still own it\"? Yes, and that game is called \"Golden Eye 007\".\nIt's hard to believe that a game based off the best of the Pierce Brosnan \"Bond\" movies would become an undeniable classic. But that's exactly what \"Golden Eye\" is. Many first-person shooters try to overwhelm gamers with unbelievable graphics while offering no depth in gameplay, while others try to create complex game engines with passable graphics and end up only frustrating players. Thankfully, \"Golden Eye\" is the diamond in the rough. It takes a remarkably simple control scheme and graphics that were good for its time and combines them in an unbeatable combination. Moving Bond, James Bond is as easy as breathing, and the shooting system is just as simple. Even with the horrible N64 controller, a player can learn how to play \"Golden Eye\" on the first or second try. And its gameplay is so addictive because of the stunning level designs and adequate AI. Of course, because of the N64's difficult-to-program cartridge format, some things had to be sacrificed, like detailed textures and realistic AI responses to being shot. But the overall experience is enough to overlook such trivial matters.\nGraphically, \"Golden Eye 007\" was a marvel to look at...when it was first released. Nowadays, when compared to games like \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" for the PS2 and \"Dead or Alive 3\" for the X-Box, \"Golden Eye\" looks like a SNES game. Because cartridges are limited in space, textures can be bland, character models look blocky, and detail is kept to a passable minimum. But anyone who doesn't care about graphics, as long as they are good enough and the gameplay is excellent, shouldn't have any trouble with \"Golden Eye\".\nSoundwise, it's not the biggest strength of the game, but it's still good. Sounds like gunshots are remarkably well done - a player can tell what kind of gun he or an enemy is firing just by listening to it, at least to a certain extent. And voices, while limited to overdone grunts and questionable laughs, suit the game well. It would've been nice to hear full voiceovers for important characters, but the limitations of the cartridge format doesn't help this area much.\nAll in all, \"Golden Eye\" is undoubtedly a classic of modern gaming. While the N64 is arguably one of the worst Nintendo consoles to be released (alongside the horrendous Virtua Boy), it still had some incredible games that managed to sustain it until the Gamecube was announced. \"Golden Eye\" is not only the game that many FPS fans point to as their favorite game, but many non-FPS gamers also found it very enjoyable. While later great first-person shooters like the N64's \"Perfect Dark\" and the recent X-Box million-seller \"Halo\" presented excellet FPS action with updated graphics to boot, \"Golden Eye\" will forever be remembered as the first-person shoot for the masses.\nIf you need a reason to keep your N64, this is it!", "summary": "One of the defining first-person shooters in existence!", "unixReviewTime": 1018396800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2002", "reviewerID": "A2YAABMT80RLYA", "asin": "B00000DMAT", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Ben Rowland", "reviewText": "\"Goldeneye 007\", at first glance, looks like yet another installment into the tired and outdated \"First-Person\" shooter game genre. The big suprise is that it is so much more than a standard shooter or a bog standard movie translation.\nIn a word, \"Goldeneye\" is amazing. It takes full advantage of the 64 bit technology and delivers a smooth, fun, and challenging adventure. You assume the role of James Bond, the secret agent who needs no introduction. You run through various missions, which tie into the movie, and solve various problems and perform various tasks. What complicates things is the number of guards who are ready to kill you on sight. As expected, you have a number of weapons at your disposal, from the silenced pistol and machine gun, to the grenade launchers and high-powered explosives. The first-person perspective adds amazing realism to this game, with action and controls that are as smooth as James Bond's charm.\nThe graphics are phenominal, with smooth movements and amazing scenery. This game really makes you feel like you are living the adventures. The music is right out of a Bond movie, and adds a nice edge to the action.

Klein", "reviewText": "After checking GameSpot's (author's note: this was originally posted exclusively on GameSpot.com) and a few user reviews, I absolutely had to throw my two cents in. I couldn't help but laugh when I read the introduction of \"Even with all its bells and whistles, Mario Kart 64 is very likely to disappoint you after about a week.\"\n\nWhen I picked up this game initially, my thoughts were \"SWEET! A new Super Mario Kart!\" I, unfortunately, never had an SNES of my own, so my fixes came in the form of time at my friend's house.\n\nThis game is absolutely spectacular in every way. Yes, I do feel that it could benefit from maybe a higher difficulty level and there is also the fact that it's possible to clinch a Gold medal in a circuit (4 races) after finishing in the top spot in each of the first three races. However, other than these minor spots, I find it to be flawless. Everything from the graphics to the sound to the features are great. There is also a great amount of multiplayer available in this, with not only the up to four player split-screen, but the track ghosts as well. Track ghosts are saved data of your best race (single player only) on a course. The game saves not only your time but your entire race. When you race against your ghost, you can actually compare yourself second-by-second on the tracks and this also helps you to analyze spots and what you did to help you become a better racer.\n\nThe items are what really make multiplayer fun, though. I've had many a time where I have something such as a ghost (which lets you steal and item and makes you invisible/invincible) while my friend had a lightning bolt (shrinks all opponents) and it's a quick reaction race to see who can get their item deployed first. To me, however, there is nothing more satisfying than hitting your opponent (especially if it's a friend instead of the computer) with a green shell (a shell that fires straight out, as opposed to the red homing shells) as he's about to cross the finish line to win, not just the race, but the circuit as well. And, yes, I actually did that to a friend of mine. Talk about bragging rights.\n\nUp to this point, I have kept (or at least tried to keep) retro-rating out of this review and I was considering dropping one of the five rankings to a 9 because I'm stingy with giving out perfect 10's. If I had rated this game when it first came out, it would probably be rated somewhere around 9.7 to 9.9. However, there is one reason, and one reason only, that I still own my N64 -- and that is to play Mario Kart 64 ... a decade later. (Note: I can't even say that about Zelda: OoT or GoldenEye.) That, in itself, I think warrants the move up to the perfect 10 rating. ... I guess this pretty much means that I'll have to give Super Mario Kart a 10 as well. I guess we'll see when I finally get it on Virtual Console. (For those of you who ask \"Virtual Console? Why\" Read: paragraph 2.)\n\nOverall: 10\nGameplay: 10\nGraphics: 10\nSound: 10\nValue: 10\nTilt: 10", "summary": "The highly-elusive perfect 10!", "unixReviewTime": 1204848000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2008", "reviewerID": "A119JJYMU6GNMA", "asin": "B00000DMAX", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "StandDameDrummer", "reviewText": "This game can keep you busy all day with excitement and fun!

Nubs.  Lulz.\n\nMy parents just bought me \"The Legend of Zeldo: Collector's Edition\" for my 14th birthday. It features this \"Legend of Zeldo: Oracana of Time\" game. I enjoyed this game very much...even tho the graphics suck! I will give you some of my thoughts now!\n\nMy favorite part was when the main character, Link, pulls the Supreme Sword from the stone in the iceberg temple. Oh man! Glammondwarf (the villain) was so cool! He snuck into the Secret Realm behind Link and stole the Trueforce of Strength!!  Pwned!\n\nThe Prince Zeldo person was really weird.  He/she was a tranny who turned into some guy named Shaieke, who kept stalking Link on his journey. Then he/she would change back into an elf girl in a dress. What a creep!  But Zeldo had the Trueforce of Smartness, so I guess that character was okay. Zeldo had this tall white-haired ninja lady named Inca as a bodyguard. Inca might have been a man too though...I'm not sure.  She looked kinda like my aunt Helga.\n\nThe Link character was really cool!  Link wears white tights, a green toga, and had a grappling hook device! He also has this little firefly thing called Navely that follows him around! You begin the game playing Link's little kid brother, which kinda sucked.  I can't pwn Goombas with a little midget (Goombas are these big skeleton guys).  I think the kid brother is supposed be Peter Pan, after he killed Captain Hook and left Neverland (maybe they have another game about that part).\n\nBut later you get to play Link, who is an adult elf with a pointy nose. He has the Trueforce of Braveness, so that means he is very brave. He can throw dynamites into walls to blow them up and reveal secret buried treasures! I wonder if the treasures were hidden by magic pirates?  Later on, Link gets the Bassoon of Time and can play it to make it snow! I think Link is kinda mentally handicapped though because he never talks. He just goes \"Ugh! Hiyah! AUGHHHHHH!\" and stuff.\nI think he might be a cannibal (or vampire) too, because he eats hearts to gain health. There is a really annoying beeping sound that reminds you when it's time to feed.\n\nYou pick up these little colored diamond things called rublees that you can use to buy stuff with. But they look really big, so I wonder how Link can carry so many in his pockets? And if you don't pick the rublees up soon enough, they begin flashing and disappear! I guess they're like...big holograms or something, like in Star Wars.  Why are there so many rublees hidden in the grass and under rocks? I really wish I could mow my parents lawn in real life and find money like that.\n\nThere are these fish people named Zurros. They have this giant jellyfish named Mr. Jabba Jabba and you have to go into his stomach to retrieve an ugly little talking fish-man! I think it was the Zurro king's pet and he lost it. But you have to carry it all around Mr. Jabba Jabba's stomach, so it's kinda annoying.\n\nThen there are these big rock guys called Gordos that like to roll down mountains! They are my favorites because they live in this mountain called Doom Mountain. It explodes like a volcano and tries to kill you!  Holy ****!\n\nThat evil Glammondwarf guy is a member of the Garundo thieves. They are a bunch of ginger women that live on a beach. But they don't have any men in their race, so I don't understand how there are so many Garundos? Maybe some of them are trannies, like Zeldo.  I think Glammondwarf might be one. He kinda sounds like a drag queen when he laughs.\n\nSooooo all of these people live in this magical land called Hirole with a bunch of weird cartoon characters. I think it's supposed to be kinda like Toon Town from Roger Rabbit. It's such a huge place! It takes forever to ride across it on Link's horse, Ramona! That's right! You get a horse! Link steals it from Mario and Luigi at some ranch. So I guess Link is kinda a thief. Maybe he's really one of those Garundo thieves? He does kinda look like a girl.  But he's not a ginger, so I'm not sure.\n\nAaaanyway....play this Bassoon of Time game! It is full of so much WIN!  I hope I didn't give too much of it away!

However, there is a monster shortcut that's very dangerous to go for if you want to make things interesting.\n\nEven though it was too easy, I bought the game anyway.  It's fun to beat the heck out of these computer controlled suckers.  Plus I really like the game's ending.\n\nThere is one hard level, the one with all of the traffic in the extra mode.  It can be very frustrating if you make a mistake, because you get run over again and again and again.

Nintendo got rid of some of the things that made the SNES title so much fun, but added a lot too. The gameplay is much more enhanced, the characters look much better and the individual go-karts are very realistic.\nLike the SNES version, this game includes 3 modes of play: GP (Grand Prix), Battle, and Time Trial. In GP you choose one of 8 characters: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Wario, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and Bowser in a large variety of courses in the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup Star Cup, or Special Cup (which you unlike by getting gold trophies in each of the 3 basic courses) in 50cc, 100cc, or 150cc mode. 50cc is the easiest, but in 100cc and 150cc the computer gets much faster and more challenging. There are several items you can collect by driving through the question mark boxes which help you during each race. Lightning bolts (the rarest item to get) makes all of the other opponents small, mushrooms give you a speed burst, banana peels make one of your opponents crash if they slip on it, red shells are used to shoot directly at an opponent to get them off course, and green shells keep bouncing off the walls until it hits one of the racers. Unlike the SNES Mairo Kart game, there are several objects you need to avoid to stay on course. In different races there are trucks and cars that will make you crash if you hit them, snowmen that will blow up if you hit them, and many other obstacles in different courses.\nIn Battle mode you and up to 3 others choose one of the 8 characters. You drive around a course trying to pop each other's 3 balloons. You can pop their balloons by shooting red or green shells at them or throwing banana peels at them to make them slip. You can also use the other items to avoid being hit by them. Once all of your balloons are popped you become a bomb which you can drive around the course trying to run in to the other players. This mode is a lot of fun, especially if you get tired of continually playing Grand Prix mode.\nIn Time Trial mode you race in any of 15+ courses and try to set records for each lap and/or race.\nThe controls for Mario Kart 64 are very simple and easy to master, and the music and sound effects are great as well.\nIf you want a great racing game for your N64, I highly recommend that you check out Mario Kart 64.", "summary": "One of the best racing games on the N64", "unixReviewTime": 1021075200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2002", "reviewerID": "A3ER878Z9WVNRO", "asin": "B00000DMAX", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Kopaka Nuva", "reviewText": "My favorite part of this game is the battle mode.

This game was one of the first I got for the N64, and it is one of my favorites today. As it gives graphics that were hardly ever seen in the early N64 days, it also has gameplay almost unmatched by the games of it's era. The sound is moderate, but sound isn't a very big facter in deciding the rating of the game.\n  A followup on the early SNES version that was also a hit, this game was certainly watched before it's release date, as it stormed into the N64 world and took many fans (as you can see from it's very high review in many chances) right away. It was considered as a very high class game then, and now too. Many of the N64 owners today have one in their hands, and many of those have played the game for over 24 hrs.\n  This game has wonderful graphics and sound for the era that it was made in. The size of a typical game back then, but with the technical advancements of some of the games today. The graphics are very good, as you can distinguish all characters and objects faster than immediatly. The game also shows no slow down rate no matter how many characters or items are on the screen at the same time.  The sound is entertaining for a while, and it is different for almost all of the 16 courses, showing wonderful compositions with goofy sound added noises at parts.\n  The gameplay is also great. You may pick one of 8 characters to race with. On a small go - cart, you must race on one of the 16 courses and try to get in first. There are many modes. You can race with a group of 8 racers in a grand prix mode, where you may race a total of 4 races and accumulate points. A vs. mode race will put you against a friend or 2 (or 3) in a single race. There is also a battle mode, which will put you against 1 to 3 other players where the last one alive wins.\n  The items in the game play a big part. Some will boost your speed, while some are used to slow down enemies. Some steal enemies items, and some let you do things such as go invincible or invisible. Most of the however, are used to smash your opponents into the air and slow them down. In battle, it will be used as one of 3 hits to destroy the enemy.\n  The characters are the typical mario game characters:  Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, Wario, DK, and Bowser.

First of all, it has a lower polygon count and the characters look much better. The gameplay is simple, but that only means it's easier to learn. The card that comes with the game tells you everything you need to know so all you have to do is plop the game inside the console and start playing.\nSo the characters don't say much. It's mainly just a simple \"Yippee!\" or \"I'm-a Wario and I'm-a gonna win!,\" but there's much more in-game speech than GoldenEye. Sound effects are fine too. The soundtrack is excellent. It ranges from coutry to smooth jazz. Even some major critics of video game music I know have said that the music here is great. You know Koji Kondo's doing something right hearing that.\nMario Kart 64 is addicting with four players, and it can be addicting with one player too. The Time Trials may be a little disappointing, but the Mario GP had me coming back for more.\nThe game is one of the best racing games on the N64. It's better than WaveRace, Diddy Kong Racing, F-Zero X, and even Excitebike 64. Heck it's one of the best games on the N64!

No it's not a compelation of rip off's, this is a classic that is highly addicting, and incredibly fun, if given a chance.\nThe story revolves around a young lad (you name) who on his fifteenth birthday is given the opportunity to become a hunter and explore the depths of the Monster Tower to retrieve riches, however to do so he must not only survive, but grow as a trainer and as a man.  In comes the Kewe, the monster you will likely use for a majority of the game.  He is a fire type (there are only three types) and he is your brief tutorial, and key to success early on.\n ... YOu also must build up your respect to the townsfolk, to do this you must enlarge certain places (Temple, Hospital) and build new things (Library, Gym, Casino, Race Track, Bowling Alley ect..) and the town will grow to respect you.\nNow as for the tower it'self, there are 40 floors, everytime you leave you go back down to level 1.  No it's not immpossible for two reasons.\nA) Your monsters level stays the same when you leave, this is due to the fact that they are more like equipment.\nB) Weapons and armors stay the same, when a red or blue sand is used your weapons and armor grow more powerful, so technically you can easily dominate the first few levels without you monsters assistance.\nOverall this game is tricky, you will die the first few times (lose all your items except monsters)  but once they are strong enough you can succeed.  There are 40 randomly changeing floors and they get more and more difficult as you go along.

It's actually more of a random dungeon game. Like Chocobo Dungeon and Diablo. These games really seem to  fit into there own category these days. Also it has a monster training part  to it where you brought you monster in the dungeon to fight for you. Also  within the game is a very weird part of plot. You get to sees the faces of  the women you have gotten to become your loyal women while you save. If you  run the story correctly on all of them in the end your basically the town  pimp.\nAs far as game play goes when entering the dungeon you are always  brought down to level 1 and only able to take 5 items inside. This is an  annoying thing. Your monsters do not loose levels but as they survive they  loose magic and leave way to fast. Also to keep your weapons in poor shape  early you well have problems with rust traps, which lower their quality.  Also there are items they raise the quality of the weapon and shield (only  equipment you wear) threw the game called sands. A good thing to remember  is gold swords do not rust, neither do diamond or mirror shields. Without  knowing that the game can get pretty boring faster. The game is very  repetitive. You end up doing the same thing over and over again while you  get to the deeper levels of the dungeon again and again. Even though they  change every time it does get old to meet the same monsters hoping for a  sand so you can get to the next floor again and again and again. I fell  asleep while playing this game at least six times.\nAs far as plot goes  the plot within 27 hours of playing you well forget the game had a plot and  you well only be reminded in the very end.\nThe graphics to this game are  sprits. They are not poorly done sprites but I have seen higher quality.  There are many different looking monsters and every couple floors the  dungeon's floor takes a new appearance. But eventually it does some  repeating and none of the pictures are that beautiful.\nAnd finally as far  as length of time it can stay interesting it depends on how patient you  are. This game involves a lot of patience. Even though I fell asleep while  playing it many times I enjoyed it all the way until I beat it, but if you  are going to play it its defiantly a buy game and not a rent  game.\nOverall this game is not for everyone, but if your very patient and  you have a lot of free time to see a weird game that combines monster  raising, dungeon exploring, and...

One is a review of the title, and the other is the how in many ways Ocarina of Time feels like a remake of the eternal SNES classic (and my personal favorite Zelda game), THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: A LINK TO THE PAST. Rather than leave them unposted, I issued them on Amazon back in 2007, one article on the \"Collector's Edition\" (\"Zelda 64 a Remake?\" and and one on the \"Regular\" edition (an actual review of the game). When the 3DS version came out, I wrote a review of that and included both articles on the review as well for bonus content. Originally this review only featured one of the two articles - I am now putting both articles up.\n\nMike London, 9-9-2012\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis commentary on \"Ocarina of Time\" was written as a gaming article for a retro-gaming site back in May of 1999.  I was going to post it on Amazon but for some reason never got around to it.  Mike London, November 3, 2007\n\nArticle 1: Does \"Zelda 64\" really live up to all the hype?\n\n[Blurb: With all the hype, its hard to be objective about OoT.  Is it the best game in the series, or does it have to settle for second (or, egad, third?) best?  Is it like Star Wars Episode I, all special effects and no substance?  Find out a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is easily one of the most hyped games of recent gaming history.  In fact, I think I could safely say it IS the most hyped game yet.  There is only one thing that can compare to it in terms of hype, and this product is in an entirely different industry.  Star Wars: Episode I had the same amount of coverage.  Being a big fan of both, of course I've beat the game and have seen the movie.  And they have one thing in common.  They're both eye candy.  But how do they hold up to the rest of the series?  In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is by far the best Star Wars movie.  But what about OoT you ask?  How can I defame such an instant classic?\n\nOne reason mainly.  In the original and in The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past, (I can't speak for Zelda II because I haven't beat it yet) the ending was spectacular.  Not the game ending, for The Legend of Zelda was produced in the Stone Age and there was much ending wise, but the last dungeon.  Ah, the last dungeon.  Only recently (like December 23, 1999) have I beat the first quest of The Legend of Zelda.  That last dungeon on Death Mountain was a killer, a true challenge that you had to match your mettle with to get past it, save Princess Zelda and beat that nasty ol' Gannon.  It was truly a great dungeon.  Now skip on past those five years between the release of the original and the SNES version.  What have we here?  A dungeon comparable to that in the original Legend of Zelda!  Everything is bigger and better in the SNES version, including the last dungeon.  Whew, and I thought the original was harder, but no way!\n\nThen, in 1993, we see the release of the Game Boy version of Zelda.  The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was released to a very receptive crowd.  But guess what!  No end dungeon!  In terms of dungeons, this is the smallest of the Zelda titles (again, not including Zelda II).  You beat eight dungeons, and then you go and beat the Wind Fish.  Personally, I'm half a dungeon away from completing this Zelda game (Dungeon Seven, which I completed half of, went and beat eight, and now I'm back on the last half of VII).  That last dungeon was challenging, granted, but what about that classic end dungeon?  No where to be found here.  Granted, it's a Game Boy game, and it is huge for that consol.  So that offence is not to serious.  And we did get a new dungeon, though not the ending I was hoping for, with the Colour Dungeon on DX, which was the rerelease of the classic game for Game Boy Colour.\n\nAfter five long years, The Legend of Zelda: Orcarina of Time was released for the N64.  So cool!  Link in a 3D adventure.  About time too.  Mario, the cash cow counterpart to Link, got his 3D adventure way back in `96.  Of course, I bought the game.  And of course, I beat it.  It is an excellent game.  Truly it is one of the great classics.  But one flaw keeps it from edging out The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past.  The end dungeon absolutely sucked.  That is my only disappointment with that game.  As I was nigh the close of the Shadow Temple, I was really looking forward to getting into Gannon's tower.  I was expecting a great closer dungeon, just like in Link to the Past.\n\n[Spoiler: If you haven't beat the 64 version of Zelda, don't read this]\n\nWhat did we get?  Instead of a great closer dungeon, we got a door way that was blocked by barriers.  What did we have to do?  Go thru six rooms and beat whatever was in them, then go and shoot the barrier corresponding with each temple to open the pathway.  And what did I get?  A great disappointment.  Sure, this might have been a good way to end a novel or something, but to end a Zelda game like that was horrible.  The Game Boy was forgivable and acceptable, but this ending to Zelda 64 was truly despicable.  That has been my biggest disappointment with the Zelda series.\n\n[Spoiler Finished]\n\nOthers say The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the best Zelda game.  I have to disagree.  Don't get me wrong.  It is easily one of my favorite games of the N64.  It's a great game, very innovative (espically that nifty Z Targeting feature) and an epic in its own right.  But for what the system is capable of, The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past beats it out of the coveted title of Best Zelda Game.  LTTP is huge.  It fully utilized the SNES technology.  It had a full twelve dungeons, two of which the sole purpose was to beat the bad guy, and not try to retrieve any medallions or crystals or pendents or pieces of triforce or what ever.  That's one more than the original has.  (LoZ has one closer dungeon for each quest.)  After you beat the bad guy twice, you go and fight Ganon.  There were plenty of side quests for an SNES Zelda also.  Overall, for the system's capabilites, LTTP is my favorite.\n\nBut what about The Legend of Zelda: OoT?  My two chief complaints are these:\n  1.  Weak closer dungeon (as I spent a good time detailing up above).\n  2.  Not enough bad guys to kill in the Overworld.\n\nAll other Zelda games, including the black sheep of the family (Zelda II), has plenty of bad guys to kill in the Overworld.  But what have we in OoT?  A few measly skeleton dudes at night, and some giant flying plants that you can hardly get too in Hyrule Field.  Give me the old Zelda with bad guys streaming at you in every new screen.  For all the time they put into it, you don't think it would be to hard to correct this problem.\n\nThen we come to another mistake Nintendo made in the N64 version of Zelda.  Granted, LoZ had two main tracks, one being the Overworld theme and then the dungeon theme.  They could have had more variety, but it was back in the Stone Age.  That Overworld Theme became pretty much the theme of the entire series.  And guess what they decided to omit music wise from OoT?  The Overworld them from the original LoZ!  I couldn't believe they did that!  Hopefully we'll see it in Zelda Gaiden.  Maybe the Triforce will show up in that game too.  Just a thought.\n\nNow, after railing on OoT for a great majority of this article, you may think I hate the game.  Quite the opposite, really.  It's a great game, and worthy to be in the Zelda Series.  (Gee, it sounds like I'm defending Zelda II, which I've already done in a separate article).  But it has been the single most hyped up game in the history of Nintendo, and it is totally out of balance.  Great 3D game, but would have been better had it corrected the problems I stated above.  It's a fun game, and I had a great time beating it.  It provides a lot of enjoyment.  But, just like Star Wars: Episode I, it just can't live up to all that hype?  I wonder if any game (or movie) could actually.\n\n[May 9, 1999.  An article originally written for NintendoLand.com.  I've written four released articles and one unreleased article (dealing with SMB 2).  It will have to be edited.  Also, perhaps incorporating part of the structural symmetry article.]\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArticle 2:\n[Originally this was written for a retro-gaming site back in early January, 2000. It has never appeared on Amazon.]\n\nZelda 64 a Remake?\n\n[Blurb: Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda has several similarities, almost to the point that the basic game design of Zelda 64 is a remake. Read here for more information on this intriguing phenomena! Just a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]\n\nAfter playing the course of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, I've noticed something very intriguing about it. It seems to be a rehash of what I feel is the best Zelda game: LoZ: Link to the Past. Why do I say this? I say this because there are several structural symmetries that lie between Zelda 64 and LTTP.\n\nLets examine it. For one, there are three pendants you have to acquire in LTTP. This is after you go and rescue Zelda and leave her at the temple. Well, this time around, you don't rescue Zelda, but you do go and talk to her. After that, when you get the three pendants, you go and she is kidnaped. This is after you get the Master Sword in the Lost Woods. In Zelda 64, you go thru the first part of the quest, getting three spiritual stones. After you get those three spiritual stones (which I think the tower on LTTP is much better than that d----- Lord Jabu Jabu's belly. I hated that dungeon! =)), you go to the town. Guess what, as Link approaches, there it cuts to a cinema, and Zelda is kidnaped by Ganondorf. Hmm . . . haven't we seen this story before? It turns out that you have to get 5 of the Sage's medallions. Rauru conveniently gives you one, so we can cut the sixth one away. Only by getting the six sage medallions can you open the bridge to fight Ganondorf. How intriguing.\n\nIn the superiour SNES Zelda counterpart, it is seven crystals, and you don't get one given to you. Link wakes no sages this time. Instead, the seven maidens of the wise men descent have been hidden in deep dank dungeons, and Link has to transverse thru 13 dungeons all together, 5 the first part, and eight the second part. They are challenging, fun, and intriguing. Granted, Zelda 64 has some great stuff. But it is not as consistent as LTTP. After you have gone thru the seven dungeons (two more than in Zelda 64), you now have all seven crystals. That's great! Now, go to Death Mountain, and by doing so you will open the way to Ganon's big bad temple.\n\nOkay, what do we have in Zelda 64? You go and get the five medallions, plus the one that Rauru gives you as Link. Guess what? Now you have to go to his tower, and open the rainbow bridge with the six medallions.* Hmm . . . isn't that what we did in SNES Zelda? Why, I do believe it is, Watson!\n\nAnother issue yet addressed is the Light World/Dark World. Zelda 64 does the same thing, save this time it is time traveling (I'm not even going to go into the impossibilities of time travel on this . . . that's a whole separate article in itself). In SNES Zelda, you have a little mirror the old man gave you. There are eight transporters located thruout Hyrule, transporting back and forth. If you are in the Dark World, you can use the mirror to go into the Light World, making a temporary transporter. Well, in Zelda 64, there is no mirror or transporters (the closest to a mirror is the Lens of Truth, found nigh in the Shadow Temple). But if you go and put the sword back, then you go back to being young. That creates two versions of the same world to explore. That structural symmetry corresponds to LTTP. Not only that, but at the end if the first three stones, Link goes to the Temple of Time and gets the sword. This is after the three Spiritual Stones goes into place. Hmm . . . isn't that what happened in LTTP? After getting the three pendents, Link goes to the Lost Woods and retrieves the Master Sword. But he cannot do that until he has all three pendents. Well, that's the same in Zelda 64. He can't get the Ocarina of Time, now can he retrieve the sword, until he wins the corresponding three spiritual stones. I swear I've played this game before . . . . ; )\n\nThe real question is why did Nintendo do this? Well, Miyamoto is a great gamming god, but as far as stories go, his team is not that good at having connecting story lines that make sense. Again, another article, another time. The structural symmetries lying between Zelda 64 and LTTP is quite frightening. Who knows why they chose to do that? Granted, the story line is different, but quite a few of the fundamentals behind both pieces are indeed the same. In review:\n\nA Listing of Structural Symmetries between SNES Zelda and Zelda 64\n\n1. SNES: First Part, Link goes and retrieves three pendants after rescuing Zelda. This is to get the Master Sword. Upon doing so, and after giving the Pendants up to retrieve the Sword, Zelda is kidnaped.\n\n2. N64: Link, after receiving a mission from the Deku Tree, goes and wins the three Spiritual Stones. Upon doing so, he goes to Hyrule City, but not before learning Zelda is kidnaped. He places the three Spiritual Stones in their place, and the Door of Time is opened, and there the sword is. Retrieving the Sword, goes to the Temple of Sages, or whatever it is called. Is given first Sage Medallion.\n\n3. SNES: After winning the three pendents, Link must now go between two versions of the world (Light World/Dark World). Link must go back and forth between the two worlds to beat the game.\n\n4. N64: In this great stunning adventure, Link must go between two versions of his world. One is when he is young, the other when he is an adult. This is achieved by putting the sword back in its pedestal. Just like in SNES LTTP, Link have to go back and forth to finish the game.\nWhen he is an adult, things are noticeable more evil, for Ganon's power has grown.\n\n5. SNES: One version (Light World) is good because not corrupted by Ganon. Version II (Dark World), is an evil corrupted version of the Light World.\n\n6. N64: One version (Young Link's world) is not corrupted by Ganon's evil. Ganon has just recently showed up. Version II (Adult Link's world), is an evil corrupted version (albeit older) of Young Link's world. The only difference is in one its two different versions of the same thing, in Zelda 64 it's the time barrier. But for game play, they're the same.\n\n7. SNES: He, Link, must recover seven crystals hidden in seven dungeons (sounds logical). With the maidens' power, they will open to door to Ganon's castle.\n\n8. N64: Link has to recover five medallions to open Ganon's Tower.\n\n9. SNES: The (massive) closer dungeon is a tower.\n\n10. N64: The (weak) closer dungeon is a tower.\n\n11. SNES: After beating Ganon, you save Zelda, who had been kidnaped. Although one could argue you save her in Turtle Rock, she is still imprisoned in the Crystal with the other maidens, each in their respective Crystals.\n\n12. N64: Sticking to the standard Nintendo story, after recovering the medallions and beating Ganon, guess what, Link saves Zelda. There's a shocker.\n\n13. SNES: There are various mini-games, heart pieces, and extra things to do. This trend is continued in Link's Awakening also.\n\n14. Zelda 64: Stuck with the trend of mini-games, four heart pieces to make a heart, and extra things to do.\n\n15. SNES: In some of the houses, you can find a picture of Mario on the wall.\n\n16. N64: In Zelda 64, after meeting Zelda, look out the window, and you can find some pictures of Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and the Princess. Yoshi also comes up. Malon and Talon wear Bowser amulets also. Just goes to show, Nintendo likes cameos.\n\nAs you can see for yourself, the various structural symmetries between Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda is quit a few. If Miyamoto wanted to do a remake of LTTP for N64 that's what he should have done, I suppose. This, as far as story goes, is pretty much an update with little changed. Its like they took the game's basic plot, changed the circumstances and added where appropriate, but allowing the basic structure to stand. And, although both are great games, sadly, SNES is better, consistently with each dungeon getting a little harder and more complex. But I love Ocarina of Time all the same. This just helps support my believe that Nintendo is first and foremost a gaming company, not a writing company.\n\n*In all previous Zelda games, the end dungeon was in the mountains. This is the first game in the series to break that trend. The first three (Zelda I, II, and LTTP) their dungeon was in Death Mountain. Link's Awakening, Link's only Game Boy adventure (currently) is in Tal Tal Mountains. At least we have something that broke one of the several trends running thru this classic series.", "summary": "Does Zelda 64 really live up to all that hype?", "unixReviewTime": 1193961600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2007", "reviewerID": "A1JLX0VQSN84BT", "asin": "B00000DMB3", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Ds Lite Miser", "reviewText": "this game is a real gem , treasure it and treat it well it is worth any price", "summary": "excellent", "unixReviewTime": 1178323200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2007", "reviewerID": "AZWKRO5BBSBEB", "asin": "B00000DMB3", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Didi", "reviewText": "Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is one of my favorite games ever!

Nay, I will go as far as to say perfect. Even if you haven't grown up with the Zelda series, you're still likely to find this game quite enjoyable. It's safe to say that this game was nothing short of revolutionary, and it continues to be one of my favorite video games of all time.\n\nThe story begins as a young Link awakens in a small tree hut. Staying true to past games, you start off with no items or weapons. You soon learn that the Great Deku Tree wishes to see Link, and thus you set out to explore Kokiri Forest. Upon taking your first steps outside, you meet the elfish inhabitants of the forest. While you search the area for a sword, you have time to get accustomed to the controls and the environment. Once you have sufficiently explored the forest and gathered the required items, you head for the Great Deku Tree, accompanied by your faerie friend Navi. After completing this first dungeon, the Deku Tree explains the history of the Triforce and rewards Link with the Spiritual Stone of the Forest, thus setting the story in motion.\n\nThe graphics of this game are fantastic for its time. You can now journey through a fully navigable 3D map. The details of the environment properly capture the mood of each setting, be it a forest village, a watery temple, a haunted underground maze, or the inside of a giant fish's belly. The map of Hyrule is pretty expansive and full of places and objects to explore. The cinematic sequences look great and tie the segments of the story together well.\n\nI absolutely love the controls in this game. Everything is pretty intuitive: the A Button is used to execute actions, the B Button swings your sword, and the C Buttons allow you to store up to three items to use during play. You're able to roll and jump, swim and climb, block attacks, stab, and build up power for swing attacks. But the greatest addition to the control features is the Z Targeting ability. This function allows you to lock on to people and enemies and focus a particular action on the targeted object. Moreover, this button will focus the camera directly behind Link, allowing you to have control over your point of view. To this day, I compare games' camera controls to Ocarina of Time, often wishing for that very desirable Z Targeting capability. A great addition to your supply of character controls.\n\nThe story itself builds upon previous games in the series, for we interact with familiar characters like Zelda and Ganondorf in addition to many new individuals. As always, there are a whole variety of weapons and items to collect during your travels, some that are familiar and some that are new to this title. What makes this game even more engaging is the idea of traveling through time. You begin the story as a child, growing as a warrior and searching for the Spiritual Stones. When you travel into the future, the world has become darker and your missions more challenging. There is a constant interplay between the past and the present as you try to make your way through the dungeons and numerous side quests. The multitude of puzzles, games, and items to collect makes this story very immersive and entertaining. The endearing characters that you meet provide for a rich, enjoyable plot, furthering your adventure along with their dialogue and aid.\n\nAnd the game would not be complete without sound. Again, Ocarina of Time gains a perfect score here. The sounds that Link makes when he fights, moves, and interacts with others are both enjoyable and believable. The echoes that your character makes are varied depending on what type of environment he is in. Likewise, the soundtrack is just as appropriate. Each level has a different musical score, and each song blends in beautifully with the surroundings. Also, some of the songs are familiar tunes from the previous games, transformed just right for a sound that is nostalgic, yet new. The ocarina songs are appealing as well, adding another interesting component to the gameplay. Ocarina of Time really has a wonderful soundtrack, and even today I still enjoy listening to it.\n\nAll in all, this game is truly a classic, and yet another impressive sequel in the Zelda series. From the sensible controls to the superb storyline to the awesome soundtrack, Ocarina of Time is a gem in the adventure game genre.", "summary": "Extraordinary!

Now you have no home and have to move to a place called the Kokiri Forest. This is a place where people never grow up and aren't allowed to leave the forest. They're called the Kokiri. But you're different. You really don't belong in this forest, instead you belong out in a world called Hyrule. You're a Hylian (normal people who actually grow up). You're out there to defeat Ganondorf. Ganondorf, most likely the person who killed your mother, is a strong and evil person who wants to take over Hyrule and become the King. The only person that can stop him is you (Link). Now the question is, will you be able to defeat the mean and evil Ganondorf and save the world of Hyrule?\n\nIf you think (or know) you can take that responsibility, then I suggest that you buy this game along with the N64 (if you don't have one) and experience something very special.

It should be played by every Nintendo fan and fans who are not big on Nintendo.  The Zelda series is infact a big popular series but this one defys all of them.  Ocarina of Time is a stand alone Zelda classic.  It is not only the best Zelda game but it is possibly the greatest game ever created on a console.  The story line is oh so brilliant and the graphics(even for todays standard) are unbelievable.  Anyone who owns a Nintendo 64 needs this game.  This game is pretty old and pretty cheap(I lost my game so I baught one for 5 bucks at Gamestop)so it won't be hard to find.  This game infact shows what the Nintendo 64 is capable of.  The game is very well made as you play through a huge world...well not that huge..  And I will say this..(I may be exagerating this though) But the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has one of the best \"boss battle finale\" ending ever..Ubelievable..Graphics in this game a superb.  There were parts in the game were I would just stand there and stare at the ocean, houses anything cause it looked so beautiful.  I loved how they created the bosses especially the last one and it was amazing how realistic they made the horse look.  Nintendo scores big with the graphics.  The gameplay is magneficent.  I loved how it was all made and done.  I really can't get into this one, you'll just have to play this part for yourself....The sound is..My god...It's beautiful I even downloaded all the songs.  I loved the song were your in the temple and you get the Mastersword cause they made that song really well.  The music in the farm were Epona is was made extreamly well and was just BRILLIANT!  As I've stated the story in this game is just plain good, though it obviously has the \"save\" themed plot as you all know and I won't really get into the plot since there is already like 500 reviews saying what the plot is about..Sure the game is old and outdated, I guess..But so what..The game is still one of the greatest games of all time.  I'll put it in simple words for you, the game is flawless!  The game has an amazing plot that will suck you in, the gameplay is fun and classic(as well as riding Epona the horse)and music is just plain beautiful, the enviroments and atmosphere of the game as just as incredible as the game itself is and as I stated before...Ocarina of Time is simply the greatest video game ever made(and if it's not possible then it has hands down the best video game ever made, no the best video game OF ALL TIME)....Get this game you will not regret it!\n\n5 out of 5!!!!(if I could I would give it 100000 out of 5)", "summary": "The greatest game of all time", "unixReviewTime": 1101859200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2004", "reviewerID": "A2DX5Z1OZKUB8P", "asin": "B00000DMB3", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "dark twain", "reviewText": "I've beaten the game 20 times and I'm still not bored of playing it.

Both games have been remade for the GameCube, and I own both the original N64 version and the GameCube version. The gameCube versions were released if you bought a GameCube at a certain time and if you pre-ordered the Wind Waker.\n\nTHE LEGEND OF ZELDA: OCARINA OF TIME\nThis game started out as you as the \"Hero of Time\". You were the only forest child without a fairy, and the Great Deku Tree sent the annoying little fairy to you. When you go to the Deku Tree, he says you must get these Spiritual Stones to open the Door of Time, and a bunch of other crap like that.\n\nSound and Music: 9.5/10.0 This game has one of the best scores in the video game world, and the ocarina songs are very good. 100% credit to the music makers of all the Zelda Games, these are some great songs. The only problem is you can't shut it off. Sometimes it gets annoying, and it doesn't help if you are stuck on a level for hours.\n\nGraphics: 2004: 4.0/10.0 1998: 9.0/10.0 In this day in age the graphics are so good these look like horrible. If this game was released today, everyone would laugh. Back in 1998, these graphics were the best out there. But the good thing about them is you can see the faces unlike some of those games fromt hat time it made you go blind.\n\nDifficulty: 10.0/10.0 This game is HARD! I beat it barely without a strategy guide, and you can be stuck on levels like the Forest Temple and the freaking Water Temple for MONTHS. If you beat the game with a strategy guide, you take the challenge and fun out of it. You also won't have many broken items, like controllers or TV's.\n\nGameplay: 1,000,000.0/ 10.0 It is considered the best game ever, and was the 1998 Game Of The Year. You could do EVERYTHING in this game, and it is very fun doing all those side quests and other crap. This game is like no other. No other game can match this, none of that Final Fantasy or any other RPG match it, it is the best Nintendo game ever made.\n\nTHE LEGEND OF ZELDA: MAJORA'S MASK\nThe game takes a huge turn in Majoras Mask as young Link goes out with Epona from Hyrule. No Ganondorf's in this game, because it revolves around Majora's Mask, a mask stolen by this little imp from the Happy Mask Shop guy from OOT. You have three days to get the mask back, but you must keep going back using the Ocarina and the Song of Time.\n\nSound and Music: 9.5/ 10.0 It is like a carbon copy of Ocarina of Time, and the suspensful music is very catchy. The game has great music, ALL ZELDA GAMES HAVE GREAT MUSIC.\n\nGraphics: Same As Ocarina of Time\n\nDifficulty: 9.5/10.0 Not as bad as Ocarina of Time, but that doesn't mean it is not frustrating and challenging. You can't be scared away by the challenge of these games because they are just too great.\n\nGameplay: 10.0/10.0 The whole mask collecting concept is very fun and it a change from beating Ganondorf like in all the other games. You will feel deja vu of Ocarina of Time because the characters are the same, just different. The game is fun and a great challenge.

Around this field are pathways which lead off to various different locations such as dungeons, castles, villages, volcanoes, etc... Each path will lead to usually one destination like a castle, and once explored, you travel back across Hyrule field and visist another pathway which leads to a different location. This makes areas more accessible, and it makes backtracking as less tedius as possible, due to the fact that you're not endessly travelling through pre-explored ares. Backtracking is an important feature of OOT, due to the fact that when you progress through the game you aquire objects which give you the ability to explore areas more thoroughly ... bombs for instance blow up walls that hide secret paths. Hockshots give you the ability to ascend to higher ledges. The Ocarina of Time opens secret doors. Thus, pre explored areas which you thought were unimportant can in fact conceal the most important instruments and dungeons in the game. This is compounded, when at one point in the game you aquire the Master Sword. This is a special sword which, upon claiming, makes you and the world age by seven years, and by doing the reverse, putting the sword back in it's mold, makes you and the world 7 years younger. The good thing about this is that the past and future are profoundly different. The future is controlled by evil, whereas the past is controled by good. Needless to say, your mission in the game is to liberate peice by peice the future world from the evil Ganondolf. However, in order to do so you must travel back and forth in time creating situations which will have an impact on the future world.\n\nA main part of this game is the ocarina of time. Depending on what tune you play, the ocarina will turn night in to day, make it rain, open secret doors, or make blocks disappear, amoung other things.  This adds an important layer to the game, for you have to use your brain in order to work out which song is necessary to progress. For instance, after spending hours wondering what to do, the idea could suddenly hit you, \"Should I play Zelda's Lullaby in front of the waterfall?\" If successful, the waterfall will stop and a passageway will display itself, thus giving you a tremendous satisfied feeling. The actual songs you learn in the game are some of the best songs in computer game history. In fact, only Computer World by Kraftswerk can compare to the greatness of the music in OOT.\n\nBy the time Zelda: OOT was released the difficulty in games was just perfect. Your heart was racing when you met a worthy adversary, you were fustrated when you died, you were delighted when you succeeded. Fustration and anger are both necessary in games because it's those feelings which make you truly delighted when you succeed...

When you feel like the character, you just can't stop playing, even in the boring parts (in other words, the Water and Fire Temples). The different times you play and the many secrets hidden (I mean it, many secrets, I highly doubt you can get them all!) makes the game even greater, even more perfect.\n- Educative: I really don't know why this game is rated E for Everyone... I feel like the game has some scary parts (in other words, the cemitery and the Shadow Temple), so it should be rated T for Teen, even though it has no great violence, no red blood (just green blood sometimes). But you parents shouldn't worry about that. This beauty must be taken to your children.\nOverall, there's nothing to say. I don't know what you're doing reading my review if you haven't played this game yet. This is one of those games you must beat during your lifetime (The Wind Waker, the last game in the series, is very good, but it isn't nearly as good as Ocarina Of Time). It might take a long time for you to beat it if you're always busy, because the game is not short, but you must try. It'll be an unforgettable experience to be Link in Hyrule.", "summary": "Best Game Ever?", "unixReviewTime": 1065916800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "08 7, 2003", "reviewerID": "A1OZ5AQ5A0N9YO", "asin": "B00000DMB3", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "reviewText": "This is one of the best games I have ever played.

As a prequel to the entire Legend of Zelda series, it has caught heavy anticipation. Ocarina is a prequel to the events before A Link to the Past. Link is a child, whose destiny is to save the land of Hyrule from Ganon (Gannondorf here) by traveling through time. You'll meet up with other characters in the adventure and interact will fellow Hylians, Kokiri, Zoras, and other civilations who aid you on your quest to save Hyrule. Ocarina of Time is one of those controversial games that the series has carried all along. In the end, the game is an Action/RPG, and should never be classified in the style of traditional, turn-based RPG's (like Final Fantasy).\nNew additions to the series are automatic jumping and Z-targeting. The emphasis of the Zelda games has always been puzzle-solving and dungeon arrangement. You also build your attributes, receiving items including the Ocarina, learning songs whose purposes range from teleporting to opening doors to time traveling. Along with mini-games, hidden items and side quests equal, its a worthwhile experience. Graphics-wise, Hyrule never looked better and most effects in Ocarina of Time are outstanding. No need for sharp visuals and smooth framerates, but rather focus on detail and designer talent. The real-time cutscenes and the passing of day and night are impressive. The sound also holds its own on this cartridge format. The themes of Zora's Domain and Gerudo Valley are music to the ears. Zelda fans will remember tunes of Kakariko Village and Zelda's Lullaby. A big plus is that all the sound effects from previous Zelda games have made a comeback.\nIn the end, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time makes the cut. Even though the gameplay consists mainly of dungeon-dwelling and puzzle-solving, the impressive graphics, quality sound and everything that's been obtained from previous Zelda titles will keep fans and non-fans alike entertained.

Weidman", "reviewText": "A Good game comes along, entertaining millions of fans worldwide. Then, a year later another good game comes along and steals the fisrt ones place. Ever since the beginning of game history, every good game that came out eventually got replaced by a better game the next year. Since Sept. 98, that cycle has been broken, stopped by one game that never got replaced, even by it's sequals, nothing ever ended out better than Zelda: Ovarina of Time. This game has revolutionized 3D gaming with its Z-Target system. It has enchanted and bewildered people with its magnificant storyline. It has taken the lives of thousands of people because of all the side-quests and collectible items in it. This game, I am predicting, will probably still rain supreme until the next system comes out (The one after gamecube). Its Z-Targeting system makes Link (the main character) look at an enemy, within this looking, he can circle around it in stategic patterns, accurately aim and strike the sword without missing and hitting air a yard away, and eaily and quickly dodge and backflip attacks. Many games, even nowadays, imitate this system, but fail to get it as correct and perfect as Zelda did/does. The storyline starts off telling of a magical forest with many never-growing children in it. All these children have one compainon fairy with them, except one boy, who does not. Right from hearing this setence in the game for the first time, you know your in for an adventurous, complicated yet slightly realistic storyline that will take your life for at least a month. And, this game has many, many side quests to do. There are 100 special spiders to defeat and get treasures with, 50 magic beans to be planted and give a passegeway to unaccesible areas, 25 heart pecies to collect to get a whole lot of health with, 15 masks to sell and play around with, 6 empty bottles to collect, a chicken to rais, and a huge trading sidequest that eventually leads to the possesion of the strongest weapon in the game. And much more. This game also has the perfect sound to it. The cheerfull, happy nature of the magical forest can be perfectly heard in it's background music. The adventurous, wide and far meadows of hyrule feild are perfectly expressed in it's background song. The fast-paced and action-packed lives of the desert theives is clearly expressed in it's song. Everywhere you turn in this game, you are greeted with a new background song that sings perfectly the attributes and unique features of that place, and transations perfectly with whatever the player/link might be doing in that place. This game's sequal, Majoras Mask, suffered horribly from the lack of this. And the prevous games in the series didn't meet this either. One more thing though, I'll admit it to the world, I hate the main Zelda theme. I'm glad its not in Ocarina of Time, In a game that so clearly stands out with it's music, one old sounding, bland song that dosnt fir well with hyrule feild wouv'dv ruined the experience of going out of kokiri forest and seeing it for the first time. Oh, I forot to mention that part too, the game has a perfect attidude for adventure in it. The places are designed very well, and when mixed in with the fabulous background music, gives a feeling of adventure that is completely unparelled to any other game, whatsoever. The first moment you walk out of the small and cramped kokiri forest, which actually used to seem so big, onto the your first grasses of hyrule feild, the sun will blind the screen for a moment, and as rising, reveal this spectacular, wide open feild with a tuft of trees, a monstor here and there, a ranch in the middle, and a clear blue sky with a brightly shining sun. Along the feild, a rise in elevation starts, as you climb the hill, you can see even more than you could before, a magestic, huge catsle, a winding clear blue river, a deep valley, a menancing volcanoe, and a huge lake, along with a tuft of trees, and a monstor here and there. As you travel to new places, you will feel almost the exact same feeling of adventure too, when seeing the towering windmill of Kakariko village above the small, humble houses of the village below it, with the perfect backgrond music for example. With this great feeling of adventure, huge enviroments, much huger than even the ones of nowaday games, and a great storyline and absolutly stunning soundtrack, Ocarina of Time is the Greatest game of all time, until a greater game will come out, wich will probably take a very very long time.

From the amazing graphics (for what it is; a N64 game), to the music, to the challenging gameplay, to the engulfing storyline, the \"Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\" is a must-play for any age. You start the game off as young Link (or whatever you want to call him), who lives in an enchanted forest where young never grow old. Inside the forest, there is a godly tree, who could be considered to be infinitly wise. The tree senses Link has the power to overthrow a great evil which is arising, and tests him to the dungeon inside of him. Link comes out, sucessful, and the tree tells him the story of the great evil which is arising. From then on, you play young Link, and must overcome many obstacles. As a child, there are 3 dungeons, and the tree's counts as one, so you're making some time, right? WRONG. There's much more to this game then beating dungeons. As a child, you can't acess as many of the things, but after you advance 7 years to the future and attain the Master Sword, many of these things are then open to you. As a child, you got an ocarina, in which you must learn songs on to access special places or do special things. Now, you can do all those things, and more. My personal favorite is Epona's song, in which you place a horse's (Epona) song, and it comes to you, in which you can ride across Hyrule Field to get to places twice as fast. As a child, you have weapons like a stick (whoopey), a sword, a shield, a sling-shot, and Duku Nuts. As an adult, you can handle 2 swords: the Master Sword, and the Giant Sword, which is so big you must handle it with 2 hands, which means no shield. You also have the hook-shot, Megaton Hammer, bow-and-arrows, and magic crystals you can do different things with. I cannot begin to explain how amazing this game is. I'd buy a Nintendo 64 all over again just for this. Now I have a Playstation 2, and I still have my Nintendo 64, but only play two games on it; this, of course, and Super Smash Brothers.

Lot of areas just drop that \"wow factor\", like when you first enter Zora's Domain or the game's many cutscenes.\nSound: Although there's no voice, except for Navi's annoying \"Hey!\" and an occasional \"Hello\" from her or Link's grunts, it's got some awesome music.

The Zelda franchise has always been among the best to grace any video game system, and with the power of the soon-to-be-released Nintendo 64, the series was finally going to reach its next step: the third dimension. This (along with other titles like Super Mario 64 and Mario Kart 64) got both gamers and the press excited about the N64 and the upcoming Zelda game. While the Nintendo 64 never quite managed to live up to all its prerelease hype, The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time managed to not only live up to its respected hype, but in many ways surpass it.\nWhat makes TOOT special IMO is the fact that it is the first game (that I've played) where you truly feel like a part of its world. Many games tried hard to accomplish this feat, including previous Zelda titles, but TOOT was the first game to finally get it right. Even the later Majora's Mask never quite managed to create the immersive world TOOT did.\nMuch of the game's feeling stems from the interactivity of its world. You can spend hours exploring a certain area and still have not seen everything there is to see. For example, many of the game's locations have these hidden holes you can jump into and find hidden goodies (as well as hear some pretty haunting music). Once you obtain the Stone Of Agony, however, you find out that these randomly placed secrets are only the beginning. I won't go into too much detail here since you need to play the game for yourself to really appreciate it. Another thing that makes this game feel more realistic than previous Zeldas is character interaction. Remember how decidedly generic a lot of the NPCs in Zeldas II and III were? In TOOT, each and every NPC is given at least some sort of personality so that you can easilly distinguish him/her from the rest of the game's characters as well as once again feel like you're a part of Hyrule. And of course, the third dimension (the dimension we live life through) helps the game a great deal.\nThe gameplay is equally great. I especially liked how you can hold three items at a time rather than just one, which is especially helpful in the game's dungeons which often require you to use several different weapons/items. Speaking of which, the dungeons have some of the most clever puzzles and interesting layouts of any game I had ever played. And I really liked how once you completed all the puzzles in a dungeon, you opened a new path from its starting point straight to the final boss, rather than simply having to run through the entire dungeon all over again after death the way you did in previous Zeldas (this was especially annoying in A Link To The Past, where the dungeons were much longer and more challenging than in the original Legend of Zelda). And of course, the game's graphics are among the N64's best (not necessarely because of how detailed/realistic they are, but how carefully crafted and full of life they are), and the soundtrack is among the best ever to grace a video game (even with the Star Fox 64-quality midi samples).\nIn brief, The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time is an excellent game. If you own an N64 and have not already picked this game up, I strongly suggest you do. If you do not even own an N64, than the system's worth picking up just for this one game and its semi-sequal Majora's Mask.", "summary": "May Very Well Be The Finest Video Game Ever Released.", "unixReviewTime": 1018051200}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "2", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2002", "reviewerID": "A2FTUL0LYD21C6", "asin": "B00000DMB3", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Smantie", "reviewText": "THIS IS THE MOST ABSOLUTE SUPERIOR GAME EVER MADE!

One of the great conflicts in Nintendo history, second only to that of Mario and Bowser.  You start the quest as a boy and end up as a man.  Along the way, you will fight many monsters, explore dungeons and temples, rescue a horse (great for traveling through the world of Hyrule quickly), engage in numerous side quests and mini-games, learn many different tunes for your Ocarina, pick up a number of weapons and other helpful items, meet some gorgeous fairies, and in short, have a wonderful gaming experience.\nAs with the other Zelda games, this one is filled with different puzzles of various types, most of which you MUST complete in order to advance in the game.  They are engaging, but not too difficult to figure out, for the most part.  There are a few, though, that I had a tough time with.  Not to fear, though, there is plenty of help out there, both in books and on the internet, to aid you through those difficult spots.  The controls are wonderfully intuitive.  Navigating through Hyrule is much like controlling Mario in Super Mario 64 (and the game does, at times, suffer from awkward camera angles like Mario did), and there are good tutorials in the game itself that teach you the ins and outs of fighting monsters and defending yourself.\nThe Z-targeting system is excellent, once you get used to it.  You don't really need it for some of the early monsters, but by the time you become an adult, it will be essential.  In addition, you have a little fairy buddy, Navi, who continually travels with you and is always willing to give you helpful advice on what to do next after you complete a given task.  Navi will also help you with advice on the weak spots of the many different monsters you will encounter throughout the game.\nAs I mentioned before, there are a number of side quests throughout the game.  They're not essential to finish the game, but they are a lot of fun, and some of them will get you prizes that will make the later stages of the game a little easier.  One word of advice - when you reach Lake Hylia, be sure and talk to the two scarecrows!  Later in the game, you will be glad you did.  Also, be wary of purchasing too many items in the various shops and bazaars.  They have many useful items, but they are also VERY expensive, and almost everything in there can be found for free in various nooks and crannies in the game.  Also, be wary of Gorons who want to sell you a Giant Sword.  Don't say I didn't warn you...\nAlthough you do not NEED a Rumble Pak to play the game, your gaming experience will be enhanced if you get one.  The Pak will be set off whenever Link gets near a secret area, which are sprinkled liberally throughout Hyrule.  These secret areas contain goodies that you really don't want to miss out on.\nAll in all, an excellent game which showcases the abilities of the N64 to great effect.  Games like this are why I will always remain a Nintendo fan.  But, don't take my word for it - pick it up!

First off, it's more of an RPG/adventure combination, since it doesn't use conventional RPG techniques like turns or experience. But that is a good thing, because the way the game is structured allows for near-total freedom as you play it. Yes, like some people have said, you must beat the dungeons in a certain order, but there are about a million other things you can do whenever you want, and that just expands the boundaries of this game even more. It is truly the greatest game I have ever played, that is no exaggeration. The graphics and the sound are wonderful, the puzzles are NOT as easy as some people are saying -- the Water Temple is maddening! -- and the character development and depth of play is unmatched.\nMajora's Mask is almost as good, but what makes Ocarina of Time better, in my opinion, is the fact that it is sort of the \"ultimate\" Zelda game, meaning it starts from the beginning and recreates the entire story of Link and Zelda and Ganon, and it is a completely stand-alone and definitive game. Majora's Mask, on the other hand, takes place right after the events of Ocarina of Time and has a very different structure.

He lives in Kokiri Village, a little tiny village in the land of Hyrule.  Anyway, a little fairy named Navi comes and says that he must meet the Deku Tree.  He does and the Deku Tree tells him to go inside the Deku Tree and destroy all of the evil monsters inside him.  Link does this and the Deku Tree gives him the Kokiri Emerald, or the Spiritual Stone of Forest.  The Deku Tree phrophesies that Ganondorf, an evil desert Gerudo man, is trying to get hold of the Triforce, the essence of life in Hyrule.  But in order to get hold of the Triforce you have to get three of the spiritual stones.  Unfortuantely, after the tree's prophecy, he died because of the curse Ganondorf had cast upon him.  But Link and Navi go on their journey and get the Goron's Ruby, or Spiritual Stone of Fire and the Zora's Sapphire, or Spiritual Stone of Water.  Link gets the Ocarina of Time but when he opens the doors Ganondorf gets in before him and he gets the Triforce.  Link waits seven years in the Chamber of Time and when he awakes he's all grown up.  Rauru, the Sage of Light is there and tells him that he must save all the Sages from their temples and receive the medallions.

It has a fairly good story, it's interesting enough to make you want to know what happens next, and it has a gameplay that's unbeatable.  The combat system is very simple and great.  You have your z locking on system which makes killing enemies a piece of cake.  There is so much to do in this game that it's comaprable to a good RPG, something that N64 hasn't been blessed with yet.  The graphics are pretty good, especially since they don't use the expanssion pack, and the world is just huge.  One down side is that some puzzles in the caves can be pretty tough, and sometimes, you may feel lost and don't know what to do next. The bosses look very impressive and get more challenging as you progress through the game.  This game will defently take a couple months to beat, unless you play 24/7.  After you master the game, then it'll just take a couple of days, like any other normal, or great game.  Nintendo has defenetly done a great job with this one.

The story of Ocarina of Time involves going back and forth in time, between a happy peaceful Hyrule, and a dark evil one, much like ALTTP; but don't think this is a rip-off on its predecessor. The complex dungeons, challenging bosses, and deepening story lines will blow you away. The 3D element of the game also adds so much more that was never possible before. Even the music is catchy and well orchestrated.

HL takes an utterly unoriginal idea for either games or movies and crafts an utterly unstoppable gaming experience.  You play Gordon Freeman, who works in the bowels of an ultra-secret, underground research facility called \"The Black Mesa\".  (Having played the game yet I'm still not sure what's supposed to be going on in BM - it's what happens that matters.)  Oozing high-tech, the facility is host to another dimension when you/Freeman accidentally...do something that tears a whole in the fabric of our own - allowing beings from that other world to enter ours.\n\nNow, if you think that these otherworldly denizens are peaceful beings intent on fostering cross-dimensional love, or that your fellow human beings will enter the Black Mesa unarmed intent on warmly welcoming these beings to our world, I'm afraid you've picked up the wrong game entirely.  For in the bowels of \"Black Mesa\" you'll confront howling dog things, flying crabs, alien-zombified versions of your colleagues, gigantic aliens that breathe fire through their fists, aliens that hang from ceilings (and entrap their victims using these vine-looking things) and squads of human special forces troops intent on killing everything that moves.  If the above attracts you because you think it may be the setting that elevates the nobility of the human existence, I should warn you to look elsewhere - for in \"Half Life\", you'll find yourself acting indiscriminately with a 9mm automatic, a submachine gun, grenades and (most regrettably of all) a nasty crowbar; you'll make few friends and find yourself (for the most part) alone and (not infrequently) exiled to ventilation ducts (again with the ducts!!) to avoid getting shot at by humans, or burned, bitten, bolted or tongue-bathed by aliens.  Complex problem solving skills (as much as marksmanship or bullet-saving) are crucial in this game - in which your enemies have above-average levels of AI.  There are unfortunately times when a level may be hung up by the failure to achieve some specific mission-goal, but this is on the whole a game in which the goals are sufficiently complex to make you feel cool for achieving them, yet not so complex as to be impossible to solve.

Just long hallways, small rooms, and an occasional elevator shaft that you  climb up. I like 3D games that let you be outside, looking over vast plains  of enemies and obstacles. Half-Life just didn't cut it in this  arena.\nAnother thing that I found most disturbing was the extreme  gore/violence that is present throughout the game. When your science  project goes wrong, you walk out to find a scientist lying on the ground  with about 10 gallons of blood spread all over the walls and floor! Were  the programmers just trying to be sick here or what? When you reach the  levels in which you begin to fight the army grunts (who are the best  enemies), it gets even more grotesque. If you let off an entire clip of  bullets at one guy, expect to see a wall covered with blood. Sure, you can  turn it off, but it does very little good. The blood is still very  disturbing. This is one aspect of the game that is extremely unacceptable.  I am not a parent saying this, either, I'm a teenager.\nAside from the  violence and lack of interesting levels, the game is pretty much void of  any lasting qualities.

The music is very enjoyable to listen to, and Crash isn't full of the 'tude that most video game mascots in the 90's had.\n\nThe gameplay and controls are really nice, however the jumping and spin hover physics can get a little wonky sometimes.\n\nBut what really chaps my ass are the non-platforming levels. This game tries to add some variety by including jetskiing, motorcycling, and flying levels. The control in the motorcycle levels is too tight and its hard to make sharp turns. The flying levels are extremely frustrating because the enemy fighters can drain half of your health in one go, and there are a limited number of health powerups.\nThankfully, these are only about 5 total of each of these levels.\n\nThis is one of the best Playstation games ever, and I recommend it to all owners.", "summary": "The best of the series, but not perfect.", "unixReviewTime": 1437523200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2015", "reviewerID": "AKJZB7XUZIWMU", "asin": "B00000DMAR", "reviewerName": "Ellen Conrad", "reviewText": "I bought this for my son.

This game was released in 1998 and was once again, developed by Naughty Dog, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and distributed by Universal Interactive Studios. It was originally a PlayStation exclusive but was later re-released as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store.\n The games story takes place immediately after the events of the second game in which the ruins of the Cortex Vortex come crashing down to Earth and lands on a temple unleashing an evil entity known as Uka Uka who is Aku Akus evil twin brother; Aku Aku is the mask that helped Crash out in the first two games. Uka Uka joins with Doctor Neo Cortex and Doctor Nefarious Tropy as they plan to gather Crystals in their original places in time and use their energy to enslave the Earth.\n The game is once again a platformer with pretty much the same kind of controls as the second game. You can not only play as Crash but also as his sister Coco who was a supporting character in the second game. You travel back and forward in time to gather the 25 Crystals from the previous game in their original places in time before the enemy does; but don't worry, the levels are completely different from each the second game. The game takes place in the Time-Twisting Machine which acts as the hub area of the game. The machine is split into five chambers with only the first chamber being available at the start. Each chamber has five buttons that open portals to different levels. The goal is the same as the second game; obtain the crystal hidden in the area. Some crystals can be obtained in the middle of the level or by completing a certain task such as winning a race. The gems are also back and can only be obtained by destroying all the boxes, or completing a hidden level or task. Once you obtain the five crystals in a chamber, a sixth button will appear that warps you to a boss who will fight you in order to get the crystals back. By defeating the boss, the next chamber will become available to play. By defeating a boss you unlock a new power, theres the Super Slam which makes your body slam more powerful, the double jump, a tornado twister which lets you glide for a short period, a bazooka launcher which can be used to destroy crates or enemies or collect fruit and one ups and the running shoes which allow you to sprint.\n The newest main feature in the game is the Relics which can only be retrieved in a time trail mode for every level in the game. After you obtain a levels crystal, you can go back to the level and collect the yellow clock at the beginning to start a time trail. The goal is to reach the end as fast as you can, but there are some differences: There are yellow time boxes that when destroyed will stop the clock for a short period of time, there are no checkpoint boxes so if you die, you have to start the level from the beginning; but there are plenty of Aku Aku masks to help you and thats pretty much it. It proves to be very challenging and getting the Platinum relics is insanely difficult and even I never managed to get all of them.\n This game proves to be the best one in the entire series and one of my favorite games overall, period. I would highly recommend getting this game off the PlayStation Store for $6, this is a MUST PLAY. It really is one of the best.\nFINAL RATING:  10 out of 10", "summary": "It's awesome", "unixReviewTime": 1395014400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 30, 2014", "reviewerID": "AE203EP4EE7XI", "asin": "B00000DMAR", "reviewerName": "Anonymous0559", "reviewText": "I'm so glad I was able to buy this game at a great price.

The first Crash Bandicoot and Wrath of Cortex for the PS1. I played a demo for Warped on my Spyro the dragon game and wanted it ever since. I bought it on Amazon and its safe for me to say that...THIS IS THE CRASH I KNOW AND LOVE!^_^\n\n For those who don't know Crash Bandicoot first came out in the 90's as a standard, straight-forward platformer. You're a mutated Bandicoot named Crash who escapes from the evil mad scientist Dr. Neo Cortex and must go back to save your girlfriend. In Warped Dr. Cortex now works for Uka Uka (The brother of Aku Aku) an evil mask that wants to destroy crash and take over the world. He instructs Cortex to go through time and collect Crystals and Gems that hold extreme power. Crash has to literally race through time and jump, spin, and dance his way through time to retrieve them before Cortex gets ahold of them.\n\n This game is just as fun as the first one. It brought me back to a time where video games concentrated more on gameplay and content rather than graphics which games today seem to concentrate almost too much on. The controls are spot on. You can build momentum for jumps, move in any direction, and really I never had problems with the controls even in the first Crash. One thing I REALLY love about this one is that I don't feel bad when I die! This game has some really interesting death scenes rather you're forcibly kissed by a frog that changes into a prince, eaten by lions, thrown into the screen by a two-headed fat person, or so on. When I finish the game I plan on seeing how many ways I can die:) Some worlds replicate each other but are harder and take more and more skill to get through. The boss battles are really diverse and take strategy, timing, and skill to get rid of. I must confess I found the first boss and 2 worlds extremely easy. Its not until the 3 that the game just goes \"F*** this! I'm gonna make your time a living hell\"! Its still way easy so far compared to the first game though which really did what I said above. I also noticed something that first caught my attention in Wrath of Cortex. The game seems extremely open when it comes to lives. Seriously I'm not even half way through the game and all ready up to 50 almost. I guess I'm that good at playing. Im definately buying the second one.\n\n I admit I'm disappointed at the way the turn the series have made. I wish they kept it as a patformer and just added maybe some adventure elelments to it like they did Twinsanity (even though its glitchy as hell). Naughty Dog where did you go? Crash Bandicoot Warped is just what I expected it to be.

The original three on the Playstation were good, and the ones that would follow were always decent. I went back to play this classic and discovered it was just as great as I remembered. Still, it does have its low points.\n\nGraphics- 8/10\nOn the original Playstation, these graphics were fairly good. The characters look blocky at points, but it sort of adds to the appeal. Voice syncing is pretty well done. Levels and characters are interestingly designed. The fact that most levels have another level that looks similar doesn't really bother me. They change the levels up enough to where it feels like you are playing a different level.\n\nStory- 3/10\nThis is the part of the game that is a huge letdown. Neo Cortex, our antagonist, starts the game off exactly like he was left on the second game...falling from the sky. After failing to stop Crash Bandicoot from capturing all of the powerful Crystals, he plummets from his exploding spaceship and falls into a mountain. Inside of the mountain just so happens to be Uka Uka, a powerful witch mask that appears to have been giving Cortex orders all along. Uka Uka was trapped in the mountain by Aku Aku to keep the world safe. Now Uka Uka has escaped with Cortex. Uka Uka quickly recruits Dr. N. Trophy to build him a time machine so he can find the Crystals before Crash Bandicoot was even around.\n\nThis honestly doesn't sound too bad. Until you see Crash and his friends at home. Aku Aku hears Uka Uka's evil laugh and senses danger. Then you suddenly appear at the time machine that Cortex is using and now you are using it. What happened to Cortex? I have no idea. How did you find your way there? Who knows? From there you use the time machine to get to the Crystals before Cortex.\n\nSound- 8/10\nI love the music in this game. Every level type has different music, and it works for every level. If you are in an underwater level, you will hear mysterious sounding music. They just did the music very well. The voice acting is top notch as well. Sound effects are the same old Crash Bandicoot sounds though. It's not the best video game sound, but it's still really good.\n\nGameplay- 9/10\nGameplay can make or break a game. Luckily the Gameplay made this game. They added more variety than any of the previous games in the series.\n\nCrash Bandicoot is basically a side-scroller except the camera is behind Crash instead on the side. You are still on a fixed path that you have to follow. Sometimes you will even enter a part of the stage that is a side-scroller. The gameplay has always work very well like this.\n\nWarped is the third game in the series though, and they needed to add something new. They did just that by adding: Power Ups, Flying levels, underwater levels, jet-ski levels, and motorcycle racing levels. Power ups are gained whenever you defeat a boss. You get small things like double jump and belly flop at first. Later on you'll get a Laser Guided Bazooka and Running Shoes, which really change up the gameplay. One thing that I am happy about is that the Power Ups actually help you play the game. They aren't just useless add-ons\n\nThe new level types are just what this game series needed. The underwater levels play like a side-scroller underwater. It's enjoyable to swim around instead of walking. Jet Ski and Motorcycle levels are great vehicle levels. I admit that the controls on the Motorcycle levels take some getting used to, but that is what makes it fun. The flying levels are probably the coolest new things. There are only three in the entire game. You fly around in a plane and shoot down opposing planes. There isn't much to it, but it's a nice break from the other levels.\n\nDifficulty- 5/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)\nThis game is extremely easy. You can go through the entire game without dying. Not just that, but the entire game only consists of around 3-4 hours of your time. One strong afternoon of playing, and you'll be done. The bosses on this game can become a little difficult, but it only takes a few minutes to learn their pattern. Also, I felt the final boss battle was too easy.\n\nOverall- 7/10\nThe gameplay is extremely strong. The story for this game is just all out of whack. If you are looking for a quick game to pick up and play, this is for you. I suggest checking out the previous two titles first though.

I am, however, incredibly surprised to find that Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is actually a really fun adventure game that may have been slightly overlooked at the time of its release because of the seemingly never-ending amount of wonderful games released for the Playstation in 1998.\n\nJust so you know, I can't compare Warped to Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back because I haven't played that one.  I can only compare Warped to the original Crash Bandicoot.\n\nBefore playing Crash 3, I was almost CERTAIN that Crash Bandicoot was an overrated video game character because my first and only exposure to Crash was the very first game.  I thought for sure Crash Bandicoot was either a Mario or an Earthworm Jim rip-off, and didn't deserve all the attention it got.\n\nFor 10 years the original was the only Crash Bandicoot game I knew, and truth be told, it was a pretty average game because every stage featured basically the same uninspiring, repetitive island environment where the object was to run to the end of every stage collecting berries and smashing all the boxes as a way to earn more lives and receive a better overall percentage.\n\nSimply put, Crash's very first outing was BORING.  It desperately needed variety.  Walking through island/jungle stages all the time can only provide so much fun before it inevitably gets boring.  The creators of Crash Bandicoot must have realized how boring this formula was because Warped does just the opposite- Warped features nothing BUT creativity.  In Warped every stage certainly does NOT have the same feel.  You will encounter something drastically different in every stage.  I like that.\n\nThe main objective of Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is to find the purple gem found in each of the 25 stages of the game.  You HAVE to find all 25 purple gems otherwise the game won't allow you to fight the boss at the end of the world you're in.  For example, if you're in World 4, and can't find the purple gem in stage 3, you won't be allowed to face the boss at the end of that world.  You're stuck there until you find that darn purple gem.  Once you find the gem, and face and defeat the boss, you move on to the next world and repeat the process of collecting one purple gem per level and face the boss.  By the way, there's 5 worlds total and 5 stages in each world.  That comes to 25 stages total.\n\nThe amount of creativity that went into each of the 25 stages is simply incredible.  Unlike the first Crash Bandicoot game where you mainly just spin around through a jungle environment breaking boxes and jumping over cracks in the ground, Warped offers a LOT more in the way of variety.  In Warped you will encounter a few motorcycle racing stages (where you're required to get first place so you can receive the purple gem), a couple underwater stages (with VERY neat-looking backgrounds and deadly, puffy fish swimming about), a couple levels where you're steering an airplane and required to shoot down blimps and other airplanes, and not to mention those tricky, tiger-riding stages.\n\nOh, and I HAVE to mention the ultra-cool futuristic robot stages (which require near-perfect jumping patterns in order to complete).  The Jet Ski stages are really fun because you're located on top of the ocean and I guarantee you will have the time of your life jumping over ramps while avoiding those floating bombs.  Yup, it's awesome.  This is what makes Crash Bandicoot 3 so great- you won't know WHAT to expect until you enter the level.\n\nProbably the worst thing about Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is the fact that the game offers little in the way of challenge.  That's not to say the game is a cakewalk, either.  People who think Warped is an easy game are only comparing the challenge to the previous two Crash Bandicoot games.  If you compare Warped to say, I don't know, Spyro the Dragon, it's not such an easy game then.  It's definitely not a hard game either.  You WILL beat it.  I think the challange is comparable to Super Mario Bros. 1, the old NES classic.\n\nThe one thing I find challenging in Warped is the boss battle in World 3 where you're required to jump over bombs and laser beams heading in your direction.  This is one case where practice doesn't necessarily make perfect.  Also the second airplane stage can be a challenge if you don't bother shooting down the enemy planes.\n\nOne thing about Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped that IS incredibly easy is the object of finding those purple gems.  Most of the time you can NOT miss those gems, because you basically walk right into them on your way to reaching the end of the stage.  I mean, they are always RIGHT THERE.  RIGHT in front of you!\n\nAfter you complete a stage, you can always go back to it and the computer will then give you a new option to complete the level in a certain amount of time.  Finishing the stage in a certain amount of time is actually quite hard.  It means you *really* have to take off running and not stop for a single moment to smash a box or spin-attack an enemy or ANYTHING.  It means you have to run run RUN!  Just so you know, completing the stages under a certain time is NOT a requirement.  It's entirely up to you if you'd like to accept the challenge.  I'm too much of a wimp to accept it, personally.\n\nI like how you can save your game after you complete a stage.  You can actually complete one stage and go to the save room, if you wish.  Very convenient.  Oh, and get this- if during the middle of the game you decide you want to stop playing and shut off the Playstation, when you come back to the game later all the lives you collected up to that point will STILL be there!  I can't think of any other game that will save all the lives you collect.  Speaking of lives, they are *so easy* to find in Warped that you probably can collect up to 45 of them.  That's a lot, and you will probably need them because, even though the challenge ranges from low to medium, your first time through the game won't be THAT simple.\n\nWhen Crash gets hit or smashed by something, I think it's funny the way he yells \"whoa!\"  It reminds me of that comedian Carrot Top.\n\nThe reason Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped isn't going to receive a 5-star rating from me is because of the same problem found in Spyro the Dragon- in the flying stages (in this case, the airplane stages) when you hit down on the D-pad the airplane flies UP, and hitting up will make the airplane go DOWN.  The game company made the direction the wrong way!  Oops.  At least when you steer the airplane left, it will go left.  The same with right.  Unfortunately, many game makers have made, and continue to make, the same mistake.  It needs to be corrected once and for all.\n\nI realize having your airplane fly up when you hit \"down\" on the d-pad is an example of realism since that's more or less how REAL airplanes operate, but the thing is, Crash Bandicoot isn't supposed to be about realism since it's just a platform adventure game, and furthermore, it still doesn't change the fact that up and down are reversed.  This adds unncessary frustration and challenge in learning something that definitely feels backwards.\n\nThere's a toxic underwater stage in Donkey Kong Country 3 where the controls are reversed as a way to add challenge, and in my mind at least, having the controls reversed when trying to operate the airplane in this game definitely falls under the same category of unnecessary challenge.\n\nI hope you buy this game for your Sony Playstation and experience a fun time.", "summary": "Crash's best game", "unixReviewTime": 1156118400}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "4", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2005", "reviewerID": "AA50ZQDY2TPK5", "asin": "B00000DMAR", "reviewerName": "Aaron", "reviewText": "Crash Bandicoot: Warped = Orange, cool, creative, fuzzy, neat, great graphics, awesome design, introduction of secret levels for the series, power-ups, new bosses (including a big boss), and a new playable character.

One of those titles was WCW/nWo Revenge.\n\nReleased during WCW's heyday (and roughly a few months before WCW's eventual downfall), the game showcases an astoundingly deep roster for game that came out in the 90s.  A total of 63 WCW/nWo wrestlers were divided up into different factions:  WCW 1 (main-event wrestlers), WCW 2 (mid-card wrestlers), WCW 3 (opening match wrestlers), WCW 4 (Cruiserweight wrestlers), nWo White, nWo Red, and Raven's Flock.  Further, there were roughly a dozen or so other wrestlers listed under the imaginary EWF and DAW leagues included in the game; these wrestlers were modeled after Japanese wrestling stars but had their likenesses changed to avoid copyright issues.\n\nThe controls of the match are simple enough for anyone to jump in and learn, but you have to understand the psychology of wrestling (and use the controls accordingly) if you want to go deep into the championship modes of the game.  Players use the B button to strike, A button to initiate a grapple, the d-pad to move, and the joystick to either taunt or execute a special move.  The player can differentiate between a weak strike/grapple and a strong strike/grapple by holding the respective button down until the move is executed.  The more \"worn down\" your opponent is, the better chances you have of successfully hitting them with a strong attack.  Yet if you try to initiate a strong grapple on an opponent who's not worn down, they'll likely reverse the attack and counter with one of their own.  So much like real wrestling, you have to wear your opponent down with the weak attacks until you move up and hit them with the strong ones (and also like wrestling, it's a good idea to generate a response from the audience by letting out a taunt while your opponent's down.)  Once your spirit meter is full, you can strike an opponent with a special move by initiating a strong grapple and then moving the joystick (or alternately using the joystick when on the turnbuckle if the finisher's an aerial maneuver.)  The controls also allow you to run, leave the ring, block/counter an attack, dodge an attack, and set your focus on another opponent if you're involved in a handicap or tag team scenario.\n\nThe game has several modes:  Championship, Exhibition, and Special Modes.  The exhibition mode is a singles or tag team match where the player can face either the computer, a friend, or a few friends since the game supports up to 4 players.  The championship modes allow the player to compete for the WCW TV Championship, the WCW Cruiserweight Championship, the WCW Tag Team Championship, the WCW United States Championship, and the grand-daddy of them all, the WCW World Heavyweight Championship (affectionately referred to as the Big Gold Belt.)  While the path to the Television titles and the Cruiserweight titles aren't terribly challenging, you will need to bring your \"A\" game when competing for the higher-tiered titles (or you can dial the difficulty down to Easy, either or.)  The special modes essentially allow the player to engage in specialty handicap or battle royal exhibition matches; with the former allowing for 2-on-1 or 3-on-1 battles while the latter will have 4 competitors fighting each other in the ring until one's eliminated, with the option to allow up to 40 contestants to enter the match.  You're also given a mode where you can customize the given wrestlers to either have different names or to have them wear different costumes.\n\nThe upside to the game is that it's still fun to play, even 15 years later.  As I said earlier, anyone can pick up the controllers and jump in, while the subtle nuances of the game don't take much effort to figure out as you go along.  The soundtrack is limited but I don't ever think anyone confused WCW's entrance music with the music that Jim Johnston (of WWE fame) has released over the years (with the only exception being Goldberg's theme.)  The graphics were a work in progress considering where the franchise was at by the time WWF No Mercy was released, but it was still leaps and bounds better than what most expected from the gameplay of other systems at the time (as a reminder, this game was released for a console that is three generations removed from what's available today.)  If there was one drawback from the game, it's the limited gaming options that exist.  Once you beat the championship mode, that was essentially it as far as beating the game was concerned.  There were no steel cage match options, tag teams were limited to 2-on-2 action, and the create-a-wrestler option wouldn't be introduced until THQ/AKI began releasing titles for WWF.  Other gripes I have are that you can't seemingly control whether or not someone interferes on your behalf and the fact that the CPU can \"Hulk up\" their spirit meter rather effortlessly while the player has to do all the little things right to make that possible.\n\nWith all that said, however, the game's fun factor makes it a legitimate \"must have\" for wrestling fans and should be considered by N64 fans who are looking for a beat-em-up button-masher where the top prize is the WCW Championship.  I recommend this to N64 gaming fans, wrestling fans, and people who watched wrestling \"when it was cool.\"", "summary": "A Popular 90's Wrestling Title That's Still Fun To Play Today", "unixReviewTime": 1390867200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2012", "reviewerID": "A2IHA4FW6TJLYN", "asin": "B00000DMB9", "reviewerName": "Robert", "reviewText": "Love this game.

The wrestlers (most of them anyway) have a whole lot of moves, and they are not all the same for every wrestler. The inclusion of the \"real\" wrestlers' signature moves is very cool. One of the things I especially like about the game is the number of wrestlers on it. There are 62 of them --- that's a lot more than a lot of later wrestling games have. A few of them are locked at the start, but they're not really that hard to unlock --- at least not with the difficulty level on \"easy.\" Several wrestlers who were later on the Legends games (Hogan, Macho Man, Sting, Bret Hart, Steiners, and others) are here. Some of the wrestlers are made-up, or at least I assume they are. The graphics are good. The wrestlers are blocky, but the \"real\" wrestlers' faces are very realistic. The play control is very good --- a lot better than the play control on World Tour. Some people may think the gameplay isn't \"deep\" enough, but it suits me just fine. The 40-man Battle Royal is really cool. There are several different arenas, which is kinda neat but (in my opinion) doesn't really do that much for the game. The sound effects and music are (in my opinion) not great but good enough. The wrestlers don't have individual entrance music, but oh well --- no biggie (again, my opinion). There is no commentary, but that's fine with me because I always turn off the commentary on games, anyway. One of my fave game features is the Costume Change mode. This mode lets you take wrestlers and put other wrestlers' outfits on them, and lets you edit the colors of the outfits. That's fun (I think so, anyway)! You can even change the wrestlers' names, but why would you ever really want to do that (unless maybe somebody [like Giant] has changed their name in real life)? There isn't much if anything about this game that I have any major complaints about. Sure, it's dated now, but I still find it as fun as I did back in 1998 (I think that's when it first came out).

Defeating each boss gives Crash a new 'power move' that will be needed in upcoming levels.  There are also five 'bonus' levels in the game.  The levels have Crash and Coco running, swimming, flying planes and spaceships, and riding tigers, jetskis, dinosaurs, and harleys.  For an additional challenge, you can try to get the one or two gems that are found on each level.  This usually requires smashing all of the boxes found on the level.

I can't stop playing until I get all of the crystals, gems, and relics.

The game offers much variety which keeps it very interesting, but is still easy to learn because of the limited number of controls.

The PC version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse.. sure, it may be useless to crash into another train, but it was entertaining. The PS version doesnt have a train.. but yet, it has the tracks for it, so go figure that one out.\n\nNext, lack of vehicles. The PC version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town.\n\nAnd something no one can say wouldnt be better... you can edit the PC version, not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself, but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools. You can not just add cars, you can add missions, put more cars into things, edit the exsisting map, or hell, make your own city from scratch.\n\nWhen I play this game, i like to ride around in Knight Rider, or maybe the General Lee, try and eulude cops driving lambourghinis... gouranga!\n\nConvinced the PC versions better?

As I understand it the weapons, enemies and level textures are the same, but the actual level designs are N64-exclusive, which is a neat touch. Much like the first Quake it's not a thinking man's shooter like Perfect Dark or GoldenEye, but there are some surprising elements such as the enemies that take potshots at you in their death throes.

Bowser is hiding somewhere in the castle and you must find him by collecting all of the hidden stars scattered throughout various paintings that give Mario his power. To find Bowser, you must climb to the top of the tower. Each floor requires a certain number of stars that have to be collected before you can move on. Every painting that has stars in them are magical paintings that Mario can jump through to transport himself to a different world were he can explore for stars.\n\nOverall, I rank the game a 9/10 for its creativity and several different ways it keeps players focused and entertained. The makers of Mario did a fantastic job integrating so many different aspects of gaming, which in turn made it so great. I hope that whoever is reading this can come to their senses and BUY THIS GAME!", "summary": "Super Mario 64 Review", "unixReviewTime": 1357776000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2012", "reviewerID": "A2SKKW2P0JGOC5", "asin": "B00000F1GM", "reviewerName": "Meeps", "reviewText": "The kids play this game at least once a week since they've had it so yes its worth the money", "summary": "Super Mario 64", "unixReviewTime": 1356048000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2012", "reviewerID": "A17L6BFV5F3MIK", "asin": "B00000F1GM", "reviewerName": "KitKat", "reviewText": "This work, no problem at all and appreciated it.

My friend, (who we will call Courty) who was born in 1987 and who I consider as close as a brother, was just a young kid and going through the hell of his family disintegrating.  His father was dysfunctional and drank a lot and his mother was an adulterer.  His mother and my mother grew up together and known each other since grade school.  His brother and my brother were best friends, being the same age.  And although there was a seven year difference between himself and I, we were super close (and still are), because of how close our families were (and still are).  I remember turning 17 in January of 1997, and my family had a big birthday party and I got my very own N64 and a copy of this game.\n\nThose were brutally hard times for all involved with so much pain.  The parents divorced and the dad got his own house.  In the midst of that, the boy's dad bought him an N64, along with \"Super Mario 64\" and \"Star Wars, Shadows of the Empire\".  For me, this game is forever tied up into that emotionally turbelent period in our lives, because both my friend and myself would play this for hours and hours just to escape the hollowness and the pain we both felt at what was going on around us.  That, my friends, is the power of Super Mario.\n\nAnyway, I grew up in the NES and SNES era.  Context is so important, because without the context of growing up in those years, the impact of \"Super Mario 64\" is completely lost to younger people.  To the generation that has \"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\", \"Gears of War\", the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, the \"Mass Effect\" trilogy, \"Assasin's Creed\", \"Metroid Prime\" trilogy,  and the \"Call of Duty\" series, playing through \"Super Mario 64\" now may feel like you're going backwards, and you'd be right.\n\nThe best analogy for those who didn't grow up during that time would be like watching a black and white television from the 1950s or 1960s, and then within a mere ten years, you are now watching a Plasma TV capable of 3D technology.  Or the 1939 movie \"The Wizard of Oz\", when Dorothy opens the door and everything goes from black and white to glorious colour.  \"Super Mario 64\" was THAT much of a gamechanger.\n\nI've been with Super Mario since day one all the way back in 1985.  There is not a single \"Super Mario\" game that I have missed out playing at launch, with only two exceptions, \"Super Mario Land\" for the Gameboy and \"Super Mario Sunshine\" for the Gamecube.  Each Mario game was a revelation and just utterly fun back in that era, even though they were short.  My first exposure to \"Super Mario 64\" was sometime in the fall of 1996.  I just remember being in utter amazement - remember, though there may have been some 3D forays before \"Super Mario 64\", nothing, and I mean NOTHING, looked this amazing or played this awesome.  I would play the game for hours and hours, and felt like I was in a fully interactive novel or world.  I can remember thinking \"Where do game makers go from here?  This is utter perfection!\"  I niavely thought the graphics would never be equaled, they were that good.  I remember telling Courty's brother (my own brother's best friend) back in the late 1980s \"Wow, just imagine if they go past 16 bit and go to like 80 bit or 100 bit!  Just think how amazing that would be!\"  And with the 64 Bit, I felt that what I had been talking about had come to past.\n\nFor those who didn't grow up back then, it can be easily to forget just revolutionary \"Super Mario 64\" truly was.  Just eleven years prior to the 1996 induction of \"Super Mario 64\" to popular consciousness, we were playing such early titles as the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" (the best launch game for the NES hands down), \"Excitebike\", the absolutely dreadful \"Ten  Yard Fight\", etc.  From 1985 to 1994 we saw some of the greatest games ever made in glorius 8-Bit, but especially the early NES titles are so far removed from current gaming that there will be those out there who find them hard to play.  Look at some of the old NES ads on Youtube or game magazines from the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nBut technology moves on, and the SNES and Sega Genesis were fighting for dominance in the early 1990s.  Once we graduated to the SNES and the Genesis, gamers moved beyond mere platforming to more expansive types of games such as the \"Final Fantasy\" titles, \"Act Raiser\", \"Sim City\", \"Super Metroid\", \"Chrono Trigger\", and \"The Legend of Zelda: A Link tot he Past\".  Either that or we were all playing Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II clones.  By 1995 we saw Nintendo push the SNES to its limits technologically with such titles as \"Star Fox\" and the \"Donkey Kong Country\" trilogy, as well as \"Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island\".\n\nThe plot is simple.  Bowser kidnapped Princess PEACH Toadstool (the first time she was ever referred to as \"Peach\" in North America) after the Princess invited you over for some cake.  It is up to you as Mario to go forth and rescue Power Stars that are hidden throughout the castle.  Enough about the plot.  Let's get to the gameplay.\n\nAnd the gameplay, oh the gameplay!  You are in a fully interactive 3D environment.  After turning the N64 on and getting a file set up (after spending entirely too much time messing with Mario's face at the starting screen - don't worry, we all did that!), Mario jumps out of a pipe, and you are in a field with a castle ahead of you.  You can jump, swim, scoot, crawl, kick, punch, wall-jump.  Yo  can do a backflip even and a triple jump and a long jump.  The game is so vibrant, colorful, and, at least back in the late 1990s, simply a beauty to behold.\n\nYou go to the castle, and after you are introduced to your friendly camera man (who everyone now very fashionably hates on), the Lakitu (in a rare state of not throwing Spinies at you), you are free to go where ever you wish, provided you have enough stars.  The castle is the overall hub, and by jumping into different portraits on walls, pools, down tunnels, and even looking into the sunlight in the castle will open you to one of the game's fifteen overall levels or a secret level.  Nintendo wisely made certain parts of the castle inaccessible until you have gained enough power stars, but these goals are quite easy to meet.\n\nThere is simply so much to do and so much to see, whether you are fighting King Bob-Omb and the Bob-Omb Battle Field, raising with Koopa the Quick, and navigating the snowy terrains of \"Cool, Cool Mountain\" and \"Snow Man's Land\".\n\nThe levels are just so memorable.  Mario controls the water levels present in \"Wet Dry World\".  \"Dire Dire Docks\" has an enormous sub and a cool stingray.  \"Tall, Tall Mountain\" pits you against a theiving monkey.  \"Shifting Sand Land\" features a great battle against a pair of hands called Eye Rok, a cranky vulture who will steal your cap, and a great pyramid.  \"Letha Lava Land\", a level literally likened to hell, has a volcano and a sea of lava that Mario must contend with.  The last two levels are particularly fiendish: \"Tick Tock Clock\" is an enormous clock level that speeds up or slows down depending on what time the clock reads when you enter the level, and \"Rainbow Ride\" (always my personal favorite) is probably the most difficult, with an expansive sky level where Mario gets to ride magic carps riding on enormous rainbows.\n\nThen there's \"Whomp's Fortress\" (which was remade into a retro stage for \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\"), always fun, \"Jolly Roger Bay\" (a nautically themed, very creepy level with a scary eel and an enormous pirate ship; it was always my least favorite), a haunted mansion \"Big Boo's Haunt\", and a level of either epic or bite size preportions, \"Tiny-Huge Isaldn\".  Each level brings new and fun ways to interact with the environment hithertoo unseen previously in other levels.\n\nThere are all three secret cap levels that are a lot of sun as well, including flying.  \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" may be the first time Mario flew, but it was \"Super Mario 64\" that Mario really took to flight like never before.  Also the Princess's Secret Slide is a lot of sun fun, and houses the most obscure star of them all (you must beat the slide under 21 seconds, and the most surefire way to do that is actually jump off the slide and land down much farhter)\n\nOne thing that I really love about \"Super Mario 64\", and which the other 3D Marios have not included, is how open ended the title is.  You can really go anywhere and are not limited to individual stars.  As great as the Galaxy games are (and believe me, they're fantastic, especially the second), they don't have the open ended exploration of SM64 and are more linear and streamlined.\n\nThe closest akin to the exploration factor is \"Super Mario Sunshine\" (a game I have tried and simply cannot get into).  However, whereas you are limited to whatever star you choose in \"Super Mario Sunshine\" (and this fact alone makes for some tedious gameplay in that title), in \"Super Mario 64\" has all six stars available (with only one or two exceptions) from the get go, giving you much more freedom to do whatever you want.  Streamlining is important, and when Nintendo removed the abilitiy to get any star you want at the onset of the level, they ended up with the somewhat confusing and tedious levels of \"SMS\".  It's a very fine line between streamlined and open ended, but SM64 has that balance spot on.\n\nGoing back now, yes, even though back then I didn't think it was possible back in 1996 when I first played this, we moved far beyond this game graphically.  The polygons look dated, and the camera has gotten a notorious repution, with IGN even calling the camera system \"broken\" by today's standards.  And yes, subsequent titles may have perfected the 3D gameplay, but really, it was Mario that led the charge, and even today the game holds up well.  Now I play \"Super Mario 64\" with my own kids who love it too.\n\nThis game has meant so much to me and got me and my brother (he may as well be) through some very rough times.  Add And for that I will always be thankful.

Castlevania, Mega Man... they failed and have not been revived. Did Mario succeed? YES! This game is a legend. I heard about it in 2009 (not 1996) in a Nintendo Power magazine simply titled \"Mario\". I did not own a Nintendo 64 (this was 2009). The only system I had was an original Wii that we used for Mario Kart. I was somehow able to persaude my parents to buy me a Wii Point Card with 2000 points on it (enough for Mario 64 and Super Mario Bros 3). I downloaded it and was greeted with a happy Mario face that said \"HELLO!\". Soon I was distorting him to where he had no moustache and had big ears. Then I started the game and got a message from Peach. In her girly princess voice she read the letter, which told Mario she had baked a cake for him. The plumber could not resist and jumped out of a warp pipe onto the castle grounds. I had never played a 3D Mario Game. I stuck to Animal Crossing, Mario Kart, My Sims, and Wii Sports (I was 8 years old). After a little bit of exploring I entered the castle. Instead of a cake Mario got a scary message from Bowser (Who ate cake, I guess). Soon I was hiking up a hill to meet a giant king bomb complete with a moustache and crown. He told me (using fancy king words) that in order to get the bomb I had to defeat him. I defeated him and moved on to the next level, a giant fortress ran by slabs of concrete with faces. Then I started level 3, a snow level. What a level that was! Finding baby penguins, building snowmen, sliding down a slide. Then my parents walked in. My mom said \"YUCK! What are those dots supposed to be?\". Those dots were snow flakes. My dad said \"Are those graphics... 64 bit?\" I had not even realized the graphics were bad because I was lost in the creative levels. Each level had an original design with interesting puzzles and obstacles put in the way of the star. Each boss was different and interesting. The graphics are outdate, so what? This, along with Mario 3, really changed my view of video games. Now (in 2012) I have almost no respect for high-powered consoles like the Xbox 360. Kids should play these old games. How hard is it to get kids a $20 card so that they can enjoy a unique classic like this? The challenge is not too much. If you get stuck on one level you can try another.

Peavey", "reviewText": "Super Mario 64 one of the greatest games for N64.\n\nStory/Plot: the Story begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. However, when he arrives, Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castle's 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to other worlds, in which Bowser's minions keep watch over the stars. Mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more Power Stars, and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses, each leading to its own battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle. After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle, Peach is released from the stained-glass window above the castle's entrance. Peach rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.\n\nGameplay: Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask a favor (such as pink \"peace-loving\" Bob-omb Buddies). The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As more stars are collected, more areas of the castle hub world become accessible. The player unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses. There are many hidden mini-courses and other secrets to the game, most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely. Some courses contain cannons that Mario can access by speaking to a pink Bob-omb Buddy. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the Wing Cap equipped, cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.\n\nThe gameplay and control is fricken awesome u can control mario in more ways then 1.\n\nPower ups: Some courses have special cap power-ups which augment Mario's abilities. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage, allows him to withstand wind, walk underwater, and be unaffected by noxious gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage.\n\nAbilities: Mario can wall jump, long jump, and many more.\n\nMusic: the Music is all original nothing has been copied but the game music is awesome for each stage. In short Super Mario 64 is a great game and it deserves respect.\nThis game is a must get in your video game collection.

I had been hearing about how awesome the Nintendo 64 was going to be from schoolmates as we eagerly anticipated the USA release of this system. I remember hearing how in demand it was and the ensuing shortage for the upcoming Christmas before I even saw it. Then one day I was Christmas shopping with my dad and happened to come across a demo set-up in the mall, and I finally got to see what the massive hype was about.\n\nThe game was bright and colorful, and Mario was fully 3D. A large crowd had gathered around to catch a glimpse of the latest in video game technology, and I only lingered for a moment, yet my first impression is still fresh in my memory. Mario 64 looked like nothing I had ever seen before, and also looked leaps and bounds better than anything I had ever seen on Playstation, Sega Saturn or any other system. I was very impressed.\n\nSeveral months later, I finally saved up enough money to purchase the system bundled with Mario 64. I loved the game dearly back then, and to this day I still love this game. It still looks, feels and plays unlike any other game that came out during that era. While Zelda Ocarina of Time is similar graphics-wise, that game is so great in it's own right that both games deserve to be recognized separately.\n\nMario 64 is a perfect launch game for the Nintendo 64 home console system. Looking at the controller for the N64, one might have been understandably skeptical due to the layout. However, Mario 64 is actually very easy to control and is a good introduction to getting gamer's accustomed to the new feel of the controller and it's new button layout.\n\nWhen I say the controls for this game are very simple, I must also mention that Mario is capable of many actions. Mario can walk, run, crawl, jump, triple jump, backflip, side somersault, wall kick, swim, climb, punch, kick, slide, fly, shoot from a cannon, butt-splash, hang, hand-over-hand, crouch, surf on koopa shells, and even look around. While this scope of actions seems like a lot and likely difficult to master, the reality is that yes, it is alot but is not difficult at all to master. A few of the skills, such as wall kicking or flying take some practice to master, but the majority of Mario's actions are very easy to master, which results in very fluid gameplay and the sensation of actually being Mario.\n\nThe camera angles are manageable considering you have control over them. You might find yourself slightly frustrated with it in certain enclosed areas (such as Boo's Haunted House) but for the most part, the camera angles are very functional. The gameplay is extremely fun with a very gradual learning curve. While you only need 60 stars to complete the game, players looking to one-up the challenge can elect to try and collect all 120 stars, which requires true mastery of the game.\n\nThe music is outstanding. Koji Kondo, also famous for the Ocarina of Time music, did all the music for Mario 64 and succeeded in composing very memorable and enjoyable tunes. My personal favorite is and will always be the Jolly Rodger Bay / Dire Dire Docks music.\n\nThe level design is unique with some truly large levels offering tons of exploration. Mario will find himself in sunken ships, caves with toxic gas, inside a volcano, a pyramid, in a desert, a fortress in the sky, sliding down slippery snowy slopes, and even inside a giant strange clock. This game is filled with fun challenges and hours of terrific gameplay. I don't believe I've ever met anyone that didn't find this game fun to play.\n\nNo, Luigi is not in the game. There was a major hoax citing ridiculous methods that would unlock Luigi, but all proved untrue. Kind of strange Luigi wasn't in the game, but not that big of a deal.\n\nMario 64 is well loved and remembered, but it is kind of strange that the Nintendo 64's launch game is almost incomparable to the entire library of games that followed. Super Mario World on Super Nintendo was a gem, but there were other great games in the SNES library. However, with the Nintendo 64, Super Mario 64 along with Zelda Ocarina of Time stand head and shoulders above pretty much every game in the Nintendo 64 library, which is disappointing considering that we see the Nintendo 64 was capable of supporting top-notch games. The Nintendo 64 library just didn't manage to produce games that lived up to the original launch game.\n\nIn the end, Mario 64 will always be remembered as the revolutionary classic that literally defined the Nintendo 64-bit era.", "summary": "Mario Kicks Off The 64-Bit Era In Style", "unixReviewTime": 1320278400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2011", "reviewerID": "A2R2DUHIXH0AA5", "asin": "B00000F1GM", "reviewerName": "Game Enderz REVIEWS!", "reviewText": "I didn't use to be into Mario or Kirby but now I like them both as much as I like the Legend of Zelda series I still have many more games to purchase based on those 2 characters.

For the first time, Nintendo was being challenged on its own ground and they had to answer Sony with a console of its own. After they put the Super Nintendo system to rest, they went to work and released the Nintendo 64 to the public. The odds were against them because with only two launch titles to choose from, early adopters had to either pick Pilotwings 64 (a good game) or Super Mario 64. This game was the reason Nintendo's console immediately flew off the shelves and showed that Mario can make the jump to 3D and it was fun doing so.\n\nI'll make my review short because other reviewers had covered the basics and importance of Super Mario 64. It stars Mario in an open world where each stage is contained within various paintings scattered through Princess Peach's castle. The storyline is pretty typical by now: King Bowser kidnaps the princess and you jump in to rescue her. The graphics are colorful, bright and were a breakthrough in video game technology at the time. The controls are perfect and take almost no time to get used to. It's a pretty challenging game so expect to replay certain stages over and over again. So why did I give it 4.5 stars? The camera is not perfect but back then, getting the camera to work in any open world style game was difficult to program. It always centers behind you but sometimes gets a little wacky when you go up ledges or around corners. It gets annoying after awhile but you learn to tolerate it.\n\nWhat made this game groundbreaking was that games of this type proved to be a challenge to make and to make it fun as well is really the main goal. Super Mario 64 exceeds this and was a commercial success with gamers and gained much critical acclaim from reviewers of virtually every gaming publication. Those who say didn't like were in the minority and for reasons that were just too petty and silly. While gaming has changed tremendously since 1996, this game shows that the platform genre was at one point the kind of games that everyone wanted to play. And now, you can either track down the cartridge or get this for the Nintendo DS. So if you haven't played this, take a look for yourself as to why many gamers loved to play this game.

I finally decided to purchase it and I was not disappointed. In my opinion Super Mario 64 is the best in the Mario series and one of the best games ever. This game was a breakthrough in 3Dplatformers and it's easy to see why. The 3D is great for its time and the style is incredible.\n\nThe game is addictive as well. I would play for hours and hours and wouldn't want to stop, and Super Mario 64 does not get tiresome after you beat it for the first time.\n\nThe plot is simple, Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and Mario must save her. But the plot's not important in a video game. The game play is what matters.\n\nThe game is fast paced and you always have new areas to unlock. Despite not having any other areas to go to outside of Princess Peach's castle there are tons of areas inside. Getting to new areas is simple. You need a certain amount of stars to unlock doors, and unlock enough doors to unlock boss doors. Overall, there are 120 stars in the entire game and I would recommend a guide because of how challenging it is.\n\nWhen battling Bowser in this game, I was disappointed. He's so easy. When I beat him the first time I was surprised how easy he was. It was more difficult getting to Bowser than it was battling him. But all three incredible boss stages that were before the battles are so much fun it makes up for it.\n\nThere are also hidden items, characters and power ups for Mario to find.\n\nNow there are a few problems like any other game that I think are quite frustrating. Mario's controls sometimes are a little tough. His wall jumps have to be so precise and if you mess up you have to do it again and again, and the camera sometimes can be tough to use in certain areas. But, despite these problems it's still a great game.\n\nThis game is a must own for Mario fans.

The first few passes through the first few stages were fine, and pretty fun, but the rest of the game ends up being one long, annoying, tedious, impossible, and frustrating chore.\n\nTo start off, the control just isn't good enough to pull off HALF the things you need to do in this game. There are instances where you must execute specific jumps to get you from point A to point B, but half the time, the controller is non-responsive. Especially when it comes to levels that put you high up, this usually means falling...over and OVER again!\n\nTo add to this annoyance is the fact that there are no check points. If a level requires you to go to the top of a mountain, and you spend half an hour just getting up there and then you fall, you have to climb the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN! So if you're like me, and find your self wondering off cliffs every other try because of the awful camera work, you will be playing the same stages over and over with no payoff but one big headache!\n\nNow let's talk about the camera. Throughout most of the game, I found my self fighting IT more than I fought Bowser. It's simply impossible to judge distances based on where the camera is facing at any given time. Pressing the C buttons will move it around, but you have to keep perfectly still in order to avoid suddenly gong sideways or backwards. If you are in a stage where there is a time limit or a complicated jump, this can be particularly fatal.\n\nAdding to this frustration is the fact that it is incredibly easy to over or under jump! This wouldn't be as much of a problem if it weren't for all the levels which require you to get to \"the top\" of things. Again, if you fall once, that's it, you start all over again. If the game designers weren't going to give you any continue points in these levels, why-o-why did they make it SO FRIGGIN' EASY FOR YOU TO FALL!!!???\n\nThere are plenty of levels and stages in this game, and lots to do in all of them. But by the time I cleared one stage, I really questioned whether or not I wanted to even GO to the next. Finally, after reaching a mere 52 stars, my answer is no.\n\nSo that's my two cents on this game, I can't beat it, I don't want to beat it.

It's not.  Just because it's significant and influential in helping pave the way for future Mario titles doesn't mean Super Mario 64 is deserving of its classic status, or that it's any fun to actually play.  Super Mario Galaxy came along and pretty much improved every single aspect of Super Mario 64 so you basically no longer have to play this game other than to get a dated taste of mid 90's gaming history.  The only other possible reason someone would play Super Mario 64 is because they desperately seek open world exploration, and this is basically the only Mario platformer that can at least attempt to satisfy gamers with that particular appetite.  Not that I personally believe the game succeeds at the exploring aspect either.\n\nThe biggest problem is that so much of the land you explore consists of emptiness.  Oh sure you'll see trees, ramps, castles, buildings, enemies such as goombas, chain chomps, badly and laughably animated thwomps lifting up and slamming down, pokeys, rolling boulders, and other things that have become a trademark of the Mario series, but the amount of items to find and collect is *extremely* limited to coins (both yellow and red ones) and the occasional power-up that enables Mario to either fly (which admittedly is pretty fun) or obtain the incredibly boring metal cap that makes Mario invincible.  An alternative to the starman perhaps, with lousy side effects (Mario can't jump as high or far while wearing the metal cap).\n\nWhen you're not experiencing the endless disappointment that is running across empty and boring lands and basically doing nothing but wasting time, you're jumping across a series of unspectacular and very ordinary-presented platforms over and *over* again.  This stuff seriously resembles a beginners course for developing platforms.  It's extremely basic game design.  The platforms are generic square-shaped tiles for you to jump across that quite often are all the same exact size.  It gets monotonous almost immediately.  Only unreasonable Nintendo fans would eat this stuff up, seriously.  Anybody else would obviously be able to detect flawed, repetitive gameplay.  The 2D Mario games move at such a swift pace that you don't even have time to stop and notice the platforms (unless you're an extremely slow gamer).  This is mainly because you don't have to stop and situate Mario a certain way for the purpose of making the perfect jump which is what severely ruins Super Mario 64's gameplay.  And don't EVEN say my skills are horrible when it's obvious through countless youtube videos that several gamers have the same exact issue.\n\nWhile I'm by no means someone who cares about the best graphics available, you gotta admit the ones here have dated horrendously with embarrassing blocky shapes pretty much occupying most areas of the game.  The buildings, water and trees in particular are just awful for the eyes.  Nothing appealing whatsoever about any of the graphics- even the bright inviting colors don't lure me in but rather rub me the wrong way and force some of us older gamers to recall the unpleasant days of Mario Paint.\n\nYou have to collect 120 stars in order to complete the game 100% but guess what?  Many of the stars are flat out boring to collect due to being pathetically easy and basically being handed to you within minutes.  What kind of challenge is that?  The one where you have to swim around and open treasure chests in a certain order is baby-ish, and the one where you swim around collecting 8 predictably located red coins inside a basic building near the beginning of the game is offensive.  Or how about simply stomping a post into a ground to release a gate and thus, release the star?  Don't even *think* about mentioning the ones where you walk up to Toad and he simply hands you the star.  Granted, the game seems to always alternate easy star-collecting challenges with longer and more drawn out ones as a way to balance things out but that's the problem- the stars are either too easy or too long.  There is one star mission so awful it makes your inevitable death seem like something to anticipate- the one where you have to jump across a series of moving poles.  You have to jump at *just* the right moment while making sure you're positioned in the right spot.  This takes forever and is dreadfully annoying.\n\nAlso, what's up with all the little baby games?  Grab a baby penguin and slide down a snowy hill?  Chase the bunny so he doesn't hop away?  These are not suitable for anyone who recalls the challenging portions of previous 2D gaming such as Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World (and yes, these bunny grabbing missions are flaws in Super Mario Galaxy too, in case you think I'm intentionally favoring Super Mario Galaxy for no reason).  At least the cannon-shooting parts are cool.  It's fun figuring out where to launch Mario so he can land safely on upper grounds.\n\nI can't help but feel the red star collecting is overrated.  When you collect red stars in Yoshi's Island, you feel like you're given a really elaborate and perfectly executed assignment since you also have to collect flowers and stars to 100% complete a stage.  It's a lot to do not to mention really darn exciting and satisfying once you've acquired all these items, and constantly keeps your attention span in check while searching for them.  Super Mario 64 basically takes that one red coin-collecting element of Yoshi's Island and makes it a main priority here.  You often have to collect 8 red coins per stage (opposed to 20 in Yoshi's Island) to obtain one of the 120 stars.  Ugh.\n\nBut nothing NOTHING is worse than the fact you have to re-enter stages over and over again just to grab all the stars that are located throughout.  To me this is unquestionably lazy game design.  How can it be anything else?  Who in their right mind would actually *want* to keep going back to the same exact stage ad nauseam?  Super Mario World was guilty of this too granted but not NEARLY to this exaggerated extent.  A terrible idea that gives a false impression a game has replay value but it's exactly the opposite- once you go through the same stage a bunch of times and finally accomplish everything there is to offer, you won't want to repeat these same objectives ever again.  So... you probably won't want to play Super Mario 64 ever again.  Even worse- when you often have to search for 100 coins to obtain a star.  This can take up to 20 minutes and bore you the entire time.  Being forced to collect 100 coins is a lazy way of assuring gamers don't leave any stone unturned because you basically have to thoroughly search every nook and cranny of a stage to even *find* 100 of them.\n\nI also dislike how many of the classic enemies aren't included here such as the hammer brothers, buzzy beetles, bloopers, and cheep cheeps.  Even the koopa troopa is nowhere to be seen (well, other than that one race in the beginning).  You can ride a koopa shell like a skateboard but that doesn't count as an enemy appearance.  He's not a true enemy here.  Why is that?  Why not include all the familiar and well-loved enemies that have become a trademark to the Mario series?  They ruin the pirahna plants by the way.  Why is he sleeping?  Granted he comes alive when you get near, but it's a really weird concept.  At least Nintendo got the boos and haunted house right- a surprising and exciting maze-like high point of the game.  It's a lot of fun sorting through each room of the haunted house stages.  *That's* how you design a memorable stage.  Obviously if you weren't busy running around through several vast and average-designed empty fields of grass, there could have EASILY been room for the inclusion of more enemies.  Hey I'm all for open world exploration, but you have to actually fill in those areas with exciting, creative items that are both fun and rewarding to collect for the player, and enemies that present threatening encounters and a rush of excitement.  Simply throwing Mario into a big 3D world because it's his first grand 3D adventure truthfully isn't going to get the job done I'm afraid.  More needs to be done.\n\nConstantly having to rearrange the camera so you can see where you're actually going is a nuisance.  Nobody likes dealing with a camera while jumping around trying to play a video game, but granted, several games back in the mid to late 90's were guilty of the same camera problems since developers were still getting their feet wet so to speak, and figuring out the best way to help players accurately and conveniently see what's ahead.  Still, you'll lose more than a few lives due to bad camera angles in Super Mario 64.  I guarantee it.  One thing I *do* like about this game is how fast Mario runs.  It's a fast-moving game, which helps going from point A to point B more convenient. Also some of the wall jumps and triple jumps are fun to execute.  Reminds me of Super Metroid in that respect.  Yoshi is teased in this game (I won't spoil how) but he's not actually playable which doesn't make sense.  Why make an appearance if he's not going to be playable?\n\nThe music is either extremely good (the brilliant peaceful moodiness of the water theme and the intimidating and exciting heavy metal-like Bowser fights) or downright horrendous (everything else, which consists of annoying nursery rhyme children's themes inappropriate and painfully skull-smashing for the rest of us).  I can't STAND the theme songs that play in Whomp's Fortress and Rainbow Ride- two unforgivable themes that make me want to smash my brains in whenever I play Super Mario Galaxy 2 where they return in all their overbearingly annoying glory.  Rainbow Ride in particular reminds me of a county hayride where kids ride around on tractors (not to mention the stage itself is extremely tedious and overlong).  The snowy mountain stage with the Italian accordion music is sickening and out of place.  Just mute the volume on your TV to make life easier for yourself.  The boss fights are incredibly simplistic- grab Bowser's tail, spin him around and toss him, or pick up/stomp other bosses.  Basic, boring stuff.\n\nA few stages that are actually fun include Lethal Lava Land where the platforms convincingly feel like an upgrade into the 3D world from the original Super Mario Bros. castle levels (not to mention better/more interesting use of platform jumping compared to the rest of the levels in SM64), Shifting Sand Land since it's packed with obstacles and enemies (and reasonably challenging overall), and Tall Tall Mountain's tricky climb to the top (involving a vine climbing portion).  In fact, to be fair, Tall Tall Mountain is one of the best levels ever in a 3D Mario game.  It's *that* good.  Bowser's castle levels are pretty solid as well, mostly due to the fast-paced nature of them.\n\nSeveral things feel tacky- the 1-ups and coins are small, dark, ugly looking, and clumsily made due to less than spectacular graphics and game design, and overall Super Mario 64 is just a really lackluster and highly overrated game.  If not for influence, this game would have been forgotten and the superior Super Mario Galaxy series would have prevailed even more dominantly than they already do.  Oh and don't even mention the cake-eating storyline.  It's atrocious.  The fact they brought it back for the Galaxy series makes me want to vomit.", "summary": "Mario's first jump into the land of 3D platforming stinks", "unixReviewTime": 1151280000}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "5", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2006", "reviewerID": "A3S34VW0BBC9L6", "asin": "B00000F1GM", "reviewerName": "CharlieGone", "reviewText": "What can I say?

The game was a launch title for the Nintendo 64 and boy did the game make its mark on the console.  Sure we have games like Banjoe Kazooi, Ocarina of Time but this game was the first to come out and is still an instant class and started many many famous game rippoffs(Like many people say Banjoe Kazooi was a ripoff but I DIDN'T SAY THAT so don't flame me!)but that's beyond the point, this game is still one of the most beloved video game ever.  When Super Mario 64 launched with the N64 it was indeed a very revolutionary game, it was the first game to present 3d platforming, state of the art graphics and some of funnest/best gameplay you'll see in platforming/action games.  The game is HUGE!  In Mario 64 you WILL be going through many, many stages to collect stars so you can unlock more areas for more stars and ultimatley put the evil bowser to an end and once again save Princes Peach.  I was one of many people who first played this game back when it launched with the Nintendo 64 and when you compare it to todays games the game(to many, but not me)looks terrible but you gotta understand, the time this game was released(96')it was INFACT the best looking video game ever.....period...and even today when I play this classic, it still looks amazing!  Call me crazy but I seriously still think this is one of the best looking video games of not only the mid 90's but even today, it is still marvalous!  The music in Mario 64 was just plain perfect, the music blended in with the games levels and star hunting, words cannot explain how well Miyamoto and Nintendo did for the music,it's just plain good!  The controls are also tight and well focused, I especially love the array of moves Mario has and although the controls may feel abit clumsy at times it never bothered me once!  As for camera, yes there were times were I wanted to break the tv but the reward and satisfaction of getting a star after that trouble feels so good!  Audio, controls, graphics are all A+ and as for gameplay?...Well it depends..Do you like platforming/action/exploring/collecting games because you will be collecting pretty much for the whole game(Stars, duuhhh)and if the answer is yes then this may be the best game you've ever played!  Now for me the gameplay was truly fun and innovative, I never got bored once in this game.  It's so fun, hunting for stars never gets annoying or frustraiting!  Speaking of difficulty the game is perfect, it's not hard nor is it easy like pie(acctually I take that back, for many people this game will be easy if you wanna just beat the plot)but it just gets it right on difficulty, I don't remember ever being frusraited or angry with the game(then again I never did try to get all 120 stars)and just having a great time with the game...it seriously is one of the funnest experiences I've ever had with a game and as I said before....this game is revolutionary!  Now that I'm done ranting and talking about this game I'll just get to it quickly...\n\nThe Good\n-One of the best and most revolutionary game ever..period\n-Back then and even today it is still one of the best looking video games ever made\n-Loads of things to do\n-Not hard, but not too easy, it's juuuust about right\n-The game is just plain fun, the moves, the platforming, collecting, ect\n-Collecting stars is really fun!\n-The music in this game is just plain fun to listen to!!\n-Though the bosses are easy I still think they're just classics!\n-Will take a very long time to get all 120 stars, and collecting 120 stars means spending lots of time with this amazing title\n-The worlds and places you visit are all so different and an amazment to look at\n\nThe Bad\n-Some may feel that game is feeling abit dated now(the game is pretty old now!!)\n-Some will find the graphics to be \"terrible\" or just \"bad\" which I find hard to believe\n-People who just want to beat the games plot and nothing els shouldn't even touch the game(because the game doesn't take too long to beat for plot and if you're planning on not having a fun time with the game and just wanting to beat the game and getting it over with, what's the point of that?)\n-Some will be angry with the camera\n-Alot of people today or in the future may get this game and probably nag about how easy the bosses are well cry me a river, if you want a hardboss go play something els....other then that get ready to play one of the best games ever...\n\nOverall Super Mario 64 stands up on its own.  The game was indeed revolutionary and braught us amazing visuals, superb gameplay and great controlls aswell as a fun adventure/like plot with lots of collecting to do.  The games music was just great to listen to, the places the game takes you are just so fun and innovative and the moves/mechanics that are enabled for Mario(though limited)are great!

Having said that, it must be stated that SM64 is the greatest videogame to date, and one which all games, regardless of genre, will be judged henceforth. Nintendo set itself a nearly impossible goal and achieved it with SM64. Look closely, Mario's lineage is 2D -- not ideal material upon which to base the most intensely scrutinized 3D videogame ever. But videogames are, in the end, meant to entertain. And entertainment is at the heart of this fantastic title.\nLike many previous Mario games, experimentation is integral to the experience of playing. You must explore everything, leave no rock unturned, no mushroom mute, no door unopened. Mario himself has so many possible movements, and the environment is so intensely interactive, that even the least experimental players will spend hours on the first level without achieving anything in particular. The game is initially less accessible than previous Mario titles, although the three-pronged analog controller isn't really where the difficulty lies -- the joypad itself performs excellently. Overall, the biggest obstacle in the game is finding the correct viewpoint. The camera, which moves on its own (unless directed manually by using the four gold buttons), tries to find the optimal angle to view the action, though occasionally you're simply not able to see where you're going. Additionally, frustration sets in as you spin the camera around while simultaneously attempting to run across a moving plank or tip-toeing across a tiny ledge. But getting the hang of SM64 is all a matter of practice , and as soon you catch on, you will execute these skills unconsciously. The variety of levels and scale each world is simply breathtaking. The game consists of 15 massive courses in which Mario can attain seven stars per course, with numerous secret areas and bonuses, including 15 extra stars (for a total or 120 stars). It'll surely take the average gamer 60 hours to reach the third and final Bowser and free the princess (not to mention find Yoshi), so the game's replay value is bountiful. And despite all of their saccharin-sweet cuteness, the graphics are magnificent. Shigeru Miyamoto's dream of producing an interactive cartoon has been fully realized -- the animation is lavish, the textures rich, and even the most superfluous touches have been completely executed. SM64 is not perfect, however. Despite the efficiency of the hardware's Load Management, draw-in is noticeable, and occasionally gamers will look right through walls or objects. Still, this is as close to perfection a game has ever been (64-bit, no less). Super Mario 64 also puts Nintendo's preference of \"silicon over CDs\" to the test, with pleasingly familiar results. Most owners of either a Saturn or a PlayStation (or both), have by now acclimated to long load times, though grumblingly. Super Mario 64 will remind them of how gaming used to be: load time is nil, and reaching a playable level is only a matter of seconds. From the time you switch on the unit until you're done, the flow is seamless, and moving from one game area to another is instantaneous. Nintendo's musical prodigy, Koji Kondo, turns in an inspired performance, somehow finding room on the small cartridge to create the appropriate music for each world. Even though some tracks are cheesy, others, like the sitar-laden score of the first fire level, are more than effective in setting the mood for the level, and are as atmospheric as any Redbook audio. Also impressive are the sound effects: Mario's onscreen antics are matched by grunts, whoops, and hollers, fleshing out his spunky personality. As a whole, the flagship N64 game more than makes up for any painful delay (or delays) imposed upon the unit's release. SM64 is complete in every way, and the challenging experience of working toward each new level is far greater than the game's minimal flaws. Nintendo's craftsmanship and zeal for creating fantastically enjoyable games has never shown through more than in Super Mario 64. Nintendo 64's early flagship title demonstrates the power of the hardware as well as the creative genius of Miyamoto and team. Not only does the game obliterate every platformer before it in terms of visual finesse, it plays just as well if not infinitely better than previous 2D incarnations of the Mario franchise. 3D worlds are huge and cleverly laid-out so that there's never a dull moment. Secrets play a huge part of the experience, recapturing the classic gameplay style of the series. In fact, this game is exactly as one might hope it would be: Mario in 3D. More freedom, more space, more options, better graphics, improved and elaborated control schemes -- it's all there. Possibly the greatest videogame achievement ever. Don't rent.

The first game that the system ran on was also a scream. It just sometimes comes to me as a surprise that a lot of these newer games that run on CD-ROM like the Playstation 2, and the XBOX may have faster and better graphics, but not likely with the actual loading time.\nNintendo's Super Mario 64, remains as the most dynamic staple of any N64 system to date. The graphics are just completely amazing, and so strong from one angle to another. In Super MArio 64, you guide Mario through 15 terrific stages with exciting adventure around every corner. The object of the game is to try collect as many stars as possible that are hidden in the game. Each star is very vital inorder to help you save Peach, whom is still known as Princess Toadstool, from the vile Bowser. Each course takes you from all depths of the secret kingdom, from Sea, to the firey sky, and even in a spooky ghost-filled house. The load up time for this, and every other N64 game is much faster than the CD-Rom games for the PC, and the other CD-Rom console games.\nIt is kind of sad Nintendo stopped making fantastic games on cartridge like this, and traded it for a CD-ROM gaming factory, with the Gamecube. Nevertheless, Super Mario 64 is still the most superior game of the 20th century, and that is not even a pizza-faced lie.", "summary": "Mario's Landmark", "unixReviewTime": 1034467200}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "3", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2002", "reviewerID": "AUDSM2CTLLW1Q", "asin": "B00000F1GM", "reviewerName": "Irish", "reviewText": "\"Super Mario\" is arguably the most successful and most recognizable brand name in the history.  It seems that every time Nintendo releases a new episode in the series, it hits video gaming gold.  From the earliest release of the original \"Super Mario Brothers\" on the original Nintendo Entertainment System, it has always been a hit.  Even lesser known titles in the series, like \"Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island\", stay faithful to the series and produce very entertaining gameplay.  With the dawn of Nintendo's three dimensional, 360 degree rotating platform, Nintendo 64, the question became, \"Could Nintendo maximize the potential of this new platform and give Mario a fresh angle?\"  The answer, in the form of \"Super Mario 64\", proved to be a quite emphatic \"YES!\"\n\n\"Super Mario 64\" takes the technique of 'multiple goals' for each level (introduced in \"Super Mario World\") and expands it in a quite impressive manner.  There are 15 worlds Mario must navigate in an effort to free the Princess who is trapped in paintings in her castle.  The goal is to accumulate at least 70 stars to unlock the passage way the final battle with Bowser.  As each world contains 7 stars of its own in addition to 15 bonus stars around the castle, it would seem to be a walk in the park.  However, all is not as it seems.  Several of the doors leading the different worlds are sealed off either by locks or star requirements.  Therefore, there is a limited amount of ways to accumulate the necessary stars until more stars are attained or earlier battles with Bowser are won.  Of course, this leads to a journey through amazing worlds were Mario travels the depths of the ocean, soars in the open sky, battles over scorching lava, and even gets to sneak through a haunted house.  The variety of worlds and objectives are truly amazing, as are the new moves Mario can make to help accomplish these goals.  No longer content to just move forward and jump, Mario can now do backflips, long jumps, wall leaps, and crawls.\n\nOne other aspect of \"Super Mario 64\" that makes it standout is its use of rotating camera angles to track Mario's movements through each world.  It takes some getting used to, but it enables a truly three dimensional feel.  This is game that Nintendo built its release of Nintendo 64 around.

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System dies out in the United States. Diablo comes out for the PC. However, the biggest news is the launch of Nintendo's amazing new system: the Nintendo 64, which was lauded for its beautiful graphics and a brilliant new controller.\nTwo games were released along with the system. There was Pilotwings 64, which was not exactly what was expected, but the other game was called the greatest game of all time (as of 1996, that is, at least in the eyes of critics) by several source. And it really was.\nThe first thing that strikes your eyes is its delicious eye candy. The first thing that pops out at you after the title is Giles Goddard's Mario face. And boy does it look good! But enough with the intro. It's time to see whether the game itself passes the graphics test.\nAnswer? Yes it does. Even after five years, Super Mario 64 is still one of the most beautiful games for Nintendo's crowning glory (speaking from a fanboy's POV.) The character and tree designs are very outdated by today's standards, but the water is still lovely (though surpassed) and some of the brick and stone backgrounds still are the most realistic that I have ever seen. Today the graphics would get a C by reviewers, but back in 1996, this game would get an A+.\nBut who cares how it looks. Let's see how it sounds.\nThe answer? Great! Before 1996, Nintendo fans never had a chance to hear Mario talk, but the first thing that greets you when you turn on the system is a jingle and the words \"It's-a me, Mario!\" and \"Hello!\" while a remixed version of the classic Mario theme plays in the back. But again, this is only the intro. The question is whether games sounds that good.\nThe answer, naturally, would be even better. Mario comes packed with a large batch of sayings including \"Mama mia!\", \"Here we go!\" and \"Press start to play!\" Unfortunately, everything else (other than Peach and Bowser) don't talk in anything else other than words. But remember the fact that this is a first generation cartridge game, and if people complain for Zelda, then they shouldn't complain here.\nThe music and sound effects are just divine. Outside the castle, you are greeted with the happy chirping of birds and the roaring of a nearby waterfall. Enter and the cozy castle theme starts playing. Each of the levels come equipped with music that ranges from peaceful to energetic to somber. The Bowser fight music ranges from rock to organ music, and it's all wonderful.\nNow that the graphics and the sound are out of the way, let's get into the meat of the game: the gameplay.\nThe first thing most people would notice is how different this is from traditional Mario games. There are only 1-Up mushrooms, and the only pipe that appears is in the very beginning. However, Super Mario 64 is 3D, and most of those elements just wouldn't work in a 3D game.\nThe story, according to the manual, is that Peach invites Mario over to the castle for a cake. When Mario reaches the castle, he is greeted with a gruff voice. Wondering what went on, Mario explores the rooms and finds a giant painting where he can jump in. There, he finds himself in a new world, with a giant Bob-Omb on the top. He fights and defeats it (you'll have to do that part yourself) and gets a star. Later, he learns that Bowser has attacked the castle, captured the Princess, stolen the Power Stars, and has sent his army to take over the worlds inside the paintings, then the world itself.\nYeah, so it isn't much different from other Mario games, but that's not the point. The point is, there are 120 stars out there (although 70 is need to beat the game, but where's the fun in that?) for you to collect. Your misson to explore 15 worlds to find those 120 stars.\nWell, instead of having a Super Mario and a Mario like in past Mario games, Mario has 8 life bars. Hitting certain enemies would make him lose 2 life bars, as well falling from semi-high heights. Burning Mario's butt will make him lose 3. Certain other enemies and falling from really high heights will make him lose 4. But don't worry. Coins and water will replenish your health. If you lose all 8 or fall down a pit, you lose a life. But for every 50 coins you get with a star and every 1-Up Mushrooms, you get a life.\nYour moves include the standard running, punching, butt-stomping, as well as the kick, the long-jump, the wall-kick, the side-somersault, and the backflip. You can also swim! There are three special caps that gives you special abilities. The Flying Cap gives you the ability to fly. The Metal Cap gives you the ability to walk underwater and be immune to enemy. The Vanish Cap gives you the ability to walk through enemies and certain walls. Mario most employ all of those ablities to save the Princess and the world.\nThe Nintendo 64 controller, with its analog stick, makes it possible for Mario to perform the tasks successfully. (Just imagine travelling in a 3D world with a D-pad.) Some people complain about the camera angles and how you have to control them with the C-button. It may be annoying at first, but eventually you'll get used to it, and it'll come naturally, and you'll learn to play with the bad angles.\nSuper Mario 64 not only has good graphics, good sound, and good gameplay, but the fact that it is revolutionary (in that it brings gaming into the 3D world) makes it not only the best game of 1996, but possibly also the best game ever.

The graphics and sound make excellent use of the N64's capabilities to create a 3D world that was just jaw-dropping in 1996 and is still pretty awesome today.\nAs others have said, the basic story of the game is classic Mario:  Bowser has kidnapped the Princess, and Mario must rescue her.  To do this, he must collect a minimum of 70 stars from the 15 worlds in the game.  These worlds are accessed by jumping through paintings and other objects scattered throughout the Mushroom Castle, plus there are 15 stars contained within the castle itself.  Although you only need 70 stars to finish the game, there are a total of 120 stars available for collection, and you won't be satisfied until you have collected each one.  The 15 worlds have varying levels of difficulty, but each and every world has some easy stars and some that are very difficult.  It took me about 100 hours total to collect all 120 stars and rescue the Princess the first time.  Each level has a different theme.  Some are on mountains, some are in water-filled caves, and there is one set inside a giant clock.  My personal favorite is the haunted house level.\nThe gameplay in Mario 64 is exceptional.  Mario has many different types of moves, ranging from tiptoeing around sleeping enemies, to a great long jump, to a very difficult-to-master wall jump.  You must master all the moves if you expect to get all 120 stars.  Also, there are three special hats scattered throughout the game that allow Mario to fly, walk underwater, and become invisible.  Again, all are vital for 120 stars.\nAfter you finally win, you might expect that you will never want to take on such a huge task again.  But, such is not the case.  Even though you have all 120 stars, you can go back to levels you have beaten and play them over and over, as much as you want.  You'll be tempted to do just that.  The experience of playing through the incredible world of the Mushroom Castle is such that you will be coming back for many repeat visits.", "summary": "Mario continues to lead the pack....", "unixReviewTime": 1004486400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2001", "reviewerID": "AGVIVFVA9AVPE", "asin": "B00000F1GM", "reviewerName": "Oklonia", "reviewText": "Greetings, I am Oklonia.

SUPER MARIO 64 is a gaming revolution,  it was the game that everyone had to have.  It took Mario into a whole new atmosphere.  The world that is inside Princess Peach's(aka Princess Toadstool) castle is immense and highly imaginative.  Although the graphics may seem a little bit dated(it was a launch game remember that) it is still a sight to see.  As far as play control goes, it is a bit difficult to get the hang of moving Mario around, but once you get used to it then controlling Mario is a breeze.  In fact it is some of the best playcontrol that a game has to offer.  The Super Mario 64 storyline is familiar to Mario fans but at the same time a touch refreshing.  Yes Peach is captured but she is being held prisnor in her own castle(in a picture in fact), and one of the funnest parts of the game is hanging out outside.  One of my problems is that Luigi is not in the game, in fact no mention of him is made either.  Nintendo should have left the Mario Party franchise alone and focused on creating a Super Mario 64 2, but alas they didn't.

This review probably would not hold true for hardcore/professional video gamers.  I have played all of the classic Mario Bros games, and loved them all, except for this one. For one reason, and one one reason only. For the casual gamer, controlling Mario in a precise manner is an exercise in futility. If you only play your games a couple of hours a week like me, if you are not a \"pro,\" the human language cannot describe just how much this game will frustrate you. I mean it, the control is HORRIBLE.  For those of you over the age of 21, try to imagine this: You're very very drunk, and trying to walk down an ice covered slope. That would be EASIER than controlling Mario in this game, in places where it matters the most, precise maneuvering in tight spots. You can't use the control pad at all, just the joystick.  With all of the brilliant minds working for Nintendo, I would think that they could have developed a better way to control the character through the use of the control pad.  Another thing. If you are prone to car-sickness or other types of motion induced illness, you can't play this game for more than 30 minutes at a time. Believe me, I'm not stretching the truth. I served 10 years in the USAF, and did alot of flying during those years, so I'm not exactly the \"weak stomach\" type.  Would I recommend buying this game? By all means, yes, if you are a hardcore player. The graphics are pretty cool and have a definite charm. For all you pros out there, I would agree with a 4 or 5 star rating for this game.

The first few weeks i played it, i was amazed at the beautiful 3D graphics. Honestly,  i had never seen 3D graphics before this game, so it was awesome and  inspiring.\nI love this game, so i'm writing this review. There are some  memorable moments from this game (like when Mario ventures into the haunted  mansion or when he goes on a rainbow ride in the skies)\nAll in all, it  showcases the N64 incredible 3D graphics and the sound isn't half  bad.\nThe levels are interesting and sparse ( i beat this game with the  Nintendo Power guidebook) and should take some time to crack the puzzles.  Basically, the game is quite easy and not surprisingly, it has enough  mini-quests and puzzles to keep you occupied. As for level designs, i think  it's excusable considering it's first generation stuff but still deep  enough to immerse you (again) after a long absence...\nMy gripe is while  this game is really good (i mean i'm a big-time Mario fan from the first  mario game), it's only as good as it lasts. I found it hard to go back to  this game after a while- cause it was like having discovered everything and  it made it hard to play through the whole thing again.\nMy advice: play  selectively. You need to get into the mood. While i say that, it's without  doubt that i have never regretted buying this game.\nEven if i never play  this game again and leave it to collect dust (not likely)-i'll always  remember this game as one of the finest moments of the N64 lifetime (that  is 1996-2001).\nAnyway, every Super Mario game is groundbreaking (SMB1  created the side-scroller, SMB2 was queer and fun, SMB3 is the greatest  platform game ever, SMB4 was one of the most replayed game i ever played  and this game is mario in 3D without luigi,which is sad)\nBut cheer up  people- the next generation is almost upon us.

It has playability value but not much, from 1 to 10 maybe a 3, becuase once you master it( spoiler, it takes about a hundred years to get a size million in a city) you just don't give a damn about playing it again.\n\n2.

It's easy to learn to play, and inexpensive, and the graphics are pretty good for those who care unless you get to close( highest zoom).\n\n4. You can voyage out of reality and build a city of imagination.\n\nNow these are the concerns about the game.\n\n1. The game has very little realistic qualities about it, it is not in check with the real word, even the information bar suggest it was mad for kids.\n\n2. There is no names for streets, no district and area setting, and no combining indidvidual parks to make one small, medium or large park( Different small or large parks placed to getting but functioning different ans seperate is not realistic).\n\n3. There are not as many tax forms as they are in the real world, and the maps are either way too small or only show the central part of the city, which is also unrealistc, since all large cities have metros.\n\n4. The max loan size is way too small, and the interest is a bit extreme.\n\n5. The airports don't generate as much income as they should.\n\n6. There are not nearly enough mass transit options in the game, and the availabe ones are very unrealistic. The train option is just horrific, and the subway us expensive and not very fun to build,( they were probably thinking that the game is about cit building, but transportation is a huge part of any city over 300,000) the highways are basicly useless and very expensive and difficult to build, and there are no underground building and other types of roads and highways, and no street lights and signs.\n\n7. It is just about impossible to get a city size of over 4 million even on the larget plot availabe, and even when thinking this is just the central part of a city and the metro is not shown on map is still not feasible, since the large us cities have far more than 5million people in there central part.\n\n8.

Breazeal", "reviewText": "First off, let me clear up some misstatements about the features listed above by amazon.com:\n*Realistic 3-D environment\nWrong. The game is 2D, it merely looks 3D. It IS realistic, however. There is far more detail in  2D than could ever have been done in 3D and still hae it run on everyone's  machine.\n*View cities from up to 50,000 feet\nI guess...you have 5 zoom  levels. The above implies that you can zoom to any level.\n*Detailed  control over businesses and other facilities\nNone whatsoever other than  being able to zone blocks of residential, commercial, and industrial areas,  along with other specialized zones. You can't micromanage any individual  businesses.\n*Everything and everyone moves\nCars and SimCitizens move,  so do some animated buildings, but certainly not EVERYTHING.\n*Optional  load-in sets for customization and enhancements\nThat's handled much  better in SC3K Unlimited.\nSimCity 3000 is a mixed bag for me. I love  being able to play a fully updated version of 2000, but whether it should  be called 3000 or 2100 is something of a dilemma.\nGraphics-wise, 3000 is  beautiful! No two ways about it. A lot of hype has gone into the fact that  you can now zoom in and see little sims walking, driving around in  individual cars, and so on. The building images are now fully 4-sided  entities so that rotating the view yields 4 different looks at each  feature. Five zoom levels let you choose the size you're comfortable with  to build on. Some people claim that the buildings are blocky and pixellated  at the highest zoom. I don't have that problem, but they are definitely not  the crisp renders that the other 4 zooms are. They are merely enlargements  of the 4th zoom. Vehicles and pedestrians remain crisp and distinct at any  zoom.\nGameplay: here's the sticking point for me. If you've continued to  play SimCity 2000 until you're red-eyed and guaranteed to be late for  work/school, you'll probably do the same with 3000. Given all the new bells  and whistles, it'll take some time to try them all and see how this affects  that. From this point, however, two camps emerge. One camp will continue  playing the game for years and loving every minute of it, relishing the  freedom to create anything they want. I fall into this category. The other  camp, once having seen everything and mastered building megalopoli at will,  are going to wonder what's the fun anymore. So depending on your  expectations for the game it'll be either a gift from heaven or something  you may well have wished didn't cost 40 to 50 bucks.\nAs for difficulty,  it's no harder really than 2000. Some of the new features like garbage  disposal, ordinances, and neighboring city dealings add depth and strategy  without making the game unduly complex. Maxis should be commended for  that.\nOverall? It's good. In fact it's very good. They put a lot of work  into it making sure everything balances more or less. Is it worth the  money? Not now with SC3K Unlimited out. Get it instead, as it's much more  refined. If you haven't played a SimCity game before or if you're a diehard  2000 fan, absolutely. If you just sorta liked 2000 and quit playing it  after a little bit, you may want to wait until it hits the bargain rack.", "summary": "It's better than SimCity 2000, but....", "unixReviewTime": 958521600}, {"overall": 1.0, "vote": "3", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2000", "reviewerID": "A3KMOEVKYDKEY7", "asin": "B00000G16I", "reviewerName": "G.

Read on to see why it's a below average game:\nTHE GOOD\nFinally, Castlevania in 3-D!  Despite many shortcomings, the game does have some eerie music and a dark atmosphere, which are characteristic of a Castlevania game (at least the newer releases).  You can select between two characters (Carrie and Reinhart) that change the storyline somewhat.\nTHE BAD\nI was never a fan of the 64 controller and this is the one game where it hurt most.  The controls and gameplay were difficult at best, and normally I have a decent tolerance level for controls; Here's where I absolutely loathed it.

I have played every Castlevania game right back to the NES days, and this is a good addition to a fine series. This is a great game, but not as good as \"Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\" for Playstation.\nTo start on a positive note, there is a lot of depth added thanks to the 3-D graphics. You can roam freely, battle monsters face-to-face, and search for hidden items without the constraints of side-scrolling. The control is responsive, and the buttons are easy to figure out, which is good considering the pace of the game. The 3-D worlds are huge, and are fun to explore. The sound is also excellent. You can hear the clatter of bones, the snapping of jaws, and the cracking of whips clearly, without that horrible distortion that we all remeber from earlier installments.\nThe cons of this game are mostly technical, nothing to do with the graphics or storyline. First of all, the camera can be a servere pain sometimes. It often lingers when you don't want it to, and the response time for panning and scanning is pertty bad.\nThe control is good, but sometimes it is clunky when you need to perform delicate movements.

Flickering lights,stumbling into a room that's completely and full of monsters,or hitting a switch that unleashes a ton of monsters...defend yourself or die! The dark mood that Doom provides is very thick for early 90's fare.\n\n*Some people think for an old game like this there's lifeless brown or grey colored levels on flat land without even playing it...not true. Pentagrams everywhere,corpses impaled,walls made from flesh,scrolling walls made from intestines. I think it's the eighth level on Doom I you meet the barons of hell in the center a star-shaped room that's like a temple most unexpectedly...caught me completely off guard first time I ever played Doom and never forgot it. That's one thing about the older Doom games,chockful of surprising moments!\n\n*The enemies of Doom I were good but Doom II they just added more to the roster that were literally far tougher and could kill you quick if you weren't on your toes. Mass quantities of monsters coming at you at once as the Doom series I always found to possess the most intense battles you'll come across on a FPS game.

The framerate is pretty smooth to me and the graphics are spot on to me. A bad version of Doom was for the Sega 32X that was a very stripped down and clearly stuck out like a sore thumb to the PC version.

I thought this game was awesome. Especially the beginning, Forest Of Silence! The music and sound effects are great and the game story is good. The controls may take a while to get used to but if you like games with a challenge, get this. I think that fighting skeletons gets boring after a while but I think when you get to higher levels, (I'm not sure of this) there will be more vicious enemies to fight for your pleasure. I thought the game could have been a little more...well....diverse and detailed, but where I am now, is awesome! I have to say, I bought this at Fucoland and I had no idea I would like it this much. I rented it once before and I hated it because it was so hard. Really, I just didn't put my mind to it and look where I am now. I'm in the 1st castle! This is a great action-RPG game that will keep you hooked for hours. I would recommend that 10 and up should play this game because of the theme and the bloody scenes. There isn't much of a story to this game but for me, that's okay. But for serious gamers (I think I am but this game is so good that I don't really care about the story) you might be a little ticked off because of the lack of story. There many levels for you to get through and they all take a long time. The Forest Of Silence took me about 3 hours to figure everything out (no cheats no guide no nothing). There are two charaters to chose from. Reinhart and a girl (I forgot her name). Now Reinhart has a sword and a whip to fight off enemies and to destroy other things. I think he is better than the girl because he has a stronger weapon. The girl has a energy ball that takes 2 seconds to charge up. I don't like that because if an enemy is comming towards you, you have to charge. She also has these two....rings they look like. She uses that to slice things, just like Reinhart's sword. There are two modes you can go through. Easy and Normal. Normal is not that hard but there is quite a difference between that and easy. There are some options that you can do like the controls and stuff. As I mentioned before, their isn't much of a storyline but when you start the game, there is some. So that makes the game better.

While you were all watching Barney the dinosour, my dad and I were blasting demons with rocket launchers and taking out whole armies with a shotgun. I think Doom 3 is really just a remake of Doom 1, but if I had to choose between the two, I'd likely choose this one. Doom 3 is awesome and VERY addictive, but it's so realistic it tends to often freeze up a lot, and don't even get me started on Quake 4... But anyway, Doom was probably the first FPS game I ever played, although with my age, I wasn't really good at it at first. But if I were to play it now, I'd probably be halfway through the game in one day. I never even played Doom II, though my dad did show me the first level of it a long time ago.

The Playstation rerelease of the 1993 classic, and also including the expansion, Ultimate Doom, and its sequel, Doom II.\n\nIn this day in age, it's not that hard to take first person shooters for granted. They're EVERYWHERE in every shape and form on every system, literally clones of clones in a sense. What's even harder now is spotting the true gems that stand out within the genre. However, back in 1993 the FPS was unheard of commercially, and as difficult as it is to believe, the genre was a major revolution to gaming. Out of nowhere, the company iD Software showed up and introduced Wolfenstein 3D, the first real FPS. While it does stand as a gaming milestone of the early 90s, it didn't quite take off in the public. What did succeed however was their next project, which consisted of heavy weaponry, lengthy levels, demon slaughtering, BFG 9000s, and key collecting: the legendary Doom.\n\nAnyone who first experienced the game back in its height of popularity knows that Doom wasn't just a game, but a phenomenon. It has always consumed gamers (and continues to do so) into its ever addicting gameplay without compromise. The premise here is really simple: A base on Mars is attacked by Demons through a portal from Hell, and so the higher ups send the whole military platoon in to take care of the situation while you stand guard at the portal entrance. Of course, everyone gets wiped out except for you and now it's your job to go in and eliminate every last one Hell's minions. Yeah, it's a dumb story and it was eventually improved drastically with Doom 3 many years later, but the one aspect that makes these older Doom games superior to Doom 3 is that its simplistic storyline allows you to pick up the game from the get-go. There's no 30-minute CG cutscenes to introduce the game to you. There's no hour-long tutorial demonstrating how to play the game. No, immediately upon starting you're thrusted right into gameplay, and quite honestly I wouldn't have it any other way. Doom is to 3D what Contra is to 2D gaming: an instant, immersive, and entertaining experience, albeit somewhat mindless.\n\nOf course, most Halo and Unreal Tournament gamers of today will blindly slag off Doom simply because the game is old and because of its archaic graphics. Yes, the graphics do date this game a bit, plus its bloody, violent visuals look a lot more like a cartoon now than it did ten years ago, but people need to wake up and realize that a game is not fun solely based on how great the graphics are. The visuals are primitive, but you won't really care once you become immersed in the game.\n\nAnother common complaint about Doom from people now is that \"all you do is shoot monsters and collect keys\". True, newer FPSs offer different things to do, but people take Doom's simplicity merely at face value and they seem to miss the point. One thing that Doom has on most other FPS games is in its ingenious level designs. The creators really took the time to make its monsters, levels, and the overall experience memorable in a way that makes you want to come back for more. The differences between Doom and Doom II may only seem like cosmetic upgrades, but as the games go along, the mazes become more and more intricate and cleverly designed. Having story missions and goals to complete is fun, but not at the expense of completely non-linear gameplay. Doom never skimps out on this aspect.\n\nObviously the PC versions of the games are the best ones to play, but for those who happen to have a PS1/PS2 and caught onto Doom at a later date, this version will give you a real bang for your buck. With 2 games and an expansion, the whole package here offers about 60 levels, and 5 difficulty levels of nonstop action. One thing that is improved from the PC version is the sound. All the sound effects and monsters have improved noises, and all the droning level songs from the PC are replaced by an atmospheric, at times errie background soundtrack. As a Doom player for many years now, I believe this makes Doom that much better. Plus, the game feels very natural with a PS1 controller. Also, if you can ever find 2 PS1s, a link cable, 2 Doom games, and 2 TVs, the multiplayer option is well worth it.\n\nWhile other FPS games after Doom added a few new things here and there, very few were able to capitalize on Doom's greatest strength, which is its design. In fact, the only other FPS series to really impress me besides Doom is Half-life. I know that this review sounds like a bunch of praise, but a lot of the popular complaints are really nothing but hot air. However, I do wish that you could save the game via memory card instead of having to copy down passwords. That's my only gripe though. I give Doom my highest recommendation to open gamers looking for a challenge and a way to kill time. It's one of my all-time favorite games. In time, you too will agree that there's nothing quite like taking out a room full of zombie soldiers with a single double-barrel shotgun blast, jumping out of your seat as a group of angry imps pops out of a \"monster closet\"(hahaha), and dodging ferocious attacks by Barons Of Hell while you find health and attempt to take them out with a shotgun.\n\nReplayability: Very high. It's Doom.

For starters, you had some 60 superstars to choose from, including the biggest names around such as Goldberg and Hogan; all kinds of other hidden wrestlers also lay buried inside the game, waiting for you to win with certain characters (or use the handy dandy cheat codes) to unlock them-everything from made-up goofy characters to the wrestlers who got beat up for a living every week to announcers to members of the Nitro Girls (including the luscious Kimberly).  While certain basic moves worked for all wrestlers, each individual wrestler, including the hidden ones, had their own signature moves.  Thus, you could have Goldberg take his opponent out with the Spear followed by the Jack Hammer, or have Lex Luger turn a man into a little baby while hoisted up in the Torture Rack.  Each wrestler came with his own theme music and personal allegiance, but you had the option of changing a guy's alliance.  This could become important in terms of one of my favorite features of the game, the ability to have an ally come to the ring to help you avoid a loss or just to help you beat the heck out of your opponent.\nThe game offers a number of game types for one or two players.  You can fight an exhibition match or go for the TV Title, US Heavyweight Title or walk that aisle in pursuit of the World Heavyweight belt.  If you get tired of one-on-one action, you can choose tag-team play or battle it out with 29 other wrestlers in a Battle Royal.  You can even get down to brass tacks and battle it out in a cage match.  The only bad thing about a cage match is the fact that it does not allow you access to any weapons.  In normal game play, there are a number of weapons outside the ring (you control how many) that you can pick up and use to beat the fool out of everybody that gets in your way; you can even just keep wailing on your opponent after he hits the ground.\nWCW Thunder is and never was perfect, though.  For one thing, the game quickly becomes rather easy.  You can just pile drive your opponent over and over again into oblivion if you like or take a stop sign upside a guy's head a dozen or more times and pin him easily.  The clumsy combination moves actually become a good thing here because it is sometimes a challenge to perform that special killer move your wrestler is famous for and end the match in style.  The graphics are decent but not great, and my Playstation seems to have a few hitches in its gitty-up when it tries to render large numbers of wrestlers all at once in Battle Royal mode.  I still enjoy playing WCW Thunder, though.  It looks a lot like the earlier WCW Nitro game, but it plays a lot better in my opinion.  There are better games available now, even for the Playstation, but I have a feeling that I'll be enjoying this game on and off for many years to come.", "summary": "I do believe I am quite ready to rumble", "unixReviewTime": 1061337600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "4", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2004", "reviewerID": "A16YCLRKOU0EV3", "asin": "B00000I1BT", "reviewerName": "Jacob Joseph", "reviewText": "This game broke new ground for the video game industry, and not just for the violence, but for the environments and gameplay.

But despite all that, Doom is still one of the hottest shooting games in U.S. It's my favorite game on the PC. I play almost every day on my computer at home. I would love to own this game on the Playstation because, it is, by far, the best version of Doom ever!! I rented it from one of my local movie rental stores, and loved it.

John Romero is hailed for this classic game of monster hunting.  Read on to see why this is a classic.\nTHE GOOD\nWell, obviously it's the \"granddaddy\" of the genre.  You get an array of weapons, my personal favorite being the chainsaw.  There's nothing better than chopping up a red demon and watching the blood scatter.  The music is also VERY eerie, as if something is about to pop out at you (even though it never does to the extent of, let's say, Silent Hill).  Even though the graphics are outdated, the level designs are very well done and many of them are tricky and cleverly designed.

You have games today (not all of them, I'm not being politically correct, so bite me!) that all you do is... you guessed it, kill people.  Doom not only had you kill monsters (and with bloodlust), you had to find the right key to open the door, face MORE monsters lurking behind it, and work your way through seemingly endless labyrinths.  Sound hard?  Yes, but that's the idea; this is a prime example of the way a first-person shooter game should be done.  It's a shame that future games didn't follow a similar formula (although Red Faction and Half-Life are your best bets of today).  In any case, Doom is a classic and should NEVER be forgotten.

The game has a cartoon feel and the back of the box even says that, I usually love cartoons and this one fits the bill in terms of both comedy and graphics. The story is that there is this story teller for a king who kind of went off the deep end by saying he slain an evil wizard named Zarok. Zarok, who overhears this, decideds to declare war and horrified by this and believing in Fortesques (the story teller) story he sends him out to battle but Daniel goes down at the first shot with a welhelm scream and everything. 100 years later Zarok returns but so does Fortesque but this time the cowardly knight is a skeletal one.\nMediEvil's controls are a little awkward but once you get the hang of them it becomes quite nice, the atmosphere of this game is dark and gritty but not too much. As I said before the gameplay is a hack and slash type thing like God of War but less gory... much, much, much, much, MUCH less gory than that game and it does throw around puzzles. The game does beg for you to get every single chalice (collectables) by throwing in a lot of challenges that can make it easier to complete if you have a certain weapon such as enemies having an insane amount of health and would take literally forever to kill with your second to strongest sword. Because of this getting a 100% on this game is really easy and there is no bad ending for doing a No Chalice run if you so wish to do so.\nThe music is outstanding and some of it is memorable, one of my favorite tracks is the ending theme of this one, the music is compose of a synthesizer and other normal instruments.\n\nSo how would I rate this game, well I think this game is perfect and is and always on the number one spot of my top ten list of favorite games of all time. For that this game gets a 10/10 stars from me, music, gameplay, and graphics are always great and the controls are a bit awkward as I said but once you get used to it then this game is a blast.

Usually, I pick Cartman because he is the funniest one out of the group and has the best insults. They implemented the same humor they use in their TV show, so the sound samples keep you the most entertained. The point of the game is to save your town from evil turkeys, aliens, toys, clones, and what not. Each level gets kind of repetitive, so the game can be a little boring. There is not much variety to it, but let me reiterate that the voice samples do and will keep you entertained.

The exceptionally popular foul-mouth TV shows based on the fictional, yet epic adventures of Kyle, Cartman, Stan, and (the now removed) Kenny, four innocent little third graders (now fourth) in the snowy, mountain town of Colorado. It's a wonderful life; you have a gay teacher, a pimp-daddy chef, a best friend who dies more than 10 times a week, and all the Cheesy Poofs you could ever want. At least, until, killer turkeys, aliens, clones, and toys invade your town and try to take it over. YOU and YOU alon must prevent these attacks (or you could just leave the worthless town to be burnt, but then the game's no fun).\nLike all shooter's, I only enjoy this game with cheats. The master cheat for this game is \"BOBBYBIRD\", or, if you break it down, \"BOBBY BIRD\". It unlocks every weapon, level, and everything else your twisted little mind wants from this game.\nIn single-player, you assume the role of either Stan, Cartman, Kenny, or who I always pick, Kyle. Each comes with their own insults and comments. As you progress, you find Kenny, Cartman, and Stan, and they come with you, but you can't play as or with them. They just allow you to hold more weapons and item (I guess that's because it's four pairs of hands). Your first mission is to destroy the turkeys; and ultimatly, the gigantic, robo-turkey. Without cheats, you start with a snowball, or you can advance it, and make it a \"yellow snowball\" (and if you've seen Jackass, you know what that is). The other weapons are a cow launcher, a toy-machine gun, and more. Sooooo much more.\nThis game is a good game, but only if you're a fan of the TV show. Even though it would be fun if some people weren't, they'd still annoy everyone, complaining of \"bad language\" and \"foul humor\". Ignore them. If you're a fan, get this, or at least rent it.

I don't think it's smash worthy but I really don't think it's flush worthy either because it did probably one of the smarter things and totally copied 007 GoldenEye and gave it a total South Park twist.\nAs usual, weird stuff is happening around South Park like mad, killer turkeys are attacking the city, strange mutants are running around and crazy self propelled toys are out to get you as you take the baddest 8 year olds on the planet Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman on this strange, vulger and very gratuitous journey.\nI gotta say it, the game was funny and it made me laugh all the way through, especially if you ran across the Terrance and Phillip bombs! Other than that, I really didn't feel there was much else besides all the cool codes (like all the weapons codes and stuff) and that you could be so many people in the multiplayer mode like Officer Barbrady, Mr. Mackey (M'kay), Terrance and Phillip and if you really wanted to, Starvin' Marvin.\nThe story is really silly but then again, when is there an episode of South Park that isn't just plain out ridiculous? Exactly. The controls are pretty easy too. You can set it to GoldenEye style of control or for you advanced users, you can use a Turok type of control.\nI still gotta say that I wouldn't play it for it's story mode. Personally, I'd play it for it's multiplayer mode because that's what the game is really good at! That and I personally thought you could do a lot more in the vs modes rather than in the story modes.\nFor you parents, most of the swearing is bleeped out but a few \"choice\" phrases are in there so give it a thought before you buy it for your kids.

This dude named Griffin is in love with this girl, and then the government comes and takes her away. Meanwhile, gangster militias that are armed with Tanks take over the US and likely the rest of the world. Griffin vows to get his girlfriend back and save America from the various Tank gangs.\n\nGameplay: You play the entire campaign through in your stereotypical mock Abrams tank, blasting through enemy defenses and rescuing (or kidnapping???) women. Your tribal army needs women to stay in existence. Different gangs have different types of tanks. There are a variety of powerups for your tank like swarmer missiles, guided missiles, lasers, and gun buddies you can set down to defend areas. Most of the missions remind me of a multiplayer session of \"Capture the Flag\" from any number of FPS games. BattleTanx's single-player is unique in that regard.\n\nControls: They work pretty good. No complaints.\n\nMultiplayer: There's no co-op campaign. BOO! :P You can play through various types of matches (most of which resemble the single-player levels) against friends or the AI. You can use the tanks of enemy games in the multi-player. That's all good and well, I guess, but I know I can blow my friends to kingdom come.

Still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later.\n\nTwisted Metal 2: Most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically...\n\nTwisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral.\n\nTwisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1.\n\nTwisted Metal Black: First Playstation 2 release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name Incognito entertainment.  Best Graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games.  With nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now)  this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series.\n\nTwisted Metal Head On: This is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.", "summary": "Twisted Metal Series Review", "unixReviewTime": 1386115200}, {"overall": 3.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2013", "reviewerID": "A8F8RN6CMJN3A", "asin": "B00000I1C0", "reviewerName": "Andrew", "reviewText": "Its a bit harder than I remember it being and controls are rather awkward, takes a bit of getting used to... also, can't use analog setup.", "summary": "Good old game", "unixReviewTime": 1367539200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2013", "reviewerID": "AX9OGYDSOZ48N", "asin": "B00000I1C0", "reviewerName": "Caleb", "reviewText": "I have always wanted to have this game since it first came out.

After playing for a few minutes, a wave of memories came flooding back into my mind of the original vehicular combat game (well, besides Carmageddon), so I had to dust it off and throw it in the other day. To my surprise, I played for a couple of hours and found myself still enjoying it.\n\nIt looks awful. The controls are pretty unresponsive. The computer is unforgiving and the other cars are almost always at an advantage. So you must be wondering, why exactly did I enjoy this game? Maybe it was the nostalgia factor, but I think it was more of the fact that the game is so simplistic that you can jump right into it and play it without having to sacrifice a ton of time to do so. I beat the game in under an hour; there are only 6 levels to play through, each one amping up the difficulty. Players are not really rewarded for progressing through the game over multiple playthroughs. It is this lack of replayability that factors into my rating of the game.\n\nThe characters are memorable. There are 12 in total, each one coming with a ridiculous backstory.  Just about every one of these characters is balanced, offering enough of a challenge to make you think through your actions. Will you select Mr. Grimm, with his ultra powerful weapons, or sacrifice speed for a bruiser that can take a lot of damage, such as the monster truck? The bottom line is that there is something here for everyone.\n\nThe violence is so over the top that it's comical, rather than graphic. I won't focus on the story, because there isn't much of one. The game centers around an annual competition, in which the last \"man\" standing is granted a wish that he can use to get anything desired. I think it goes without saying that you're not picking this game up for the story line. At the end of the day, the game feels dated. Passwords take the place of save features, and the game has an arcade feel to it. The soundtrack is just good enough where it doesn't get annoying, but it is repetitive and far from memorable, having a heavy metal feel to it. In the end, don't expect to be overwhelmed by the games presentation. However, that does not mean that you shouldn't play this game if you haven't already done so.

There are many puzzles I still haven't solved and I may end up playing though again just to see whats there.  Also, some of the graphics were nice and I love the fear, even though I played RE's 2&3 first, this one scared me the most (but being the first I played, only RE2 gave me nightmares for months).  I will agree, this game is hard core, and there is plenty to like about it.  I love interactive movie feeling like Final Fantasy VII and Wing Commander: Prophecy.\nHowever, now I will list what I didn't like.  Why I only gave it three stars.  Well, to start off, the cinematics are not only outdated, but horribly done to begin with.  If I made the game, I would have just said: \"Y'know, that was really bad, let's just not have a cinematic.\"  Also, the movement is quite shabby and fake looking, and while a zombie hovers into a standing position, you can't shoot him until he is standing up and walking toward you.\nIf you think that such a picky thing about positioning, picking up items is worse.  You can commonly at a position in which you appear to be facing an item perfectly, but you can't pick it up, because it's really 30 degrees to your left or something like that.  With these positions, you are forced to listen to mind-numbing music.  I thought the sound effects were bad and the voice acting made the sound bad enough, but they had to go and give us the abolute worst soundtrack you will ever find, for any game or B-Movie.  The only trouble with the music is that you require listening to the sound effects to survive, and so you must endure the music as well!\nHowever, the music is beaten in abysmal-ness by its dialogue.  The script is terrible, and to say the voice acting is laughably bad would be a huge understatement.  It doesn't end there.  The pitiful dialogue scenes do nothing but tell one of the most cliche-ridden plots ever devised.  You have police traitors, huge creatures that come out of rooms that you just came out of to kill you, and worst of all, you have about three dozen times through the two stories (which are almost identical) where people walk in just in the nick of time to save the other.  That type of stuff makes me sick.  You are alone for about two hours, when suddenly a trap goes off, right as your partner happens to be right outside.\nLets rate everything: Images: 8,  Movement: 5,  Script: 1.5,  Sound Effects: 6,  Background Story: 5,  Music: 0.5,  Voice Acting: 0,  Puzzles: 10+,  Mosters: 5/6,  Weapons: 8,  Fear: 9.5,  Plot/Sequence of Events: -2.", "summary": "A Great Game With More Flaws Than Any Other Out There", "unixReviewTime": 979862400}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "3", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2000", "reviewerID": "A2ZJALA5LEQUPZ", "asin": "B00000I1BY", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "A.

From the \"House Of The Dead\" series to \"Silent Hill\", everyone has ripped off  Capcom's masterpiece. The story starts off in a city us hardcore gamers  will all know, Raccoon City. On a hill in an out-of-the-way area lies a  mansion that holds a deadly secret. Down in Raccoon City, the community has  had violent attacks by zombies that are bumpig off the townspeople. The  R.P.D. send out their S.T.A.R.S. unit to find out what's up with this  mansion and it's 'monsters'. Both the Alpha and Omega teams shall never be  the same....... What you encounter through this tale of death is nothing  short of terror perfetion. From your first encounter with dogs, to your  first boss, to your return to the mansion only to find your zombie pals  have been replaced with gremlins from hell called hunters; this is  horror-gaming nirvana. Your characters are Jill Valentine and Chris  Redfield. You get to pick which character you lead (or lead you) down your  path of hell. Jill is the easier one to use, while Chris is the harder one.  For example, Jill starts off with a pistol, while Chris starts off with the  forever dreaded knife. Basically their stories are the same with some  different twists thrown in here and there. For example, Jill's sidekick is  Barry, while Chris gets Rebecca. Throughout your journey, you pick up on  clues as to what's going on. Such as diary entries. You come across the  mansion twice, a backhouse, a garden, an underground passage way, and an  underground laboratory throughout your story. All the while you hear the  name of a corporation (one that will haunt you throughout the series) known  as Umbrella. The game isn't hard, but it isn't easy either. Worrying about  ammo and herbs is always the number one priority. Playing through the game  to see what's ahead (you know, horse around), then go out for real and work  your way through the story is the biggest tip I can give. And always save  (just don't over do the ink ribbons, there's only so many). The graphics  were breathtaking then and still hold up today. The control is difficult  for some to get used to, but I never had a problem with it. The sound is  also amazing, but quite important. Usually when I play games, I put on my  headphones (Nine Inch Nails for me) and play away. Unfortunately, I can't  do this. You need the sound to hear what's going on, whether it's zombies  that are lurking around a corner you can't see, or something following you,  you have to listen. This adds to the gaming element immensely. It'll often  scare you, but that's the point, adding a new gaming dimension. One of  fear. My only problem with the game, is the story of who originally owned  the mansion. ... Ultimately, Capcom scratched all that.  And it detracts from it all as the story behind the mansion has too many  holes. In the end though, this was a classic video game. Not the best  Resident Evil, but mandatory if you intend to play them all as the story is  missing a lot if you pick up on the series when it's already told so much.  It's graphic, it's bloody, it's epic, it's scary and it's an experience you  won't soon forget.

If you're alone and want to do a tournament match, you will fight and may win until you ask Calypso, the leader in the car combat series, for your ultimate wish to come true.\nIf you are someone who likes to battle the brawl on the urban side of town, then this game is for you.", "summary": "Miraculous", "unixReviewTime": 1031961600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2001", "reviewerID": "A2XOFC1VUX20ET", "asin": "B00000I1C0", "reviewerName": "MattMike", "reviewText": "Lets see, first don't get overly surprised by great levels and graphics because they are not.

It has a tiny roster (with only ten guys) that is EXTREMELY outdated, but I recognized most of the guys, several of them being among my favorite wrestlers. (The only one who was completely unfamiliar to me was Ahmed Johnson.) I think the graphics are really good although the wrestlers aren't very large on the screen, and the gameplay is done pretty well. No, the game isn't very realistic, but I think that just adds to the fun! Some people seem to have issues with the load times, but I don't really think the load times are bad at all. I've played games that have much longer load times! I think this game is much better than WCW Vs. The World (which is one of the only two other wrestling games I have for PS1), even though that game has many more guys on it!", "summary": "outdated and not very realistic, but fun!", "unixReviewTime": 1341100800}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "5", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2004", "reviewerID": "A2582KMXLK2P06", "asin": "B00000I1C3", "reviewerName": "Bryan", "reviewText": "WWF In Your House, while graphically WORSE than WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, should *not* be ignored if you like that Wrestlemania game because In Your House features the *exact* same arcade wrestling action.  The wrestlers have been updated too.\n\nYes, WWF In Your House is an old game with noticeably average graphics and not-so smooth animations.  It came out in 1996, I believe.  The graphics simply aren't as good as Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.  BUT if you're a fan of Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, I see no reason why you wouldn't like In Your House.\n\nSome reviewers claim this game is hard.  It's really not that hard once you remember the most effective and damaging moves. It's easier than Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.  In fact, if you consider yourself a fast gamer, you won't have ANY trouble with In Your House.  There's an option to put the game on easy, so if you must, put the game on easy.  Also turning blocking off helps make the game much easier.  Using the run button that's located at the top of the Playstation controller (I believe it's either L2 or R2, or maybe both) is a MUCH better idea than using the OTHER way of running (hitting two buttons at once- ugh!)\n\nThe loading time is somewhat worse than Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, but only somewhat.  In Your House takes maybe 3 or 4 seconds longer to load a match, if that.  Unfortunately, the way Vince McMahon introduces the wrestlers is pretty bland and uninteresting compared to Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game where you actually saw the wrestlers running forward, towards their opponents, featuring their own distinct animations (such as Shawn Michaels posing and Doink \"the clown\" squirting water).  In this game, Vince just SAYS who you're facing while a boring picture appears on screen showing the wrestlers.  It's not as good.\n\nYou get to play as 10 wrestlers, and each wrestler has his own set of unique moves.  It's better to try finishing off your opponent using the moves that drain the most energy.  That's the number one rule to winning.\n\nGoing through a World Title tournament in Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game takes about 10 minutes.  Here it takes about 20 minutes, because you have to compete in more matches.  It's not a problem at all, though.  If anything, it's better this way, because it's *so* much fun going through all the rounds and whipping out one devastating move after another.  Some of these moves are realistic, while other moves are too extreme for wrestlers to be able to perform in reality.  For example, the Ultimate Warrior shooting lightning and the Undertaker shooting some kind of demonic spirits at you.  It doesn't happen in real life.\n\nYou get to play as Shawn Michaels, Vader, Bret Hart, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, The British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith, The Undertaker, Goldust, The Ultimate Warrior, and Hunter Hearst Helmsley.  People may complain that this is a really small list of wrestlers to choose from, but it's actually better than the more updated wrestling games on the market today that feature WAY too many wrestlers that have no reason to exist.  At least with a small selection, you will be able to remember all your opponents main power moves.  Plus, giving you a small list of selectable wrestlers makes it feel more like a short and intense arcade game, which is the point.\n\nIt's probably the hardest going through the tournaments (all three of them) with Goldust because his energy seems to drain very quickly, and it's probably the easiest to complete these tournaments with Shawn Michaels or the British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith because they have MANY power moves that finish your opponent off very quickly.\n\nBut as I said above, this game is worse than Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game because the graphics and animations aren't in the same league.  But see, the thing is, In Your House and Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game are the ONLY arcade wrestling games with the WWE logo on them.  This means we only have TWO games like this that exist in the entire world.  Sure beats having a million slow-moving big and bulky 3D WWE games out there that have no major innovations implemented whatsoever to separate themselves, right?\n\nI have a lot of fun with these arcade style wrestling games, so realism doesn't matter to me at all.  I will take this game over any and all of the best-looking WWE wrestling games that are so popular today.  I prefer wrestling games that are FAST, and that's what In Your House is all about.  It's fast, exciting, unique and with practice, not very difficult to complete.  Who cares about graphics?\n\nSo, in short, I don't CARE that In Your House is sort of a low-budget looking WWE game.  This and Wrestlemania are the only games like it.\n\nAlso, the commentators, Vince McMahon and Mr. Perfect, have a LOT more things to say in In Your House compared to Vince and Jerry Lawler in Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.  Also worth mentioning: each wrestler has their own special thing to say at the beginning and end of a match.  Okay, so they don't say things ALL the time, but many times they do.\n\nBoth the Playstation and Saturn versions are great.  The Playstation version has shorter loading times, and plus I think the Playstation controller is better for delivering moves because of the simple button layout.  Also, there's a Sound Test option only in the Playstation version where you can hear all the sound effects and theme songs in the game.  I mean EVERY SINGLE THING you hear in the game can be found in the sound menu!  It's pretty awesome.\n\nThe Saturn version has a couple things that the Playstation version doesn't have, so don't worry Saturn fans!  Exclusive to the Saturn version includes an extra move for the Undertaker (in this version, you can deliver multiple chokeslams to your opponent - you can't do this on the Playstation version) and plus the Saturn version was created so you can perform finishing moves whenever you want, whereas in the Playstation version they can only be delivered during one-on-one matches.  It doesn't matter how many people you are facing on the Saturn version, you can deliver finishing moves at the end of every match, if you'd like.\n\nEither version is great though.", "summary": "Come on, In Your House is a fun arcade-like wrestling game", "unixReviewTime": 1103932800}, {"overall": 2.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2015", "reviewerID": "A2RHHGVF6YK8WT", "asin": "B00000I1C2", "reviewerName": "melissa steele", "reviewText": "this game is very boring there are around 30 wrestlers but only ten of them are real wrestlers you can only punce kick and do the signiture move  its not worth it at all", "summary": "not good wrestling game", "unixReviewTime": 1433289600}, {"overall": 1.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2014", "reviewerID": "ASCR6RUWOU1F9", "asin": "B00000I1C2", "reviewerName": "Kane&#039;s Review", "reviewText": "I don't get why so many people rate this a high game. There's nothing special about it at all. I got this game awhile back and thought it was pretty lame so the game went into retirement, until I decided to pull it out for the first time in many many years and play it and my thoughts remain the same.\n\nFor WCW's first video game made during the Monday Night Wars, this was pretty terrible. For starters, this is more of an arcade type of video game then a game you'd expect. The game came out in 1997, yet looks and feels like it was made in 1990, transferred to Playstation discs and called a video game.\n\nWCW vs The World was developed and published by Japanese companies, Asmik Ace Entertainment and The Man Breeze, which would probably explain why there are only 13 WCW wrestlers in the game, while the rest of the roster is fictional Japanese wrestlers. That's right folks. Only 13 WCW wrestlers, while the rest are made-up Japanese wrestlers that have never even remotely been heard of. It's kind of a waste of a game if you're not going to include all of the WCW roster and have a bunch of created wrestlers take up space.\n\nThe only arenas you can play in are house show like arenas. There's a WCW house show like arena and the rest are Japanese arenas. To add on to the Japanese theme in this game, there's cheesy music that loops throughout the matches that sounds like it would've been acceptable in a 1980s Japanese action movie. There are 7 different modes you can play in this game that are: League Challenge, Best of Seven, Exhibition Match, Elimination Match, Tournament, League Match, and Double Title Match.\n\nIt goes without saying that the move-sets in this game are also very limited. Each wrestler only has about 6 to 7 different moves for you to use until you begin getting bored. Ultimately, once you've played one match, you've played them all. Overall, this game is just horrible. It gets boring within the first 10 minutes before you want to cut it off. A similar WCW game, made and published by the same company would come out later that year; WCW vs NWO: World Tour for the Nintendo 64. It was slightly better than vs The World, but that's not saying much.\n\nBasically if you want to play a better WCW game than vs The World for Playstation, buy Thunder, Nitro, Mayhem, or Backstage Assault. Nitro and Backstage Assault weren't all that good but any following WCW game is 1000x more fun to play than this abomination that is WCW vs The World", "summary": "Worst WCW Game Ever Made", "unixReviewTime": 1402358400}, {"overall": 1.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2013", "reviewerID": "A4Z9NHOW5LT0M", "asin": "B00000I1C2", "reviewerName": "JoB", "reviewText": "I get it, it was one of the first games from PS1 but sincerely, this game is horrible.

Its the most devastating move ive ever seen in wrestling, if he does this in real life to other people, I would suspect these people often become paralyzed.\nI will attempt to describe the move, it starts off as a regular suplex, but once he has the guy verticle in the air, he releases him and comes down into a piledriver. So basicaly your being dropped directly on your head from 6+ ft in the air. A regular piledriver is like 2 ft and you have almost no momentum. Same with a tombstone piledriver.

Still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later.\n\nTwisted Metal 2: Most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically...\n\nTwisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral.\n\nTwisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1.\n\nTwisted Metal Black: First Playstation 2 release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name Incognito entertainment.  Best Graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games.  With nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now)  this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series.\n\nTwisted Metal Head On: This is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.", "summary": "Twisted Metal Series Review", "unixReviewTime": 1386115200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2013", "reviewerID": "AO3LPJG19T1D6", "asin": "B00000I1C1", "style": {"Platform:": " PlayStation"}, "reviewerName": "MetroCritic", "reviewText": "The Twisted Metal games in my opinion have seen their day since this gem was released.

For gamers raised on analog controllers, this game may be a little hard to manage at first. Also, the game, which emphisises stealth and patience is not without a frustrating moment or two, as the camera can be troublesome in places, and there is no in game save feature (try spending 2 hours working to get a good rank on a level, only to be killed by the level's extremely difficult boss, and be sent back to the begining...).

The games included on this collection are:  \"Ms. Pac Man\", \"Dig Dug\", \"Galaxion\", \"Phozon\", \"Pole Position II\", and \"Tower Of Druaga\".  For those who don't own a PS2, NAMCO MUSEUM VOL. 3 is worth owning because of \"Ms. Pac Man\", \"Dig Dug\", and \"Galaxion\".\n\n\"Ms. Pac Man\" is just as fun to play as the original \"Pac Man\" but is just slightly more difficult and gives a more continues the \"story\" begun in \"Pac Man\".\n\n\"Dig Dug\" is one of the classic arcade games of the 80s.  The game seems easy enough to play (dig your way through dirt, kill monsters before they kill you, and collect vegetables). However, the game becomes increasingly difficult as you progress and before you know it your running away more than you are shooting at monsters because there's just too many of them.\n\n\"Galaxion\" is another arcade classic.  It takes the premise of \"Space Invaders\" one step further so that instead of defending a planetary base from destruction and invasion, you're in space trying to destroy an enemy fleet before they blow you up.  In \"Space Invaders\" you could hide your gun behind turrets, but there is no place to hide in \"Galaxion.\"\n\nThe other three games on the collection are fairly forgettable and were somewhat obscure in the day.  \"Phozon\" is a type of puzzle game where you try to match up the phozons with the pattern without getting blown to bits.  \"Pole Position II\" is a racing game where you blow up if you get too far off course or run into items.  In that sense its realistic. However, the game is extremely difficult to play because the analog component of the paddle isn't compatible and you don't have a joystick so you're forced to drive your car using the directional buttons. What a pain.  \"Tower of Druaga\" is the final game on the collection.  It involves trying to get Gil to climb through all the levels of the Tower. It's kind of like an early video game version of role playing. It's kind of interesting, but it takes an incredibly long amount of time to defeat.\n\nOverall, this is a great collection for anyone who grew up playing video games in the 80s.

I never was able to get my hands on the first one but this one is amazing.\n\nThe Game:\n\n Twisted metal is a car compitition almost like demolition derby except with crazy characters and weapons. Many games have tried to copy this gameplay but none could ever create one like this. The competition is held by Calypso and he gets people in search of help to join his competition and if they win through the 8 levels of demolition they get one wish from him. Calypso is all in this for entertainment while the characters are in it for something important.\n\nThe Good:\n\n This game is one of a kind and has many good points. First of all is the gameplay. It is replayable and you can chose from any vehicle/character and take him through the end of the game and see his ending story. All of the characters are unique in an individual way and they each have their own special to terminate enemies. There are plenty of weapons to pick up and fire at opponents like the homing missile and fire missile and napalm. The levels are well designed and there are eight of them to battle through. The co-op mode makes the game especially fun but takes away the story aspect at the end. Also each vehicle makes their own sound when using there special.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n The graphics can be a little bit choppy at times and many of the obsticals are flat. Some of the story lines are not worth playing through the whole game, you just have to be careful who you pick.\n\nConclusion:\n\n Overall the game is excellent and is a must buy even if our deciding to buy it now and you have a ps2.", "summary": "One of my Favorite Playstation games", "unixReviewTime": 1151798400}, {"overall": 2.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2006", "reviewerID": "A3J30IG4AKOYY3", "asin": "B00000I1C1", "style": {"Platform:": " PlayStation"}, "reviewerName": "General Warthog", "reviewText": "TM 4 is better, seeing as you can access all bosses and play as one of them", "summary": "bah humbug", "unixReviewTime": 1147651200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2005", "reviewerID": "A3PPPKFRLJKP70", "asin": "B00000I1C1", "style": {"Platform:": " PlayStation"}, "reviewerName": "Hott Nikkels", "reviewText": "Now this one was way more fun than TM-1.

The game takes place in Feudal Japan; the game starts at the time period and impressively stays there through the entire game.

After watching the ending I believe that's the effect the creators wanted to put in this game, after seeing the end sequence yourself you'll know what I mean. Of course the bad camera angles sometimes made this game annoying. In order to block your opponent's attacks you must hold down which a lot of the time backed you into a corner....

I lent it out some years ago and never got it back. I recently noticed that the price is very modest so I picked it up again.  Why? This game is an older generation game (PS1), but it is better than some PS2 games I have played that only advertise graphics but have poor gameplay or short game time.  Tenchu is a satisfying game that lets you creep around, slice necks from behind, and hide out on rooftops. You will avenge the death of a crooked merchant, rescue a captive nijna, save a princess, destroy a fiendish cult, stop the spanish pirates, and fight a big boss with a bigger sword. Of course there are those who opppose this type of activity and thus will try to stop you.  Its lots of fun running around, hiding, killing from the unseen.  Its better while doing it while the great game soundtrack is playing.  This game has very catchy music that brings you you right in. The graphics, like I said, are mediocre, but that won't make or break a game anyway. Gameplay makes the game and this game has plently. Plenty of enemies to defeat, two selectable characters, a bunch of ninja items to utilize, and the percect amount of levels.\nWhat isn't so good about the game? Each ninja only has a small amount of stealth kills to use. There are plenty of regular attacks to be diverse but only 3 stealthy kills. One kill is rarely used due to the fact that you have to be iun front of you r enemy to use it which is dangerous because he will see you. You usually do the neck slice (yawn).  Another downside is that many of the ninja items you acuire will be useless.  Since you can only carry 4, you will take ninja stars, bombs, paralyzing rice cakes, and the grapling hook.  The others are junk or rare objects recieved as bonuses for completing the missions on a master ninja score. Again the graphics are dated. The enemy AI is a pretty stupid. You can run past an ememy warrior and duck behind a bush or tree and he won't know where you went.  He will look around himself quick and resume his patrols, \"Where are you!?\"\nIts still a load of fun and can be a challenge at first to get a perfect rating and unlock secret items. Replay value is pretty darn good. You might get tired of it after beating it with both ninjas, but you will get a taste for it some time later.  This game will not sit in a closet.

The Twisted Metal story is simple. Each year, a dozen-or-so misfits and malcontents meet for a battle royale in souped-up cars straight out of Death Race 2000. The last person alive gets any wish granted by Calypso, the man behind the Twisted Metal competition. Your job is to take control of one the these cars in a variety of locations and then blast your opponents to kingdom come. Graphically, the game is identical to the original Twisted Metal. On the plus side, the landscapes are richly detailed and the battlefields are complex. On the minus side, the texture-maps still look horrible up close and clipping and pop-in is still plentiful. The game also controls much the same as the original.

The PS1 Namco Museum series is a very interesting twist on the arcade compilation formula. The innovative things about these games is that you have the option of walking around in a literal Namco Museum, and there are doors which represent each game, whats awesome about walking around in the museum is that each door for each game you go into has excellent build-up and atmosphere to get you pumped to play the game, and since it is a museum, each game's room has a plethera of interesting history of Namco, for example, in the Dig Dug room, you can click on these action figures that are on display and they represent real toys that Namco actually produced. There are also these sort of tips and tricks scattered on the walls of each room, as well as more history other than merchandise. Its a brilliant idea, and luckily, this game has an amazing roster of games. It has Ms. Pacman, Dig Dug which is my favorite arcade game of all time, Galaxian, Pole Position 2, Tower of Druaga, and Phozon which is a really strange sort of puzzle game. Lastly, because of personal bias, this game means a lot to me. It introduced me to Namco and some arcade classics, and some of the museum locations invoked wonder and curiosity in me and they make me happy whenever I see them.

The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window. The other flaw is the level design. Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost. The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.\n\nAnother thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow! When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable. Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting. They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad. The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is.

The best answer I've come up with is that Sony Playstation had some smash hits that the Saturn did not have. Games like Tomb Raider, Twisted Metal, and Final Fantasy VII were mega-hits that Saturn did not have an answer for. One game came very early into the Playstation library and was deemed an instant classic by gamers and critics alike, and that game is the first Resident Evil game, the first true hit for the Sony Playstation.\n\nReleased by Capcom in early 1996, Resident Evil was unlike any game we had ever seen at the time. With an opening title screen that explodes in blood and symbolizes terror, Resident Evil is a game that truly doesn't reveal itself right away. You have the opening story cinema scenes that vaguely explain your elite police officers' reason for venturing out into strange territory in search of your teammates. One of your teammates is killed during the investigation of the crashed helicopter by a strange canine beast of sorts, so the actors run for shelter in a spooky looking mansion.\n\nI won't rehash everything about the game, but I believe it is important to try and recapture the feeling of the first time playing the game. It's pretty difficult to describe. The music is perfectly eery and sets the tone grandly with stringed arrangements you would hear in a suspenseful terror film. You walk around trying to find clues about what is going on in this strange mansion. Bizarre zombie creatures roam around desperately seeking to sink their teeth into your fresh blood, you try and find better guns to deal with these creatures, and you also try and find the keys to unlock the doors without knowing what terror lurks on the other side. On top of that, the seemingly haunted mansion has traps and strange puzzles that must be solved in order to continue finding your way closer to the end of the game, almost like a spooky mansion in a murder mystery. Horribly mutated dogs crash through windows when you least expect it, and the ammunition in the game is in a very limited supply, so you are forced to make snap decisions whether to stand and fight or run for safety. Scattered throughout the game are personal correspondence, diaries, and logs that reading will give you a clue to the ultimate mystery surrounding what the hell is going on.\n\nBefore this game, the story regarding Umbrella didn't exist. Ironically, this kind of makes the game more mysterious. In other games, we already know about the Umbrella corporation's role in the story, so this game is a unique experience of unraveling the truth. On top of that, this game takes place in the Spencer Estate Mansion, which is the perfect terrifying setting for this unique gaming experience. There's nothing wrong with the second and third games taking place in a Precinct, but a haunted mansion crawling with the undead is just perfect.\n\nChris and Jill are the playable characters, both with their strengths and weaknesses. Honestly, Jill's game is much easier. She gets the bazooka, which Chris does not, and is given the lockpick at the start of the game in place of having to find the Sword Key. Jill also has 8 inventory slots to Chris' paltry six, and because Chris has no lockpick, he has to find small keys to open the locked drawers for ammunition. Having a small key clogging one of Chris' six inventory slots is quite a nuissance, especially since Jill does not even have to bother wasting one of her eight inventory slots with the lockpick. Finally, the obvious reason for Jill's easier game is in her companion, Barry Burton. Barry is very helpful and will heal Jill from a giant poisonous snake, give her acid rounds for the bazooka, help her to get the shotgun and will even torch the massive Plant 42 for her, while Chris is forced to rely on the inexperienced Rebecca to learn to play piano, find serum for him, and mix up a potion to injure Plant 42. There are ways to alter Rebecca's actions to make her a bit more useful, but in the end her assistance is not as valuable as Barry's.\n\nToday, the polygon graphics that were so compelling during this age of gaming do look substantially dated, and the voice acting, which was considered atrocious even when the game was new, is laughably absurd. But who couldn't use a laugh after the horrors and suspense of playing this game?\n\nWe all know the storyline of the game, and most of us remember all the thrilling moments to the point where they have lost their sharpness over the years. But take yourself back in time for a minute and try to remember what this game felt like to you the very first time you played it when you were much younger, and games were much different. This game felt like nothing we had ever played, and no gaming experience was even close to what we got from the playing the original Resident Evil. Back then, there was still alot of social debate whenever a game came around that featured a significant amount of violence, yet Resident Evil was so unique in that it literally felt like being trapped in a scary zombie movie. There wasn't much debate surrounding the gratuitous amount of gore like there was with other games (Mortal Kombat), and instead gamers and critics were unified in their praise of the game's excellent and unique gameplay and experience.\n\nGamecube would later revamp the game with updated graphics, better voice acting, and many new thrilling surprises, but you just can't beat that feeling you got when you first popped in this game not knowing what to expect.

Tucker", "reviewText": "The original Resident Evil is the purest example of a survival horror video game. The newer RE iterations, while fun in their own right, are not survival, and some would say not even horror video games.\n\nResident Evil throws the player into an old, dilapidated mansion with the vaguest notion of zombies on the prowl. The original party is split up to investigate the area, and the player is left to find clues towards a path to safety.\n\nUnlike many games supposedly within the Survival Horror genre, Resident Evil hits the nail on the head with the notions of staying safe. Enemies are best avoided, as direct combat can result in being quickly overcome with zombies or being poisoned.\n\nItems are hidden throughout the mansion that detail just how the monstrous zombie outbreak started, and to a lesser extent details the lives of the individuals who lived there during the initial stages of the outbreak. There are pictures of their families and friends, their clothes tucked into their closets, and, on occasion, the zombified individual himself, trapped and desolate in a bathtub or a wing of his home.\n\nPlaying the game, one truly gets a sense of being stranded. In essence, it puts the player in the perspective of every human being there during the outbreak. You never know who or what has been turned, nor where those beings now dwell. Caution is the only priority, and this game capitalizes on that.\n\nWeapons are not found sitting out for any person to find. The player must actively search for items to aid in his or her quest. Guns are definitely there, but they would be about as well-hidden as a person living inside the mansion would have them. The control scheme may seem archaic now, but for the genre, the controls are spot on. Maneuvering through a hallway full of zombies should not be an easy task, and given the options presented, it really isn't.\n\nPuzzles are a central (albeit quizzical) part of Resident Evil's gameplay. In keeping with the survival elements, some doors are locked; to pass through them, the player must find the key. This involves searching room-to-room around the mansion, and solving the occasional puzzle. These elements are definitely well-aligned with the gameplay, but from a strictly survival perspective, some puzzles fit the scheme better than others.\n\nThe plot is weaved strongly through the course of the game. Many of your allies are found dead throughout the mission, consumed by the horrors of the mansion. Others are as desperate as ever to get out, while some are a bit too satisfied hanging around. The plot is advanced mostly through cut-scenes where characters interact with each other. The voices, as all know, are pretty hilarious (or bad, depending on your perspective). For the time, characters using voice-overs as opposed to text was revolutionary. Unfortunately, the voice acting didn't stand the test of time, and some of the more hilarious quips are almost inside-jokes among video game fans.\n\nThe graphics were definitely of the era. In 1996, this game's graphics would astound any who saw it. Twelve years later, they are clearly dated. Many games of this era can't stand the test of time (strangely, games of the 16-bit era age more much gracefully, and even modern games have become throwbacks to the visuals of that time period), but Resident Evil fares better than many Playstation titles. Many of the pre-rendered backgrounds are highly detailed and set the mood wonderfully. Given the polygon count of the day, its pretty easy to tell where your character stands against the backdrop, and conversely, where the enemy stands. Thankfully, the color schemes applied to enemy and ally serve to blend objects and backgrounds together seamlessly.\n\nThe sound is more forgettable than anything in this game. The soundtrack does serve its duty well in creating and maintaining a frightening atmosphere, but there's just not anything noteworthy enough to stick out after over a decade. The sound effects, while not fantastic, serve their purposes extremely well. Given the player's mood, one would still be prone to jump when a noise is heard off-screen.\n\nWith a game as old as this one is, it would be easy to find faults -- especially comparing those faults with current-gen gameplay mechanics and graphics. However, if one can allow themselves to enter the early PSX era, the true beauty of a game like Resident Evil can shine through. While not perfect, this game serves as the ultimate example of what survival horror is.

Let alone playing such a game for the first time in my long gaming history.\n\nThe music and graphics for this game are by no means good to todays standards. Back in the day as with Silent Hill they were top notch or very near it. As far as puzzles go, Resident Evil had both passable and challenging puzzles... nothing that took away from your gameplay or experience which was a nice touch.\n\nAs far as gameplay this Resident Evil game, Director's Cut, was my favorite up until Resident Evil 2 and more recent Resident Evil 4. As I said with Silent Hill neither game is better than the other but I would strongly recommend skipping this game for this system and get the Resident Evil Remake for Gamecube.\n\nThe remake enhanced not just the graphics but the over all story and appeal of Resident Evil, the original classic survival horror game. In closing I have to say that I graded this a 3 as I did with Silent Hill, they are two different kinds of scares and two different worlds but the graphics and dated sound leave me empty.

One of the main points of the story is the isolation and being alone searching for your fellow teammembers.  If there's 12 of them in all and the main idea of the game is isolation and terror you better believe you'll find some dead teammembers along the way.  The story is pretty much known around the world.  STARS Alpha team has been sent to investigate STARS Bravo team's dissapearence in the woods near a mansion that belongs to Umbrella.  The T-Virus (Tyrant) has been let loose and killed the employees turning them into zombies, and unleashing other creatures (Hunters AH!).  The game itself really isn't that long,  once you learn the puzzle solutions you could breeze through it in a few hours (for which you may be rewarded).  The Arrange mode on this Director's Cut version features different uniforms for Jill and Chris and some different camera angles and puzzle solutions.  Items will be switched around to different locations as well.  The overall \"scare\" factor of this game is pretty nil, but you might jump at a few spots.  The graphics are dated, sure, but they're basic and likeable.  You can tell what's going on and still see extra details (unlike the remake where the entire game is a pile of details upon the next pile).  One of the most famous  aspects of this game is the voice acting and FMV sequences with actual actors (if you even want to call them that).  The in game voice acting, when you actually find a fellow STARS member alive, is pretty terrible.  I'd like to track these people down and see if they haven't been murdered because of it.  The FMV sequences are pretty classic also, the opening is the same for eather game and the endings are different depending on who you save during your adventure as Chris or Jill.  FINAL NOTE:  I highly recommend this game (the Director's Cut version since it has 4 games total) even if it is extremely old to anyone!  The \"explicit scenes of blah blah) at the beginning of the load don't really make a difference as it's all squares anyway, but this game is actually REALLY fun to play through.

Everything that the first game got wrong; the second game got it right. The second game was released in 1997 as a PlayStation exclusive called Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back; obviously reference to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. This game is also available on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic to be played on either the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable or PlayStation Vita for only $6 so Id recommend getting that version if you are interested. Developed by Naughty Dog, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and distributed by Universal Interactive Studios, the second game was better than the first game in pretty much every way. The second game takes place immediately after the first one as Doctor Neo Cortex survives the battle against Crash in the first game and decides to use crystals to power the Cortex Vortex to take over the Earth. He decides to abduct Crash Bandicoot to gather the crystals making him believe he wants to use the crystals to save the Earth. We also meet Crashs sister Coco who is suspicious of Cortexs true intentions. Meanwhile, Doctor Nitrus Brio who was Cortexs right hand man wants Crash to gather gems so he could destroy Cortex and the Cortex Vortex orbiting Earth so we are presented with many people wanting to side with us, all with different intentions.\n The gameplay is a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across 30 levels to gather crystals and gems. The game takes place in a series of six Warp Rooms which as the hub areas of the game. Each Warp Room contains five portals leading to a level. The goal of the level is to obtain crystals and gems throughout the path. Crystals are placed somewhere along the path whereas gems are obtained by either destroying all the crates, or in bonus levels or secret levels; once you obtain the crystal or gem, you have to reach the end of the level, if you exit the level by using the start menu with a crystal, you will lose it. I guess they made it that way to be hard. Once you obtain all five crystals in a Warp Room, you then have to ride the platform in the center of the room to move to the next Warp Room, however you have to fight and defeat a boss character before gaining access. Ripper Roo is back as a boss who is one of the more interesting bosses as he goes from a genius scientist to a mentally unstable psychopath when Crash hurts him, I cant help but laugh at this. Then theres the fight with Tiny Tiger across floating platform that drop, the goal is to have Tiny be on that platform when it drops and in true cartoon fashion he floats in the air for about a second and then falls, I love that. I was kind of disappointed that the final boss fight was too easy, but whatever.\n The gameplay is like the first game except with new controls, Crash can now slide across the ground, perform a body slam, crawl on all fours and even slide across the ground and jump immediately to reach higher places. Some enemies can only be defeated by one of these methods so the game has strategy which is nice. The boxes are back which once again have to be broken in order to obtain extra lives and gems. But whats nice is you can die and still get the gem without having to restart the level like with the first game. A new famous box is the Nitro Boxes which explode upon any physical contact, but fortunately there is a green colored box with an exclamation mark on it that will explode all the Nitro Boxes in the level once struck. The game also features bonus levels which contain hidden boxes, extra lives and even gems.\n As a kid, I played the s*** out of this game. It was only recently I managed to beat it 100% because it is both challenging and fun, but its easier than the first game so if you were expecting a greater challenge, you will be disappointed, but the controls, smoother gameplay and the fact you can save anytime you want as long as you are in the Warp Room makes this game a far superior game than the first one.\n\nFINAL RATING: 9.5 out of 10", "summary": "It's awesome", "unixReviewTime": 1395014400}, {"overall": 3.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2016", "reviewerID": "A1ICREREXO9J81", "asin": "B00000I1BQ", "style": {"Platform:": " PlayStation"}, "reviewerName": "Frustrated gamer", "reviewText": "A decent ps1 classic but not really true 3d platformer like croc or mario64 of the same era.

Except Reiko who just walks off into a portal.. the other versions show what happens when he goes into the portal, he puts on his Shoa Kahn mask!!!! shame thats not in it.\n\nAll the codes and moves where the same, and I like the fact that the PRACTIVE mode allows you to press pause and choose a list that displays all the characters moves, fatalitys and weapens etc... tho, i'm really kind of sick of the combinations of move lifts, which makes it great to just go into the options, highlight \"continues #\" and hold down block+run untill it takes you to the hidden menu where you can turn on auto fatalitys and stuff.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say about the game is what it should have had included. It needed to be fixed so that the auto fatalitys worked like in MK: TRILOGY (All platforms EXCEPT the N64 version) where each button freformed a diffrent fatality (2 fats, freindship, babality etc..) that about it.\n\nThis game is one of the best head to head fighter games. Unfortunatly the team at Crapcom decided to make a billion versions of Street Fighter for every other system... talk about over kill... but they didn't wanna make one for the 64, so thats there loss, which means Mortal Kombat is the best head to head fighter on the 64 if you ask me.\n\nThis game is actualy converted to the 64 straight from the arcade and then extras where added in after that, which makes it better then the arcade. Like the fact you can play as Goro & Noobsaibot, and a skinless character named Meat (go to GameFaq,com for the codes)\n\nMK is the best head to head fighter on the N64 in this realm.", "summary": "Choose Your Destiny", "unixReviewTime": 1121817600}, {"overall": 3.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2005", "reviewerID": "A2QQHIY23PL7H3", "asin": "B00000I1B8", "reviewerName": "Simon", "reviewText": "Though officially the 4th installment in the MK series, Mortal Kombat 4 followed one upgrade game, a compilation game, and a Sub-Zero spinoff game, making it around the 7th actual produced game for the series. It was the first game to utilize a 3-D engine, and the first MK game to feature weapons combat.\n\nWhile the 3-D engine was a refreshing change of pace after the stale, sprite-based animation of the previous entries, in truth MK4 gets dull rather quickly. Without the 3-D engine, it's pretty much the same as previous installments, only with less characters and less finishing moves. The idea to finally drop the silly finishers like Friendships and Babalities was a good one, but once you go through all the finishers and stage fatalities, you've pretty much seen it all. The basic fight engine is solid, but feels a little too simplistic and generic. The pre-programmed combos were toned down, which should be a good thing, but after awhile you miss the 'wow' factor that came with delivering them. The sidestepping button doesn't really do enough to change things, and weapons are so easily lost that its not worth pulling them out except for the coolness factor.\n\nMK4's still decent and worth buying if you find a used cartridge around, but only because the N64 seriously lacked solid fighting games.

The PSX re-release of the 1996 survival horror game.\n\n  Back when the PSX was first released, the system didn't have much in the way of standout games. Of course, there were a few noteworthy PSX launch games like Twisted Metal, Doom, and Tekken, but for the most part, the PSX didn't have anything outstanding yet. Thus, Resident Evil was made. Taking influences from the earlier survival horror series Alone In The Dark, Resident evil took all of its aspects to the next level and eventually became one of Capcom's most successful franchises to date, ranking just behind the Mega Man and Street Fighter games. In fact, the original RE game was probably the first PSX game to make the system worthwhile before other important games were released in the following years.\n\n  Most everyone who's played the games already knows the story, but for those who haven't, here's a brief synopsis: A strange murder occurrence just outside of Raccoon City has caused Police officials to be suspicious, so they sent two Special Tactics and Rescue Squad (STARS) teams to go investigate. You play as either Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield, both of them surviving STARS members. The teams end up getting stuck in the mountains, so they eventually find themselves inside a huge mansion, where the STARS members discover numerous creatures such as zombies, mutilated dogs, giant spiders, and other monsters. These were all created due to Umbrella Corporation's disastrous T-Virus. As the game goes along, more important discoveries are made.\n\n  Now let's talk about the game itself.\n\n  Of the three PSX RE games, this one easily has the worst graphics. We're talking first-generation PSX graphics here, if that's any indication. The character models are all blocky and easily stick out from the otherwise highly detailed still-screen environments. These environments are navigatably 3D, but the camera angles sit at fixed 2D points, which can be both good and bad, depending on the situation. By bad, I mean that some angles hinder the view of the action. The monsters (especially the zombies) have very limited animation and models compared to the later games, and its limited engine prevents the game from having more than 3 monsters on the screen at one time (not including the crows). So the only real decent graphical aspects are the rendered environments. But even they don't quite compare to the detail in the following games.\n\n  The sound effects are good for the most part. However, the zombies come off sounding more like moaning old men than actual monsters, and the voice acting... dear god? don't get me started. It's so hilariously bad that it's just fun to listen to. The dialogue doesn't help things at all along with the horrible acting which is bad even by B-movie standards. One of my friends almost died of laughter the last time I went through the game. The music on the other hand, is decent and suits the mood of each area appropriately. It's nothing special, but it does add to the overall suspense.\n\n  The controls are something that most people either love or hate. It took me some time to get used to them, but now I have no troubles whatsoever. Most people that hate them don't seem to realize that RE isn't just an all-out action game, but rather an exploration puzzle type game with action segments. The controls were a bit rough here, though they have been more refined in later releases. I do admit though, that it does get very tedious backtracking to the item box again and again because you can't hold all the items you want to. Between the two playable characters Jill and Chris, I personally found Jill to be the better one to control because she has more inventory slots and weapons than Chris, although Chris's voice acting isn't quite as nerve-grating as hers is. Both characters each have their own sub-character that helps them along game, such as Barry who helps Jill, and Rebecca who aids Chris.\n\n  Most people have said that this game was the scariest of all the RE games. I'm not sure I agree with that, but the atmosphere can be quite chilling at certain points. I suppose that the dogs breaking through the glass windows could've scared newbees to the series, but since I was introduced through RE2 and the fact that I've already played the MUCH freakier Silent Hill games, the original didn't scare me nearly as much as it should have. To the game's credit though, it does present the most puzzles, and a majority of them are real brain-benders. It's something that the series started to get away from as time went on. Plus, I thought that the game itself felt larger than all the others in the series, so it will take a while for new players to beat it. The challenge is also very high since there is very limited ammo to take out the creatures with. Even veteran RE fanatics still find the first game to be thoroughly challenging enough to come back for more.\n\n  This version of the game is a director?s cut edition, but it?s really nothing special. All we get is an extra mode that is more challenging and features different outfits for the main characters, but if you already own the original, there?s no need to get this version. Apparently the Japanese version also had extra cut-scenes, so we were cheated! So much for it being a ?director?s cut?, huh?\n\n  Although this game is extremely dated by today's standards, it's still worth checking out if you're a big fan of the series and want to see how the series got started in the first place. However, it's not really necessary now that a MUCH better remake is available on the Gamecube, so I suggest looking into that game instead. RECOMMENDED SPECIFICALLY TO FANS OF THE SERIES.

Definitely the best fighting game for the fading N64 platform. It is somewhat easy on the easy settings (almost too easy mind you), and as you increase the challenge level, the computer opponents increase in ability almost 10 fold.\nThe only gripe that I have is that some moves are just not condusive to being made on the N64 controller. My hands also wanted to keep sliding over into the traditional n64 grip on the controller (with the stick and not the pad), but this game does not play well with the stick and thus you have to use the pad. That will feel weird at first. You can re-map the buttons to better suite your needs, but if you do, other moves will be more difficult to pull off as well. For instance, Sub-Zero's famous slide is almost impossible to do without taking your right hand off the controller and repositioning it on the correct buttons to make him do his slide. While you're doing this, you're getting your butt kicked because how are you going to concentrate on where the buttons are during the fight?\nI still give it 5 stars because those problems are not really that significant in the long run.

Though I own nearly every non-GameCube title in the undead thriller's history, I'd never been able to stand one long enough to actually complete it, right up until this past week. I'd always found the series to be misleading, disguising itself as a straightforward action title before slowing the gameplay down to a crawl and relying on endless puzzles and feats of memory to lengthen completion times. Time after time, I'd sit down with the goal of finally tackling these games, and time after time I'd get bored, stuck or distracted, leaving the game behind. I grabbed Resident Evil 3 when it was relatively new, and the title has sat, unplayed, on my shelf for years. That was, as I said, until this past week, when I sat down with renewed vigor and vowed to complete the first title in the series, even if it drove me to madness.\nI'll make it really blunt; the story is absolutely terrible. The uninspiring characters meander their way through the events without a care in the world, occasionally encountering plot holes large enough to drive an oversized bus through. Nagging issues, such as why somebody would lock their home's single shotgun away in a room that's only accessible through a string of unrelated tricks and puzzles, aren't even touched upon. What if somebody breaks in, in the middle of the night? Is the owner of the mansion really going to have time to roll out of bed, run downstairs, jog to one side of the house, move around a couple statues, grab a key, run to another corner of the house, open a door, grab a fake shotgun, return to the original side of the house, unlock the doors and replace the \"real\" shotgun with the fake? I suppose the story does the right thing by failing to even mention these things, but they'll still tug away at the back of your mind as you play.\nThe graphics of the first Resident Evil really haven't aged well. Humans and zombies alike wander around stiffly and unrealistically, each one looking almost identical to the others. Polygon models are simple and blocky. Textures are pixelated and undetailed, looking more like a game assembled on the Super Nintendo's SuperFX chip than a PlayStation title. The series' characteristic pre-rendered backgrounds are poorly compressed and difficult to navigate in places, forcing players to turn out all the lights and squint their eyes just to make their way through the room. Merging still images with live polygons, Resident Evil plays like a strange amalgamation of the PC classics \"Myst\" and \"Alone in the Dark.\"\nThe bread and butter of any console title, its gameplay, is the one area where you'll really learn to love or hate this series. Rather than bothering with camera angles and awkward environments, Capcom has instead sent players through a series of screens, occasionally containing interactive elements of their own. You'll control Jill or Chris from a series of dramatic angles, never in control of the camera itself. They'll enter a screen on the left side, mosey around a little bit, kill a couple zombies and leave the screen on the right side, immediately entering the next screen from another direction. Though it was a somewhat novel concept at the time of its release, this scheme brought with it numerous problems, the most notable of which was your interaction with enemies on the next screen. It's not uncommon to run full throttle off the edge of one screen, only to find a zombie waiting for you right at the edge of the next. It's a really cheap way to take a hit, and can mean a speedy, frustrating death in later stages.\nLooking back, the control scheme employed here is notably revolutionary. Rather than applying a more traditional platformer's control layout, Resident Evil introduced gamers to a stationary rotation-based configuration. Left and right don't serve to strafe, they stop the character's movement altogether and rotate them left or right in place. Up moves you forward, and down moves backwards. Pressing R1 draws your weapon, and pressing X at the same time fires. It's a scheme that's more appropriate for the kind of stationary gunfighting and marksmanship that's defined the action portions of this series since day one.\nMany of the tricks and puzzles buried within the mansion aren't so much brain teasers as they are time wasters. You'll realize what needs to be done within moments, but chances are good you won't have the piece needed to do so on your person. It took me about six and a half hours to beat the game for the first time as Chris, cautiously walking around, learning the position of the zombies, figuring out the puzzles, groaning as I realized the piece I needed was sitting in a chest, fifteen minutes away, and repeating that process. The second time through, playing as Jill and remembering which random item I would need where, I finished in three hours and twenty minutes. That's one heck of a variation.\nThe soundtrack to the first Resident Evil is really something that's difficult to categorize. Imagine, if you can, a blend of symphonic suspense, the song that plays when you push \"demo\" on a keyboard, and elevator music. That's Resident Evil's melody.

It was the first in it's time.  The first game to have actual 3-D characters, rather than the suposive 3-D design that \"Doom\" and \"Duke Nukem\" bragged about their choppy, cardboard design.  Now that the movie of \"Resident Evil\" is out, kids and teenagers will be rushing out to buy the RE games.  For an aparent reason, the original RE isn't being sold anymore, rather that it's very, very rare and probably costs around 70 to 80 dollars.  Instead, they're is the Director's Cut. The DC is a odd version of RE that most people will be mistaking by the name.  No, it isn't more gorier, and no, Deleted Scenes not included; seriously.  Originally, the DC version had a much more explicit graphic beginning, with blood and all.  But due to censorship and problems with young kids bying M-Rated games and watching R-Rated movies, the scenes were cut out.  The only real different thing about the Director's Cut is the different costumes availible and items are in different spots. This will leave already RE owners high and dry, while satisfying non-RE game owners.  Anyways, the story.\nIn RE, a group of Special tactics commandos, known as S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) are dispacthed to a secluted mansion in the middle of a remote forrest.  The mansion once harvested top secret government experiments, lead by a Evil Corporation known as \"Umbrella\".  After the first squad, Bravo Team, was shot down from their helicopter and diseapeared without communication.  The second squad, Alpha Team, was sent to rescue them.  But a few scuffles with unknown creatures, leads their helicopter leaving them in the middle of the forrest.  In panic, the team finds refuge in the mansion. But little does the team know is that their troubles just begun.  You have the choice to either play Chris Redfield, a ex-marine turned SWAT commander, or Jill Valentine, a strong guided commando with the ability to pick lock doors and locks.  Through out the game, you must survive in the mansion. Your enemies are Bio-infested Zombies....that's right, zombies.  The problem; you're running low on ammo.  The story goes together, much like the basis for Sam Raimi's \"Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn\" or George Romeo's \"Night of the living Dead\".

The thing is Warped was the only one I had on hand when the urge to play these titles struck, and well, it completely spoiled me. I'm sure people are probably sick of me gushing over it but Warped was an excellent product and it was refined to the point of near perfection that I honestly wouldn't hesitate to give it a ten out of ten in conversation or review.\n\nThe problem with Cortex Strikes Back is it isn't as polished as you'd expect. I don't mean this in a superficial way like graphic fidelity (which is superb for when it was released) but a \"streamline all the cheap-shots out of the experience\" way. The level of cheapness ingrained in Crash 2's gameplay is simply astounding and it comes from a variety of places. Things like the hit detection on the belly flop are in dire need of work and the bonus areas are usually the furthest thing from fun when that's the exact opposite of what they should be. Worse yet are the game's hidden paths which are essentially sorry excuses to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the player. The kicker to is just when you think you're done and your guard is down - that's when they throw the kitchen sink at you.\n\nThe above situation is a real shame because when you get right down to it Cortex Strikes Back is a beautiful game. The level design and music are excellent as are the graphics which I feel even give Nintendo 64 games a run for their money. But every time the game turns a corner and those memories of the game's stubbornness start to fade something (again, there is always something) shows up and makes it take center stage once again. Compounding the situation is the fact there really isn't enough variety in the levels. Seriously, if I see another level with the words \"Crash\" or \"Bear\" in it I am going to scream and the same goes for the jet pack levels.\n\nAnnoyances aside, if your a fan of the PlayStation having the three main Naughty Dog-developed Crash titles in your library is a no-brainer. If you haven't played them and want to do yourself a huge favor and play them in order so you'll be able to appreciate the improvements each sequel brings with it. Unlike some franchises the first three Crash games get better and bolder with each step. As for the game being discussed here, Crash 2 leaves a lot to be desired to in my book but then I can't really say I dislike it either. I do wish it was a little better (polished) than where it stands now but then that probably a part of why Warped is so good.

The control in the other versions is impossible at times, and a bugger to learn if you are a first time player.\nThe game by itself is excellent. Lot's of puzzles, and lots of Zombies to shoot down. There are times (many of them, actually) where you much be careful how many zombies you shoot, because you can run low on bullets very quickly. The story is standard for any Survival Horror game: A group of soldiers are locked in an old mansion that is infested with zombies. An evil company has eperimented with a chemical that turns people into zombies, and the fallout turns the WHOLE TOWN into zombies. To survive, you must make your way through the mansion, and solve all the puzzles. This is definitely a challenge, and one that can be frustrating at times, but rewarding once completed.\nHere are the pros. The graphics are superb. The detailing of the zombies and the surroundings give you are real sense of dread, and yes, the blood flow is well detailed, it sprays when you are wounded. The music is ominous and ambient, giving just the right mood to the situations you come across. The story is also well put together, even though anyone who has seen George Romero's \"Living Dead\" trilogy (and what horror fan hasn't?) can get a sense of deja vu. All these elements make this a game well worth getting.\nNow for the cons. This game is not the toughest game for the Playstation, but it can be darn frustrating when you get stuck. Sometimes, a puzzle is very tricky and requires you to back-track just to see if you missed anything. This adds much more time to the game, but not in a good way. There is also the frustration of running low on bullets when there are three zombies coming towards you. Each zombie requires about three bullets each to finish them off, but bullets are so scarce that you must conserve. Also, the acting and dialogue is so hammy that it is comical, and you feel compelled to just skip through it so you can get back to killing zombies.\nOverall, this is a great game with a few shortcomings. But then again, nothing is perfect. If the Survival Horror concept sounds appealing, then you should check this one out.

This review will really help for someone who has played RE2 but is wondering what RE DC is about. Well, you've came to the right place.  First of all, here are the facts:\n1. Each zombie takes 5 shots NO MATTER WHAT. (with the Beretta)\n2. Jill is a blonde all though she doesn't look like it (a very dumb blonde)\n3. BARRY HAS A MAGNUM AND HES PROUD!!!\n4. You have to kill zombies up to four times if you leave the room when you shoot them down. (that means they come back alive once they are dead and you leave the room...the just pop up!)\n5. This game has hilarious dialogue!\n  Well, speaking of dialogue, the grammar is also very bad...and I mean VERY bad. Examples are: (when you pick up the 1st floor map)  \"You got the 1st floor map\"  RE2 says \"you've taken the 1st floor map\" that makes more sense.  \"You got the acid rounds\"...funny sometimes. Also, what I found is that Jill doesn't know what blood is. Barry is inspecting a pool of red liquid on the dining room floor. Jill comes over and has the nerve to ask \"What is it?\" and she stays there and studies it...??? Barry replies with \"I THINK it is blood. I hope this is not Chris's blood!\"  And they have exaggeration at the completely wrong times. But when there is a big monster coming they just talk \"wow. its a monster. what do we do?\"  and when there is like a door that doesnt open (during movie scenes) they say \"THIS DOOR WONT OPEN!! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO??\" Also, a really hilarious part is when Barry hands Jill the acid rounds Jill says that he should keep them for himself, and Barry replies \"No that's okay...I have THIS!!!\" And holds up his Magnum...I laughed my head off...he sounded so stupid! No offence to the makers of RE or anything but it is just so funny!\n  Another fact is that the camera angles are bad, but the puzzles are harder. Hmmm? Resident Evil is a very very very good game...but it is just the dialogue and camera angles...ive been talking it down but now its time to tell you that it is DEFINATELY worth getting, despite it's happy mediums.\nSo theres a few final things I have to say here:\n1.

Now why do I say that?  Well basically this is not a Directors Cut because capcom messed up.  The only people who officially got a Director's cut is Japan and thier initial release of Biohazard (Resident Evil in Japan).  What we are missing is actually about 14 seconds in 2 different videos you see thru the game.  In the opening video, 10 seconds is missing which actually makes the video more graphic when Joseph dies by one of the zombies dog's and some of the characters are smoking.  In the second video where you meet your first zombie, you see a more graphic depiction of the zombie eating Kenneth.  But is it really worth it?  Most Gamers don't even know about it much less care, but collectors and true fanatics are really steamed about it.\n The STORY is very well done I can say.  Even though it does not really keep pace within the game, it is very interesting and revives a cult classic monster....zombies!  Vicious murders have plauged the town of Racoon City and it is up to the S.T.A.R.S (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) to find out where the source of these murders are coming from.  You take on the role as Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine and attempt to investigate a house infested with things that go bump in the night.  Get ready to immerse yourself in the game that started the genre - Survival Horror.\n The GAMEPLAY is what to can be expected from a game like this.  You will be jumping and many scenes in this game for it will spook the life out of you.  I know you are saying...this is just a game....its more than that, trust me.  You basically navigate your character throughout the game solving various puzzles to gain access to different areas.  You will find plenty of ammo and weapons to help you battle the many monsters you will come up against.  Other S.T.A.R.S member will be around to help you out....others will try to block your way.  Although the controls are very hard to get used to, eventually you can compensate in many situations.  You will battle zombies, dogs, crows and the dreaded M-121A's....the Hunters.  But don't think you won't have the weapons to defend yourself for you will be armed with 9mm, shotgun's, a Colt Pyton and a fantastic Missle Launcher.\n The GRAPHICS are what to be expected for this game.  I personally saw no problem with the graphics.  Many people complain about the camera angles, but to me the camera angles added more spook to the game.  The Hunters still looked scary as heck with the limited graphics.  Many of the cutscenes are shown within the game engine, but the opening and ending actually have real actors.  Yes the dialouge is cheezy, but what do you expect?\n Overall I really enjoyed this game even though it took me a long time to get around to playing it.  I still cannot get over how much Wesker in the opening movie looks like Val Kilmer from Top Gun.  It had me jumping in a lot of areas and the puzzles were not too difficult.

For those who don't know, Crash Bandicoot is a fictional Eastern Barred Bandicoot who was genetically enhanced by the evil Doctor Neo Cortex who then escaped and set out to stop the evil scientist and his plans. Crash would appear in many games, but the ones I hold dear are the original three on the first PlayStation: Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. With that said, lets take a look at the first one in the series.\n\nThe first Crash Bandicoot game was released way back in 1996 with Naughty Dog developing the game, Sony Computer Entertainment publishing it and Universal Interactive Studios being the distributors. It was a PlayStation exclusive, but would eventually get re-released as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store to be played on the PlayStation 3. The game is definitely kid friendly and appropriate for all ages, Crash Bandicoot is basically a Mario ripoff but a very good one none the less who came up with several original ideas. The story goes that Crash Bandicoot was created by Doctor Neo Cortex and his henchmen Doctor Nitrus Brio. Crash escapes the experiments but leaves his girlfriend Tawna in the process and Crash is swept up to an island and sets out to go rescue her and stop the villains. Whats weird is that this is the only Crash Bandicoot game on the PlayStation in which Tawna appears in, I don't know why though, its definitely unusual. But nonetheless, lets continue with the game.\n\nThe first thing that stands out are the graphics, the graphics for 1996 looked fantastic, they were even better than Super Mario 64 on Nintendo 64 which was released a month later. It definitely gets an A+ for presentation. The game was a huge hit and was the first non-Japanese game to achieve commercial success in the country. Now, lets discuss the actual gameplay.\n\nThe game is nonetheless a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across three islands to defeat Doctor Cortex and rescue your girlfriend. The game is split into levels with one basic goal: get to the end without dying. You start out with four lives and its one hit deaths from being touched by enemies or falling into water or a pit. Yeah, its weird how water kills Crash even though he fell in the water at the introduction and was floating away to one of the islands and survived. Why is it that these characters who are very athletic cant figure out how to swim? I hate games that do this because when you see water, you're never sure if the game will allow you to swim. Its stupid and whats weird is that in the third game Crash does swim underwater with scuba gear. So really the game is a huge contradiction of itself.\n\nYou can get more one ups by finding them across levels or collecting 100 apples which are basically the coins of Super Mario Bros, but the apples are everywhere in this game so its really easy to get a one up, you could literally get at least three lives per level. Attack moves include jumping in the air and landing on an enemy or using a spin move in a tornado fashion to knock enemies off-screen, I like that, even if its a rip-off of Super Mario World. You also find this Mask that helps you on your journey, if you find it, it gives you an extra hit point, but you don't actually wear the mask it just follows you. If you get three masks without losing one, you turn invincible for a brief time much like the Starmans in Super Mario Bros.\n\nThe boxes are also a rip-off of Super Mario Bros. in which they have question marks on them and you have to destroy the boxes to gain prizes. But not all boxes are the same, there are boxes without question marks, arrow boxes that propel you in the air, boxes with exclamation marks which makes boxes appear out of nowhere, checkpoint boxes that act as a save spot for the level and TNT boxes which explode after three seconds when you jump on them, whatever you do, don't spin attack them because they will immediately explode.\n\nA strange feature in these boxes is that you can get Tawna tokens that act as a bonus level so you can get some extra fruit and one ups. Whats weird is that Tawna is in this level but she doesnt let you rescue her for some odd reason, but whats even stranger is that completing the bonus level is the only way to save the game or get a password. I don't understand why early PlayStation games didn't allow you to save anytime you want. Every video game that can support a memory card should do that, I hate writing down passwords so I can continue. But the password is only eight digits and the main buttons on the PlayStation controller act as the characters so its at least not a long and annoying password.\n\nIf you complete an entire level without losing a life and manage to destroy all the boxes, youll get rewarded with a gem, this was a flaw with the game because it makes the game way too damn hard and every future Crash Bandicoot game let you get the gem even if you die as long as you break all the crates. Some gems can act as platforms to help you get across areas that are impossible to reach, much like the vine in Super Mario Bros.\n\nNow while this game has some flaws, its still a good game overall, its not as good as the second and third game, but its definitely fun and enjoyable. The creativity is good, has a good challenge and the graphics are fantastic. If you have a PlayStation Network account, give this game a chance, its only $6 on the PlayStation Store so its not expensive or anything. Its definitely a classic.\n\nFINAL RATING:  8 out of 10", "summary": "It's good, not great, but good.", "unixReviewTime": 1395014400}, {"overall": 2.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2014", "reviewerID": "A1K9VDWEOWSV65", "asin": "B00000I1BQ", "style": {"Platform:": " PlayStation"}, "reviewerName": "Talitha Snyder", "reviewText": "On hog ride.

Stories of these mythical beasts have been passed down for generations, with each culture passing down different stories about these flying animals. The 2 cultures have intertwined in recent years, due to more contacts throughout the world. Although it is difficult to pinpoint exact origins for these creatures, they have still remained popular through various mass media, such as books and films.  This game, however, is not the average dragon story.\n\nWhat This Game is All About:\n Spyro is the little dragons name and flaming minions is his favorite game. At the beginning of the story, the player watches a cut scene with an elderly dragon answering questions for an unseen interviewer. He mentions how there are 6 worlds in the dragon kingdom with 14,000 gems worth of treasure. There is also a very mean guy, who guys by the name of Gnasty Gnorc. After the dragon says some rude insults about Gnasty, Gnasty gets mad. Gnasty fires spells at all of the dragons in the Dragon Realm, freezing them all to stone. He also turns some of the treasure into his personal minions, which account for the enemies that Spyro must face throughout the game. It is up to him to restore order back to the Dragon World.\n\n The objective of the game is relatively simple: free dragons, find treasure, and defeat Gnasty Gnorc. In order to free a dragon, Spyro just has to walk up to him, however, not all of the dragons are just located out in the open. Some got frozen in very unfortunate spots, making the journey a little more difficult than expected. There are a total of 80 dragons to free, with between 12 and 16 scattered through each world. There is also 14,000 gems worth of treasure. The gem values are as follows: Red=1, Green=2, Blue=5, Yellow=10, and Purple=25. These are the 2 main collectables of the game, but there are also dragon eggs. Thieves run around taunting Spyro about how they have an egg, which in retrospect isn't a very smart thing to do to a dragon. There are 12 eggs scattered throughout the first 3 worlds, while the last 3 worlds have the little rascals running around with treasure instead. All of this count towards 100% completion of the game, and the player needs a set amount in order to progress to each world.\n\nGameplay:\n Spyro controls rather well, but there is one constant problem throughout the game; the camera is, to put it frankly, garbage. Maybe that is a little harsh, but after 6 worlds of it, it gets on someones nerves. It is especially annoying when I glide, by hitting the X button twice, and I cant see where Im going, so I end up falling to my death. The player can control the camera with L2 and R2, but it doesnt go very fast, so he or she ends up having to wait for it to catch up with him or her. As for Spyros moves, they are swell. He can charge at enemies or flame them, but he cant just do this to every enemy. Some enemies have metal, so they must be charged at, while others are too big to be charged, so they must be flamed. Although the enemies are different in each world, this is the basic pattern, but it doesnt get redundant. Some of the enemies animations are actually pretty funny.\n\n Spyros health system is unique. He has a dragonfly, of course, that follows him around. Every time Spyro takes a hit, his color changes, from yellow to blue to green. When Sparx, the dragonfly, is gone, Spyro has one hit left. Spyro can refill Sparxs health by attacking local animal fodder, which release butterflies to heal Sparx and, therefore, protect Spyro. It is a unique system.\n\n There are 6 levels in each of the first 5 worlds. There is a hub level, which leads to the other 5, a flying level (more on that in a bit), 3 main levels, and a mini-boss level (more on that as well). Each level has treasure for Spyro to collect and the only levels that have no dragons to free are the flying levels. The main levels are fairly linear, but they have some diverging pathways for Spyro to explore (and maybe find some secrets, too).\n\n The flight levels are a blast. Spyro starts out flying, and he has to go through, burn, or destroy 32 different assortments of objects, with 8 objects times 4 types. The player is timed, but getting each object adds more time. While these levels are all under 2 minutes long, they are still fun, but there isn't much incentive to replay them for a better time. The record should be its own reward, but there are only 5 of these levels, and the player can only view them by going back to the level. Aside from that, they are still very fun.\n\n The bosses in the game are severely lacking. The only boss that must be defeated is Gnasty Gnorc, so the other 5 are entirely optional. They are usually located towards the middle of the level, with each hit Spyro marks upon them driving them closer to the end. The fights are okay, but I feel that something couldve been added to make them more worthwhile, instead of just being a chase and burn battle.\n\n There are 2 power-ups in the game that Spyro can obtain. The first is a super charge ability, gained by running on super charge tracks. These are used very effectively to find some well-hidden secrets. The other isn't as apparent, but it is still fun. It is a super flame that is granted by a fairy. This ability allows Spyro to burn metal objects and enemies, along with making him red. Both are fun and well used.\n\nThe gameplay is still awesome, but they couldve most definitely refined the camera, and maybe done a better job with the boss battles, but all in all, it is still fun. Something that must be mentioned, however, is the final, bonus level. The player must already have 100% completion, but it is completely worth it. Without spoiling anything, just know that it is the best level in the entire game.\n\nStory:\n There isn't much story to the game. There are a few laughs gained with the enemies, but nothing heavy in the story department. There are only 3 cut scenes in the game, so that should be a notice. This doesnt detract too much from the main experience, but it also doesnt help by not having much.\n\nDesign:\n The levels are designed nicely. It isn't anything amazing, but it is still very nice to look at. The enemies, however, are designed very uniquely. My favorite design for the enemies is the design used for the last, normal level, right before Gnasty Gnorc. Insomniac did a good job with the PlayStation hardware.\n\nSound:\nThe music in the game is phenomenal. I love it. It really gets me excited when I play, especially as Im charging with super speed throughout some parts of the game. It is very exhilarating and I love it.\n\nDifficulty:\n The game is rather easy, but not super easy. The secrets are well hidden, but not impossible to figure out. I feel that the difficulty was nicely balanced.\n\nReplay Value:\n One could probably 100% the entire game in less than 10 hours. It is a blast, but still short. There isn't much replay value because of the lack of story, but it is fun while it lasts.\n\nFinal Judgment:\nThis game is RECOMMENDED. It isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it is still a solid game that any platformer fan would enjoy. The camera needs some reworking, the boss battles need something to differentiate them, and the game needs to last. However, it is still great.\nFINAL SCORE= 8.75", "summary": "Dragons are Fun", "unixReviewTime": 1460332800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2013", "reviewerID": "A1SZBQZC4UUMSU", "asin": "B00000I1BQ", "style": {"Platform:": " PlayStation"}, "reviewerName": "Debra", "reviewText": "Great to deal with.

When it first came out in 1996, needless to say I was blown away by the 3D directional jumping. It was my first playstation game. Of course there were some issues that I had with the game but it was the first of its kind and it paved the way for improvements. Some reviews have said how the game is hard. I agree to a point. I started playing it when I was in 5th grade and I still have a copy today but at that time it was a new concept to grasp playing a game with 3D controls versus simpler 2D controls from the Nintendo or Sega. But after a while and many Bandicoots being eaten, crushed, boiled in acid, drowning, or falling into dark abysses I came out on top. There are some levels that are still difficult for me (Lights Out for example) but I relish in the challenge it brings.\n\nToo hard for young kids some people say? So was the original Mario Bros from 1985 at one point. Ignoring secret jumping techniques with turtle shells, lives were hard to come by and you definitely needed them for the later worlds. In Crash Bandicoot they practically give lives away because the levels are fairly challenging throughout the game. For example, Boulder Dash wiped out the 50 some lives I had accumulated the first time got to that level.\n\nI agree with other people about the way that you save in that it is kind of annoying but we take that for granted today anyway. In prior games, like Mario 1985, if you got a game over it was back to the beginning of the world you died in. In this game, it's back to the last level you were at before you saved. Maybe the creators were trying to make it a challenging game by doing it that way. In that I say they succeeded.\n\nFor a platform gamer, this game has a nice blend of 3D motion with 2D side scrolling in a colorful environment that was pretty good visually for the graphics at the time. It definitely took you to a different world. The music for the various levels was appropriate and entertaining. Come on, remember Hog Wild? Good times riding that boar! It had a very linear type of progression but it was not too unlike Super Mario World with the coin shaped levels on the overworld map. The bonus rounds were indeed difficult but you could always replay them, minus the saving bonuses once you saved, and never lose lives in the bonus rounds. Aku aku was there in my time of need, especially when toxic barrels were bouncing my way. He is a different but unique take on the power ring or mushroom, flower, star buffs from the other iconic heroes. I am not saying Crash Bandicoot is better than other platform games before him, but he is unique and has his own style that improved in the titles that came after.

This allows you to save at anytime, so you're not going to have to get off (becuase your parents said so, of course) without saving all your hard and handy work and having to have to do it all over again.\n\n2nd Best Improvement: You have 5 levels to choose from at anytime.

Crash gets to drive some neato vehicles, including my favorite, the jet pack.\n\n5th Best Improvement: Greater and better bosses, (including N.

I'm lovin' the new addition of characters, including Coco Bandicoot, Crash's sister (whom I think should've been in the 1st game).\n\n8th Best Improvement: It's easier to collect gems, and there's a new addition, crystals.\n\nWorst Flaw: Well, it would be nice if Tawna hadn't suddenly disappeared.  I think she should've been crucial to the entrtie series, not just the 1st game.\n\n2nd Worst Flaw: You can't revisit bosses without a secret code.

You may have to do the newer level again, which tends to be a flaw.\n\nDespite this, I highly recommend this for fans of previous platforming games like Donkey Kong Country and Sonic the Hedgehog.

This game is tough. It's an excellent platformer, one of the all time best for that matter, but some of the levels are rage inducing.\n\nCrash is the perfect mascot/icon for Sony and they let him go. At the time when Sony needed one, Crash was there and sold systems. He was the face of Playstation and it's baffling why they didn't hang on to him. Just ask Nintendo or Sega what the advantages of a mascot are. Nintendo is dead without Mario and after many failed attempts, Sega is still trying to resurrect Sonic. Crash was perfect for Sony. He's funny, has attitude, likable and recognizable and the games we're the first, really good 3D platformers for the next generation. He also provided a stable franchise for the younger audience, which every company knows they want and need. What happened here? Man, I remember the commercials when a guy in a Crash outfit went to Nintendo headquarters and stood outside with a bullhorn and was taunting Mario, daring him to come out. Classic. That was Crash. Sony really dropped the ball here.\n\nCrash has never been the same since Naughty Dog let him get away. Other developers have made some very uninspired sequels with him, changing his looks, alliances and even voice. I know you can't do the same thing forever but none have come close to the success of Naughty Dog, when they held the reins of this franchise. Today, Crash sits in a woeful state, being made to participate in very un-Crash-like games.\n\nThis game started it all though. This changed the platformer forever. While Mario and Sonic we're still going left to right in their side scrolling adventures, Crash took us into his world with glorious 3D. It said something about the future of games and consoles at the same time and it was only on Playstation. Even today, this is a very challenging platformer. Amidst the Ratchet's, Jak's, Sly's and 3D Mario's and Sonic's, the original Crash is about as tough as there is. But it's also compelling enough to want to keep going. You never don't know how your going to get through the level (they're linear afterall), it's getting the right timing and touch to do what needs to be done. There are some truly insane levels here that will test all your patience and nerve. But you'll just want to keep trying, at least till you get to your next save point so you know you don't have to do the level again that you just did. Fortunately, there's plenty of fruit and extra lives, but your gonna need them all.\n\nThe audio, video, and play mechanics in the original Crash trilogy are spot on. These games still look, sound and play great today. They're a very few of the only original PSone games I can bare to look at, let alone play anymore. The look is perfect with bright colors and varied enviornments and the music and sounds are catchy and perfect for each stage. These games have aged extremely well and are a real tribute to the developers at Naughty Dog.\n\nThere are a couple of downsides though. These games are really tough, maybe too tough for the average gamer or especially child. Some of this is intentional design and some I feel maybe the fact that 3D platforming was in it's infancy at this time. Some of the angles on jumps, just seem a little off. The perspective can make it really tricky. Another problem is that the save points can be a little far between. Not the check points during the levels, they are plentiful and life saving, but the save points. Sometimes, I just wanted to finish a level I'd been on for a while, save and quit. But then I'd find that I had to go through another whole level and a half, just to get the bonus round/save point. And even the bonus round was tricky sometimes as it's set up as a mini level requiring you to get from one side to the other but if you fell along the way, you'd have to restart the level to get back to it. Again, more challenge and patience testing. My final complaint is that sometimes you'd have a nice number of lives you've accumulated from previous levels, say 20 or so, you save, come back and you only start with 4!!! I want my lives, I earned them!!! On a final note, I downloaded Crash on my PS3 but cant save as it wont, even though PS2 games do, so I have to use passwords. It's a little annoying but if they didn't provide them, then I'd really never be able to save.\n\nFor anyone new to Crash, looking to try it out, don't let any of this put you off. These (the first 3) are fantastic games overall. They're among the tip top in the platforming genre and are some of the most challenging but rewarding at the same time. Crash is truly a gaming icon and I hope some way, somehow, that his original developers can one day give him and us another grand adventure worthy of the name Crash Bandicoot.", "summary": "Crash Bandicoot, a Game or a Torture Device?", "unixReviewTime": 1209254400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2007", "reviewerID": "A1QT6PHXDA5XDF", "asin": "B00000I1BQ", "style": {"Platform:": " PlayStation"}, "reviewerName": "Bob_E", "reviewText": "This item was purchased as a gift for my Grandson, it was requested by him and his mother, they both love the game.

It was new, it was innovative.  It had something.  Meanwhile, the Sony Playstation got Crash Bandicoot, and this was described as a game that could take Mario on at his own game.  That, of course, didn't happen, as Mario still holds the torch.  However, Crash Bandicoot wasn't a bad game.  It was, however, a bit more flawed than most other games out there for certain reasons, the main one seeming to be its unforgiving difficulty.  There were, of course, other mitigating factors.\n\nCrash Bandicoot carries the--even then--overdone save the damsel in distress storyline, ala Mario saving Princess Peach over and over.  Much like Mario, however, Crash wasn't about storyline.  It was about gameplay, and here it's just as simplistic as it is in your average 2D side-scroller.  Crash only has two attacks.  His spinning attack and a jump attack.  You'll use this to take down your enemies.  There are advantages to using one attack over the other.  For example, the spinning attack can potentially send enemies flying into other enemies while the jump attack gives Crash some extra air, which is actually needed to access some of the games little secrets.\n\nThroughout each level, Crash also has the ability to obtain Aki-Aki.  A mask that serves to protect Crash.  If you have one you can sustain two hits before you die.  If you have two you can sustain three hits.  If you have three you'll be temporarily invincible.  The game also makes it a point to give you an Aki-Aki if you're dying too many times in a certain level, and believe me, that'll happen a lot.  The good news is that Crash Bandicoot isn't shy about giving you extra lives.  The bad news is that you'll still mow through a lot of them pretty quickly.  A lot of the times things are just unfair.  The camera is permanently fixed behind Crash, so sometimes it's hard to predict jumps, or sometimes even where some enemies are.  Also, the amount of surprises they throw at you can be annoying as well.  Like a bridge where the planks fall out and then you get to what is seemingly a dead end only to find out that you've no time to look because the plank your standing on is also lose.  Thus, you've no choice but to go through a lot of trial and error in levels.\n\nTo its credit, though, Crash Bandicoot has a variety of levels.  There's the basic 3D platforming where you basically run through the level in a straight line with the camera behind you, but there are some levels that make you go about the old fashioned way by these levels being 2D side-scrollers.  There are also levels where you'll run from a boulder in Indiana Jones style, levels where you'll ride on a hog.  You'll get your fill from these levels.  Although, many level designs are also very simplistic and straightforward.  There's not a whole lot of exploration to be done, and even when you can veer off course, you'll only be backtracking to get back on the right course.  In short, many levels are just too linear.\n\nMastering the game is also fairly difficult.  Throughout each level there are crates that you have to smash.  If you smash all the crates, you score a perfect.  Seems simple right?  Well, the catch is you have to smash every crate in the level without dying.  And again, with some unfair camera angles in some levels, and the trial and error, you'll be attempting to score a perfect on a level several times.  Likewise, it seems strange that the levels are so difficult yet the games bosses are so easily taken down--including the final boss Dr. Neo Cortex.  Most boss battles aren't a challenge, but getting to them sure as hell is.\n\nEven the games save system is flawed.  As you go through each and every level you'll find tokens that'll let you catch a glimpse of the girl Crash is out to save in this game.  The problem is this token is hidden in crates throughout the level.  The second problem is that you need three of them.  The THIRD problem is that you have to go through some stupid mini-level in order for your game to actually be saved.  They're played out in a 2D side-scroller like fashion with the exception that even in these levels there are some 3D elements, which again require trial and error to get through sometimes.  At least you don't lose a life... just the chance to save your game.  The FOURTH problem with this is that once you collect all three tokens, whether you were able to make it through the bonus round and save your game or not, you can't get them again.  Thus in each level you're only given the chance to save once, and you may not even get it!  This is inexcusable.  The later installments of the series certainly did a better job with the save feature.  There's also a password system here for those who don't have a memory card, and that's really nice to have.  Again, however, it sucks that you only really get one chance to save.  You can save after scoring a perfect on a level, but again, that's a one time deal.  You can't go to an easy level, score a perfect and save again.\n\nDespite its gameplay issues, Crash Bandicoot looked good at least.  Especially for a game released in 1996.  It runs fairly smoothly, and just looks great for the time of its release.  It wasn't a launch title, but at least it was a game that was easy on the eyes.  The levels also look good and even too this day the game still has a particular visual charm to it.  It can't hold a candle up to today's graphics but in 1996 this was a charmer.  The game also didn't sound so bad either.  Some tunes do get annoying, but a lot of tunes really satisfy the levels, and the sound effects are brilliant.  As far as presentation goes, Crash Bandicoot really knew how to hand it to us.\n\nUnfortunately, it's unforgiving difficulty may actually be enough to turn some fans away after a while.  Was it a good game?  Sure it was.  But the first installment just had a lot of unforgiving issues that thankfully were worked out in the second game.  It's not bad for a first outing, but a game shouldn't be so unforgiving in its difficulty.\n\nPros:\n\n+It's a good looking game\n\n+It sounds good\n\n+Simple gameplay that anyone can pick up and learn\n\n+A variety of levels\n\n+Tons of secrets and little things to do; you'll be busy just trying to complete the game 100%\n\nCons:\n\n-The difficulty level of this game is unforgiving\n\n-Bad camera angles\n\n-The games levels are difficult yet the games bosses are disturbingly easy\n\n-A lot of trial and error moments\n\n-Many levels are too linear\n\n-The save system set up is absolutely horrible\n\nIt's still a good game, but later games in the series do a far better job.", "summary": "Crash's First Outing is Flawed", "unixReviewTime": 1176681600}, {"overall": 3.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2007", "reviewerID": "A2ZDEIO803CM2L", "asin": "B00000I1BQ", "style": {"Platform:": " PlayStation"}, "reviewerName": "Movie Lover", "reviewText": "This game was fun and all but it was hard as heck.

That's what Sony thought would happen back in the day.  After all, they promoted the game to death.  Well look at that... didn't happen!  And with good reason.  The game is horrible.  I can't believe ANYONE would prefer this junk over Sonic the Hedgehog or, especially, the Mario Bros. series.\n\nYou have to give Sony a LOT of credit for all the attention they put into Crash Bandicoot in an attempt to put the game on the same extraordinary level as Mario and Sonic, but gamers never really caught on to Crash the same way.  When you think about it, the Playstation already HAD a huge selection of games to choose from around the time Crash was released, therefore Sony didn't even NEED a mascot.  People were buying Playstation games like crazy anyway!  Crash Bandicoot never even had to exist.\n\nYou'd think for a debut game (a BIG debut, considering all the advertisements on TV commercials) Sony would have made the game a *little* easier for younger or inexperienced gamers to play.  Instead, Sony started off the Crash series with impossible bonus levels (impossible to complete AND find- I didn't even KNOW the game had bonus levels until I looked it up in the instruction booklet!)\n\nEven if you ignore the bonus levels, the challenge overall is pretty high anyway thanks to all the difficult stages (such as the one where you're crossing a bridge way up in the sky and continue falling through the wooden cracks- a NIGHTMARE of a level!)  All the lives you earned up to this point in the game will go away.  A mascot debut game shouldn't have the difficulty THIS high because the idea is for players of ALL ages to enjoy the game.  Children will not like the nonstop frustration.\n\nI think the biggest reason Crash Bandicoot isn't remembered today the same way Mario and Sonic's debut games are is because Crash is basically just a blend of Mario and Sonic, but featured in a 3D world.  Think about it.  Crash collects berries throughout the game (Mario collects coins, Sonic collects rings).  Crash has a spin attack (Mario and Sonic already had spin attacks YEARS before Crash's existence).  Sony just didn't have enough creative ideas to come up with something entirely different, and that's why most gamers tend to ignore Crash Bandicoot.  When you already have the best (Mario and Sonic) you don't need imitations.\n\nCrash Bandicoot may have improved later on (not enough of an improvement to earn its mascot reputation, however) but the series certainly did NOT start with a bang.  I will always remember the very first Crash Bandicoot game as being this uninteresting, frustrating experience.  Heck, just the fact that only 62 reviewers have submitted reviews for the game right here on amazon goes to show Crash Bandicoot's first adventure was meant to be gone and forgotten.  Add to the fact that right now in the year 2006 NO ONE is talking about ANY Crash Bandicoot game anymore.

I'm looking forward to his latest video game installment, Crash Tag Team Racing.  The game's graphics are good, the gameplay itself sounds amuzing, and the trailer (on GameSpot) prove how visually stunning it's going to be too.  But, Crash's humble beginning is not the same as Mario and Sonic's were.  It was much better, more creative, and bigger.\n\nMario's was just an arcade game.  It was hard, but it didn't take to long to master it, and I don't even know if there was a boss.  Sonic's debut was better then Mario's.  A game you could play without spending money, good levels, challenging, better bosses, and a special ending you could view if you collected all the items necessary.  But, these debuts lacked what Crash's had.  Most challenging, best bosses, better secret ending, and most of all, a 3-D world to play in.\n\nCrash's world is not fully 3-D in this game (in fact up till Crash Twinsanity, none of them have been), but it is very good as far as it goes.  The VIRTUAL world looks like the REAL world.  That's one of the game's strongest points.  The controls are very solid and Crash responds amazingly well to your commands.  This spoiled me.  I'd play a Crash game and then go play something else with looser controls and be upset by the lack of response.  I became versatile after a while though.  Crash lacks moves in this game, but he has more then Sonic and/or Mario had in their debut games.  Crash has 3, Mario and Soinc only had 1.  Crash's moves are running, jumping, and spinning.  The spinnig move is an extremely creative thing.  To make up for Sonic's spin, Naughty Dog brought out the bigger and better guns.  Crash's spin is much easier to control and is much more effective.  It also doesn't threaten you in a strange, almost indescribable way.  Sonic's spin reqired that you dash in the direction that you were facing before you started spinning.  Sega called this the spin dash.  This could throw you to your death.  Not Crash's.  Crash could move or stay still when spinning.  Note: Soinc didn't have the spin dash in his debut game.  Mario and Sonic's jumping, I'll admit, was better.  They were tighter then Crash.  Their direction could be changed much, much easier then Crash when jumping.  Crash jumps higher though.  Crash runs kind of slow, especially when you need to get something done. But he's slower in Crash Twinsanity.  Crash's camera control is hardly ever a problem.  Every once in a while you'll have to strain your eye a little, but it's still a better camera then Soinc's.  Mario's is best out of all, though, 'cause you could see the entire level all at once.\n\nAs for the other features of the game, they're pretty outstanding.  The levels are big and challenging.  There's also secret levels in Crash.  I've never seen anything like that in Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong, have you?  No, I didn't think so.  Crash's biggest flaw is the saving system.  In the game, you must collect 3 tokens of Crash's girfriend's head (hidden in the level) to get to a bonus area.  You must get to the end of the Tawna (Crash's girlfriend's name is Tawna) Bonus Round, touch Tawna (who's just standing there), and then exit the Tawna Bonus Round via a warp pad in order to save.  If you don't do exactly what I said had to be done in order to save, you don't get to save. Not fair at all.  But, it's still better then Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong, 'cause you can't save at all in those games.  There are also two other kinds of bonus rounds in the game, The Cortex (main bad guy of the game) Bonus Rounds and the Brio (Cortex's right-hand man) Bonus Rounds.  You can't save in these bonus rounds, even if you get to the end of them without falling off the platforms.  Oh and get this, there aren't Tawna Bonus Rounds in all the levels, so you don't have a chance to save if your parents tell you to get off and you're in a level like Hog Wild where there's no bonus rounds.  Big flaw.  The 2nd biggest flaw is the way you have to collect gems.  In the game you must collect 32 (I think; don't quote me on that number, because I'm not sure) gems in order to see the secret ending.  However, it's a little too hard to collect them all.  I understand most people think the game's not hard enough, but I think it's a little too hard.  To collect a gem, you must destroy every single crate in a level and get to the end without losing a life.  I'm all for destroying every crate, but I think you should be able to lose a life and still get the gem.  It should only matter if you destroy all the boxes.\n\nSo, if you're wanting to compare Mario and Sonic to Crash, I'd say Crash all the way.  And, as you can see, if you're reading this, Crash's 1st game was much better then Mario and Sonic's.

It was, in fact, so delightful that I looked around for the first part to start from the proper point.\nWhen I started playing the first part, I was disappointed by the difference of the story, but, still, It was a nice game.\nThe graphics are excellent. The story is original. It speaks about a genetically engineered dog, named Crash, that resembles human beings. This genetic procedure was done by Dr Cortex (or more precisely by his degraded assistant). Then Dr Cortex goes on the produce a new female version of this Crash. Of course crash falls in love with her. Dr Cortex, being a wicked soul, parts between the two and then Crash needs to go through so many obstacles to reach his lover.\nSo many levels are divided into islands, and each set of levels is followed by a bad boss. Some are hard and some are easy. It depends in your skill in such games. The story is concluded by a battle between this Crash and Dr Cortex. If you win then you got it.\nAnd to complicate life even more, the designers introduced the concept of gaining gems. If you get all the gems you can continue the game in a new fashion. I aint saying it 'cause I don't want to spoil things for you. To attain these gems is a difficult task. As for me, I got them but after being kicked in the teeth for it. You should not even dream of getting the gems in order of levels. No, mon ami, some times you have to go to a certain advanced level to get a \"green gem,\" for instance, to get the gem in the, say, fourth level. You would have to check the net for the tricks, dirty if I may, and the hidden places. Good luck in that.\nThere is \"aku-aku,\" which is a mask that is considered as an extra life if you get touched by any of the enemies. Take 3 aku-akus and you become invincible for some seconds and you kill any of the enemies by a mere touch.\nOf course, there are saving stations. You do not get to save after every level. This is a drawback. Saving stations are also level you have to jump, crush, step on dynamite, and so on. If you fall down, you cannot save, you have to go to the next saving station. It is hare, I am telling you.\nThe game is great, and if you win with a 100 per-cent then you are the man!\nCrash 2 (5 Stars):\nThe Best Game Ever:\nThis game has everything the first part lacked. It has even better graphics. This was the first one of the crash series I tried, and it was fun. Before that, I was hooked on fighting games, like street fighters, and tekken, but they are not that fun after playing it a 100 times or so. In this game you can spend as much time without losing interest.\nIt is, more or less, like the first part. There is aku-aku, boxes to crash, gems (more difficult), new bosses after each floor. And by the by, this game is divided into 5 floors, each floor with 5 doors, each door with a different adventure. You can finish the game, like I did the first time, without collecting gems, but it is not that fun. Hint: If you break all the boxes of one level you are rewarded a gem. There are hidden levels for some gems, you would have to consult the internet for it. Good luck in that.\nIn this part you can save after each level, it is easier in that respect. I find the gems easier to collect than in the first forbidding game. The designs of the adventure is by far better than the firs.\nThe story line is change a little bit. Instead of the \"Pamela Anderson\" of a lover Crash had, he gets a more geeky \"Meg Ryan\" of a sister. Dr Cortex is still missing things up. The assistant from the first part does not appear except when he tries to communicate Crash to warn him from Cortex. You want to know more? Get the gems first.\nThere is also a sixth hidden floor. You would have to reach it by a trick, and again check the net for that.\nThe game was the best I have ever tried. It makes my life harder, since I cannot find better games to play anymore.

The demo disc that came with my PlayStation back in 1997 had a demo of the game and by all accounts I was pretty taken with. The graphics were bright and colorful, the world it presented (and by extension Croc and the Gobbos) were cute and likable and overall it seemed to be a pretty solid 3D platformer. Developed by Argonaut Software who developed the Super FX technology used in Nintendo's Star Fox on the SNES in the early 1990's, I ordered a copy of the game based on those memories... but fifteen years is a long time to be away from any game and with advancements in gaming this leaves little room for error. Unfortunately, if the title of this review is any indication, Croc pretty much squanders most of the good will its positives bring to the table and only serves as a history lesson as to why the series never saw daylight after the 32-bit generation.\n\nAlmost all of Croc's problems center on the controls. Well, it's not completely on the controls, rather it's a combination of the controls AND a camera that does whatever it wants - but if it wasn't for this I firmly believe more people would remember it. The game's controls are not unlike those in Core Design/Edios' Tomb Raider series - which in today's world some people find rather archaic - but I'm still at home with them since I grew up with that game. What makes Croc different (and ultimately more problematic) is the camera is not completely locked behind Croc at every moment. This makes certain moments of the game painful to play and its because these controls are more befitting of a game like Tomb Raider where the game world is more technical being built on a grid of squares. This isn't the case with Croc.\n\nWell, that's kind of a lie because the further you get in the Legend of Gobbos the more technical (and challenging) the levels are with all their little platforms and obstacles where the clunky controls become a real liability. Even worse are the controls when Croc is underwater or doing a mini-game as these sections are simply horrendous. The situation with the controls is a real shame since the game (aside from the utterly pathetic boss battles) would still be astounding today if it wasn't for them. It's (kind) of possible to enjoy Croc despite its problems but I personally had to play the game in small bite-sized portions to really avoid my building frustrations - a red flag for a gamer if there ever was one.\n\nDespite Croc's shortcomings I can't really tell people to flat-out avoid the game. I still have a soft spot for it (and the characters) despite what I experienced while playing through it. Still, if you can I'd recommend trying - or revisting - the game before you buy it. For those that played Croc when it originally came out nostalgia might be enough to save it, but those without an attachment to the IP will quickly see the game as the ailing entity it is.", "summary": "Would be a PS1 classic if it wasn't for the controls...", "unixReviewTime": 1386288000}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "09 27, 2013", "reviewerID": "A1F23MY8SB905X", "asin": "B00000I1BS", "reviewerName": "Mitch", "reviewText": "I played Croc 2 more often, but I did play Croc: Legend of the Gobbos when I was young.

Your goal throughout the game is to unfreeze all the dragons, and collect stolen dragon eggs from the taunting blue thieves. Each of the six homeworlds contains a non-mandatory boss battle (aside from the Gnorc Gnexus) and a balloonist who will transport you to the next homeworld. Your health meter is represented by a little dragonfly by the name of Sparx that follows you around. Sparx starts out bright yellow, dulls to blue, then to green, and once he is gone, you're toast.

It was a simplistic game that was absolutely gorgeous to look at.  Obviously inspired by Crash Bandicoot and Super Mario 64, Croc was a game that could've been for everyone.  However, lackluster controls and a bad camera make Croc more frustrating than fun.\n\nAs with most games aimed at the younger audience, Croc has a simple story.  The Gobbos have been kidnapped by an evil Baron.  It's up to Croc to save the Gobbos and stop the Baron.  And he'll traverse four worlds to do it.\n\nThe level layout of Croc is surprisingly good.  Levels are pretty straightforward but you'll be able to veer off path whenever you need to.  In every level your goal is to get to the end and ring the gong.  Along the way Croc will be faced with enemies and natural traps like lava or freezing waters.  In every level you'll also collect gems.  From level to level the total gems you finish with stack up on each other.  For every 100 gems you'll get an extra life, and you'll need those lives.  There are also six Gobbos in every level you venture to.  Five of them are scattered throughout the level randomly.  However, the last Gobbo requires you to find five special gems and open a special door at the end of a level.  Upon finding those gems and opening a special door, the game will usually make you play some kind of bonus game or solve a puzzle to get the last Gobbo.  Some of these parts of the game are incredibly frustrating.  For example, in one bonus game you'll have to make Croc jump on buttons in order to \"whack\" sheep in a sort of Whack the Mole fashion.  However, it speeds up and the controls aren't all that friendly.\n\nThat may very well be the biggest problem with Croc.  The game is such a pain to control.  You'll suffer a lot for this.  Up always moves Croc forward but the camera is always moving.  Croc doesn't turn sharp enough so you'll mostly spend time stopping and turning so that you can continue on your way.  This wouldn't be so bad if there weren't enemies on your tail or if you didn't have to stop and turn on a collapsing platform.  Even worse is the camera.  You don't get control over it at all.  The view doesn't shift fast enough which may lead to you running into an enemy simply because you don't know where it is, or having to quickly jump off a collapsing platform.  These issues make Croc--an already challenging game as it is--harder than it has to be.  It's frustrating as well.  The game has potential, and the right gameplay elements, but the controls make it too hard.  However, it is still a good challenge.  Completing the game 100% by finding all the Gobbos and getting the second ending is a task in and of itself.\n\nWhat Croc lacks in gameplay it certainly makes up for in everything else.  The game looks stunning.  Especially for a Playstation game in 1997.  The FMVs look incredible, the bosses look spectacular.  The environments look incredible as well.  There are hardly any Playstation games that look this smooth or run this well.  The soundtrack is also a beautiful soundtrack.  In terms of production values, Croc is an astonishing game to behold.\n\nIn short, Croc is a good game, but a game that would've been so much better if it didn't suffer from such horrible controls and a bad camera.  It's a fun game, but only barely so.

I despised thouse two games for what they had done to that cool, little dragon we use to know.\nBut, alas! At least I saved my original game for times like these!

Or, if you are new to the first original Spyro games, go out and buy them!

I can't give Spyro's first adventure a 5-star rating, though.  Let's get the problems out of the way before moving on to the positive things about Spyro (and believe me, there's a LOT of good things about this game).\n\nPeople have compared Spyro the Dragon to everything from Crash Bandicoot to Banjo-Kazooie to Nights, and... who knows what else.  Well, I think the first Spyro game is JUST as good as all those games.  In fact, Spyro the Dragon is better than the first Crash Bandicoot game.  Now THERE'S a game that disappointed me.  Spyro came out of nowhere and RULED right from the beginning.  I never would have guessed back in 1998 that Spyro would have went on to become a classic.\n\nSpyro's debut does have a few problems, though.  Seeing as how this is Spyro's very first adventure I won't be TOO harsh.  Am I the only one who thinks the play control could have been better?  It's not that I have a tough time controlling Spyro.  Well, to be honest, I DID have trouble controlling him at first.  Spyro doesn't QUITE take off when you hit up, down, left or right on the directional pad.  There's a split second delay before moving forward.  Maybe the creators of the game thought this was part of the realism since, after all, you're moving a DRAGON.  A BIG creature like a dragon won't move forward right away.  Then again, Spyro is small compared to the dragons you have to rescue.\n\nControlling Spyro was definitely a problem for me at first.  For example, attempting to properly jump on top of the three round platforms you encounter at the very beginning of the first world was NOT an easy task.  I kept sliding off.  By the way, I recommend you take advantage of these round platforms to get to know the controller.  Master the controller before exploring the world.  This will cut down on any possible frustration you may encounter in the future.\n\nI have to consider that my inability to control Spyro may have been due to the camera angles.  Even though the camera in this game is *drastically* better than many other games, you have to admit it isn't flawless either.  If you hit Pause and go to the options, you will see an option for a second camera view called \"active\".  This view is better because the camera immediately follows behind Spyro at ALL times.  The other (default) camera view is more of a hassle trying to figure out where you're moving, and you can't get a good view of what lies ahead.  You may want to change it to \"active\" if the other camera view is difficult for you.  Thank goodness for this option!\n\nSome people have a problem with the lack of challenge.  While it's completely true you won't have much trouble making it to the end of any stage in the game, prepare to die 4 or 5 times in each stage before you understand exactly what you have to do, and where you have to jump.  I think the most challenging thing about Spyro the Dragon are the times you have to jump onto a far-away platform, and many times you just BARELY make it.  Many times you will fall to your death.  Be patient, though.  The game NEVER messes with you by throwing in any impossible jumps.  Sometimes it's about finding *just* the right spot to jump and glide, and if you're off just a *little bit* you won't make it.  The creators of Spyro are smart not to make the game frustrating, seeing as how it's supposed to be a game for the entire family.  Good work.\n\nThe biggest challenge comes at the very end of the game when you face the main boss.  He's really easy to beat, however, GETTING to him is a whole other story.  You see, right at the very end before you face him, you have to jump over a series of disappearing platforms and if you fall (and you WILL fall the first few times because it's hard) you will land in burning lava and have to do the whole stage over again.  Not that the stage is really that long anyway, but this is by FAR the hardest part of the game.  The other 99% of the game only offers a slight challenge here and there.\n\nWith that said, don't be fooled into thinking the game will be a cakewalk because of all the easy obstacles found throughout World One.  It DOES get harder.  You see, many of the enemies you face in the later levels can only be defeated by either smacking them with your head, or shooting fire at them.  You won't know which of these tricks will be most effective on them until you face the enemy and experiment.  You also have to dodge fireballs, sword-swipes, dogs jumping at you, and tons of other enemy attacks WHILE you try to find the best way to defeat them.  So it's not pathetically easy after all.\n\nA minor complaint is that sometimes while you're walking or running, the path will suddenly end, and you'll fall to your death.  Doesn't happen often, but I thought it would be worth mentioning.\n\nI hate the way Spyro talks.  He sounds like a bratty teenage rebel with a nasally voice.  Not exactly what a dragons voice should sound like.  Also, when you rescue the dragons, sometimes they say important things you might want to pay attention to.  The problem here is that many times the important tips they say aren't really helpful because they say them right AFTER you've already had to do them!  For instance, in one case after you glide to a far-away platform and rescue a dragon, the dragon will tell you how to glide.  Obviously, since I needed to glide in order to rescue him, I already KNOW how to glide!  So I didn't NEED his help!  This happens a few times during the game.  You just want to scream \"Thanks for nothing, bonehead!\"\n\nThe music was done by a member of the rock band the Police, Stewart Copeland.  People may not realize it, but certain themes in Spyro the Dragon are *very* close to some of the songs that made the Police such a legendary rock band.  Stewart Copeland may have intentionally created the music in this game to match that of the Police, specifically the songs \"walking on the moon\" and \"message in a bottle\".  You'll soon realize that the same guy who created the music in this game also played a big part in creating those Police songs.  The music in Spyro the Dragon is also very catchy and appropriate for the level you're in.  No complaints.  The music is fantastic.\n\nI think the creators made a mistake.  When you hit L2 the camera rotates clockwise, and R2 makes the camera rotate counter-clockwise.  It should be the other way around.  Another thing that needs reversed: the way Spyro flies in the bonus stages.  When you press up, you fly down.  When you press down, you fly up!  Strange mistake.  This makes it harder to complete the flying stages, however, you don't have to finish them.\n\nIn fact, despite what people may tell you, you do *not* have to collect ALL the gems and ALL the dragons.  Finding and collecting all the gems and dragons will only give you a better percentage and open up a bonus stage at the end of the game.  The gameplay in Spyro the Dragon can actually be compared to Yoshi's Island- you don't have to find everything, but doing so will open up rewards and give you an overall better score.  The creators did a fantastic job hiding gems and dragons, increasing the challenge.  More often than not you will see a treasure chest or a dragon statue up high on a platform and not have a single clue how to reach it.  It's fun to run around and think about how to reach it.  Some of them are cleverly located.  One word to describe it- *awesome*\n\nAnyway, Spyro the Dragon is tons of fun and may possibly remind you of a 3D Donkey Kong Country, what with TNT barrels and the jungle levels you encounter later on.

Very well made.  You play Spyro(DUH), a young dragon.  All the other dragons(I think there are 60 or so of them),  have been captured and turned to stone,  and are scattered about in the different worlds.  The Dragon Eggs have been stolen by theives who are running around and hiding in different worlds.  The dragon's treasure is lying around everywhere(not to mention alot of it has been turned into enemies).  And who is the cause of this?  GNASTY GNORC.  And now, as Spyro, you must save the dragons,  find the eggs, collect the treasure and defeat Gnasty Gnorc.  Ok,  that's the plot basicall; now here is what the game is like:  As Spyro, your mission is to(As I said before) save the dragons, find the tresure and rescue the eggs.  Being a young dragon,  your wings are not fully grown,  so you can not fly.  You can, however, glide over short distances.  You also have the ability to(Of course)breathe fire and charge with your horns.  There are several worlds throughout the game.  Each of these worlds has one home level, and in each of the home levels, there are doorway/portholes through which lie other levels for the worlds.  In each of the worlds there will be dragons, treasure and eggs.\nDragons:  These have been turned to stone by Gnasty Gnorc.  To save them you simply find them, then walk up to them or charge at them or Flame them.  They will then come back to life and talk to you before flying away.  Some will give you advice,  others will thank you, and some will just talk (sometimes insulting you).\nTreasure:  Treusure is just lying around in different places.  Most of the enemies turn into treasure(which looks like gem stones).  Some treasure are in chests.  Most chests can be rammed or flamed to open them, but some requre dynamite or fire works or other ways to open them.\nEggs: These are held by theives.  To get them,  you must chase after the theif and ram or flame him.\nEnemies: There is a large variety of enemies (most enemies are really treasure that have been turned into minions for Gnasty Gnorc).  Most can be killed by ramming or flaming,  though some are armored and can only be hurt by flaming and not by ramming or visa versa.  Some boss enemies, however, require special battle tactics.\n  There are also fairies who will help you in some way.  Some will catch you if your falling, and will move you to safety,  while others will give you a Super Strong fire breath(which will allow you to flame armored enemies).  Hovering above Spyro is a dragonfly.  The color of the dragon fly shows you your current health. Green, if your have full health, and red if you are very hurt.  He will disappear if you get hurt when he is red.  In each home world there are guys with hot air ballons.  These ballooners tell you what you must do in that world for them to take you to the next world (you can always return to past worlds later to pck up anything you might have missed).  In most worlds you usually have to find a certain number of dragons, treasure or eggs.  Finally, you will get to Gnasty's world, where you will have to fight Gnasty Gnorc.\n  Well, that's \"Spyro the Dragon\".  I recommend this game to anyone who has Playstation.

I am 13 years old, and I got this when I was 12. The levels of the first world, Artisans, are super easy with a very easy boss. It's harder to GET TO the boss than it is to beat it. The levels just seem to keep getting just a tad bit harder, but nothing significant. The hardest boss is the boss of the second level and he isn't very hard either. Gnasty Gnorc is a surprisingly easy boss, once you figure out how to toast him. What makes this game annoying is that there is so much treasure, spread out into so many different places, that you will just rip your hair out in some of the levels trying to get it. But there are some pros. This game is a little bit long making for long lasting entertainment. The game also has great graphics with a frame rate that never slows down, and because between screens, the game is counting treasure, so it's like there's never a single load time. Also, some of the enemies are pretty funny, like in one level, if you do the right thing at the right time, the enemy will actually MOON you, and it's hilarious to see. Also, the controls are simple enough for anyone to figure out making for not much trouble otherwise. Some points of the game are hard like recovering stolen eggs from the theives, but besides that, this is an easy game that I would recommend to anyone below teenage age. The only reason I gave this game three stars was because I know most people like a good challenge, but it wouldn't be fair to give it four just because I personally like an easy game.

I don't rate games or movies based on nostalgia, because let's be honest: some things just don't age well in the test of time and lose their effect that may have been once powerful in one's childhood. However, I must say: this still stands out as the best zombie horror game ever made. Best survival horror game ever made? That could be debatable with other strong contenders such as Silent Hill 2 and Dead Space 1. However, as far as zombie/mutated creatures games go, this stands on top. It has numerous jump scares and a great creepy atmosphere that leaves you tense while exploring the abandoned Raccoon City police department.\n\nResident Evil 2 introduces Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield, who would go on to star in future hit installments Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil Code: Veronica (respectively speaking). Leon is a rookie cop in Raccoon City and meets up with Claire during an infestation of zombies and other monsters in the small town that is on the brink of destruction. Together, they must get out and survive while Claire is focusing on finding her brother, Chris Redfield. It's a simple plot, simple premise. The gameplay might feel stiff to those accustomed to the control scheme of games such as Resident Evil 4 and 5, but trust me: if you give it time, you will find it fun and rewarding after a short while.\n\nPersonally, I prefer this game over RE4 or RE5 any day. The horror element is strong in this title, not action-oriented like those other two games. The storyline and characters are excellent and well-done. For Leon's storyline, we see interaction and character development between him and the mysterious Ada Wong; for Claire, it's between her and the lost girl Sherry Birkin. The voice acting and writing for these characters are all done so well, which makes the game ahead of its time as corny voice acting was prevalent in most video games when this was released.\n\nResident Evil 2 offers a lot of replay value. There are hidden items and other goodies you may not see during your first run, and I highly recommend trying both possible scenarios (Leon A/Claire B and Claire A/Leon B) for the game before moving onto other games in the series. There are also secret game modes and weapons to unlock in this game.\n\nOverall, there is a lot to do in terms of gameplay for Resident Evil 2 and it's one of the best video games ever made, hands down. If you've had the misfortune of never playing this game before, then don't waste any more time: play this, now! It's fun, it's scary and it's got great drama in its storyline.", "summary": "Greatest zombie horror game ever made", "unixReviewTime": 1407715200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2014", "reviewerID": "A2M92T0339AX7U", "asin": "B00000I1BJ", "reviewerName": "Franklin Gutierrez", "reviewText": "lol", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1404432000}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "2", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2014", "reviewerID": "A1NTDY413IHKUO", "asin": "B00000I1BJ", "reviewerName": "Amy Skye", "reviewText": "One of the best survival horror games of all time.

It takes place in Raccoon City which is the closest residence of the mansion from the first game. This time, the entire city has been transformed into zombies from the outbreak of the T-virus created by Umbrella. You get to play as two characters: Leon S. Kennedy (disc one) who is a Raccoon City Police Officer on his first day of the job and Claire Redfield (disc two) who came into town to search for her missing brother Chris Redfield who was one of the main characters in the first Resident Evil game. Both characters get their own set of weapons and storylines, but it doesnt matter what order you play them in.\n\nThe gameplay features the same basic principles as the first game. You have to solve puzzles, use a limited supply of ammunition, herbs to heal wounds, carry only eight items, and use typewriters to save. Its nice they stuck with the original format of the first game and I wish every Resident Evil game in the series was like this.\n\nYou get some new weapons such as a bowgun, sub machine gun, spark gun and upgrades to Leons handgun, shotgun and magnum. The aiming feels more comfortable and you always seem to be in control of where you shoot. One downside is that auto aim isn't set by default. When you start the game, you have to press Select to get to the options, select the controller settings and set the mode to Type C to turn the auto aim feature on. A nice new addition is that the characters current health can be determined by their posture and movement speed. This makes it easier to tell what condition your player is in and you don't have to go to the inventory screen to find out how much health you have like with the first game. The Item Boxes are back where you can store items you don't need and pick up later, but a new item you can retrieve is the Side Pack which will allow you to carry two more items increasing your total to ten. Both Leon and Claire are joined by a support partner throughout the story. Leon is aided by a woman named Ada Wong who is searching for her boyfriend. Claire is aided by a 12 year old girl named Sherry who was told to go to the police station because of the dangers in Raccoon City. But even the police station is infested with zombies and bio weapons. The enemies in this game are really memorable; there are the lickers who are just terrifying and powerful, especially later in the game. Then theres Mr. X who is like the Terminator, he always comes back to hunt you down.\n\nThe most innovative feature in this game is that there are different scenarios in this game. Say you play as Leon and complete the game as him; well you can then play as Claire in that same scenario to find out the true ending. And you cant play Claires second scenario by popping in the second disc for the first time to play as her, you have to unlock it first. So in total, there are four possible scenarios in this game.\n\nAnother innovative feature is that you get a ranking based on the total amount of time it took to complete a scenario, the number of saves and healing items you use. If you do well, you can unlock some goodies such as infinite ammo for a sub machine gun, gatling gun, rocket launcher, unlock special outfits and three new mini games. The first mini game, you play as Hunk, whose mission is to escape the Raccoon City Police Department with the latest G-Virus created by Umbrella. The second mode is known as Extreme Battle in which you play through the entire map of the game and you have to locate four special bombs to destroy the T-Virus in Umbrellas Lab before it can cause a lot of damage. You get to play as four characters: Leon, Claire, Ada and Claires brother Chris. Each has their own set of weapons and you can adjust a difficulty setting to fight stronger monsters including bosses from the regular game. The third and final game mode is called Tofu and it is the strangest mini game I have ever seen. You play as this giant block of Tofu (Yes, I am dead serious, a giant piece of Tofu) and in terms of the objective its the same as Hunks mission except you play as Tofu, who is only equipped with a combat knife, so it makes this mini game very difficult to complete. Ive completed the mode as Hunk, but never as Tofu. The good news however is that Tofu takes a lot of hits to kill so basically the only way to complete this game is to run. Dont even bother fighting the enemies, the knife in Resident Evil 2 is just extremely weak and isn't worth the time. Still this mode is worth playing just for the amusement factor because Tofu says some funny Japanese phrases whenever he gets hurt. Its funny, even though I cant understand it. It is also pretty difficult to unlock, you have to get an A ranking at least six times to play this mini game. For the Extreme Battle and Hunk, you only need two A rankings.\n\nOne thing I didn't mention yet is that the music is really awesome. It has orchestral themes and even opera themes and it fits the game very well. There were many different versions of this game. There was an updated version on PlayStation called Resident Evil 2: Dual Shock Edition which is the same as the regular game except it supports the PlayStations DualShock controllers analog stick and vibration function. The Extreme Battle Mode I mentioned is exclusive only to the Dual Shock Edition. Theres also a Rookie mode which gives the player a Machine Gun with infinite ammo at the start of the game, but you cant unlock the other mini games playing this difficulty even if you get an A ranking, you have to play Normal mode to unlock them. Another cool thing about the Dual Shock Version is you can use a cheat code to give yourself unlimited ammo. You just go to the control settings, hold R1 and press square repeatedly until the icon turns red. This version was later released on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation 3.\n\nThere were also ports on the PC and Dreamcast with slightly better graphics, higher frame rate and an art gallery. There was even a port on the Game com. It was a s***ty 2D black and white handheld console by Tiger. That port is just pathetic; Im not even going to discuss it. The best port however is the Nintendo 64 version. The sound on the Nintendo 64 version is better than the PlayStations version, it has updated graphics, new costumes, a setting to adjust the violence and blood color, a more responsive aiming control scheme, new files, cheat codes to give you infinite health and ammo and the most interesting feature of all is a randomizer to place items differently during each playthrough so it definitely has more variety. The only thing its missing is the Extreme Battle mini game. But this port is equally as good as the PlayStations version.\n\nAny criticisms I have with this game? Well its hard for me to think of things I don't like about this game, I guess a minor criticism is that you cant skip the in game cut scenes, you couldn't do that in the first game and its a minor annoyance when you already played the game a million times like I did and just want to get through the game. The problem most people have with this game is the beginning. You start the game surrounded by about ten zombies with a slow handgun. The first time playing, you only have a few seconds to figure out the controls until the zombies corner and kill you. It definitely sounds like a terrible idea to start next to the zombies. My strategy is to just run away. Hold square, press up on the d-pad to run and use up-left and up-right to get around the enemies. Once you figure that out, it isn't too hard to get past the zombies and give yourself some breathing room. It did take me a while to figure out the controls but Ive mastered it and you can too. The voice acting in this game is much better than the first Resident Evil, but still nothing too special. Thats about all the criticisms I can think of.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I used to play the s*** out of this game and in my opinion; this is undeniably not only the best Resident Evil game, but the best survival horror game and one of the best PlayStation games I have ever played. This game still manages to be very scary, if you're playing this for the first time, you are guaranteed to be so scared; your heart will burst out your chest. Trust me; I had my jumps even to this day. Its more fun playing this game alone in your room in the dark, with the volume turned up. This makes for a terrifying and memorable experience. I absolutely love this game, its just a masterpiece. Id recommend getting the version from the PlayStation Store to play on the PS3 for only $6, or the regular PlayStation version or the Nintendo 64 version. Those are the best options. The replay value is very high for me and I could play this game at any time. You will admire this game and its by far the best in the entire series.", "summary": "YOU HAVE RE-ENTERED THE WORLD OF SURVIVAL HORROR", "unixReviewTime": 1385856000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2013", "reviewerID": "A2PLD40CRNLN9E", "asin": "B00000I1BJ", "reviewerName": "chase", "reviewText": "I've been playing the series since I was about 10, the first game I played was the remake of the first and resident evil.

The virus that the evil Umbrella corporation has been researching managed to get out into the open, and people have been dropping dead like flies as a result. The story begins when two central characters are separated in a car crash, and both try to survive long enough to work out what on Earth is going on in Racoon City. It sounds like a very basic, even threadbare plot, and to tell the truth, it is. But therein lies the charm of Resident Evil and most all of its sequels. One can go anywhere, do anything, kill anything, and apart from the frustration of winding up with nowhere to go at times, the game will not penalise the player for it. In this day and age where racing simulators are nothing more than knowing which lever to jerk when, it makes for a nice change.\n\nOf course, as the main influence makes clear, the player soon finds themselves battling with undead citizens (and worse) throughout the course of the game. Those who like to kill everything in sight may find the going a little tough, as the game rewards the player for knowing what to kill and when. A zombie in a wide, open area does not require immediate shooting, but a licker in a confined space should be put down as quickly and quietly as possible. Knowing the difference can literally decide whether you complete this game or not. But if one does get into a situation where they are low on ammunition and are not sure where they are meant to go, they can simply keep exploring until a solution presents itself. Such is the quality of the artwork on offer that it takes a while for this to become boring.\n\nOne criticism of the game that is perfectly valid is that the zombie models only seem to have four varieties. Occasionally, different types will appear if certain conditions are met, such as not picking up any items during the trip to the police station, but for the most part, it is a rather generic bunch. Another problem is the save point system, which can make the quest seem repetitive at times if resumed. However, the fun of the game truly lies in revealing threads of the plot, which, while occasionally clich, is put together like an elegant series of Chinese boxes. Questions are raised constantly, and half the fun is in finding the answers. In a complete contrast to the second feature film, the motions and attacks of the enemy are completely consistent, and even make sense from a biological point of view. One other criticism I have that applies to all of the Resident Evil games I have played to date is that in so-called tense moments, when a mass-attack by zombies or other terrors begins, one can often tell when they have completely beaten off their opposition by when the background music calms down. Although I am not entirely sure that is a bad thing.\n\nThe replay value of the game is heightened by the ability to complete one character's quest, save the results, and use them on the other's. What one does in one game directly affects what happens in the other. Decisions such as who should take the submachine gun, for example, are of great importance in the game, as are such things as opening doors or killing certain major enemies. Getting into the underground lab towards the end of the game is quite a chilling moment, too. Notwithstanding the fight that takes place on the way down, this deserted research lab is enough to put the wind up any a dedicated viewer of horror films. A contrast, as it were, to the godawful second film adaptation.\n\nIf I were giving Resident Evil 2 a score, it would be ten out of ten. Sure, it is looking old considering it was originally released on the PlayStation and Dreamcast, but unlike the vast majority of games, it has the ability to withstand the test of time.

Well, a lot of people have said a lot of things about this game, so this is just my personal experience about this game.\n\nWhen Capcom announced Resident Evil 2 after the first one was a success, they announced it to be released in 1997, but 90% of the way through Capcom decided to scrap that project and start over (this would become normal for Capcom throughout the years of Resident Evil history), but what people saw at E3 was a totally different game. That version is called by the fans Resident Evil 1.5 and fans have been pleading with Capcom for it's release...\n\nWith Resident Evil 1.5, you had Leon, but you also had another character that was scrapped named Eliza Walker. Eliza was supposed to be a University student in Raccoon City, she loved motorcycles and she was eventually turned into Claire Redfield. The reason they scrapped this version is because it played too much like the original and they felt that they wanted to do something different since they felt that they had to surpass the original game.\n\nAlso, what I find interesting is that the first person you encounter in Leon's quest, Marvin, he was supposed to come with you in the scrapped version instead of turning into a zombie.\n\nAgain, sorry for the history lesson, so onto the review:\n\nIt was 1998, I was 14 years old and I was spending the night at a friend's house, and he said \"You wanna play Resident Evil 2?\" We popped in Leon's quest in and BAM! The rest is history.\n\nWhat made this game the best in the series? Well, it took what was good about the first game and multiplied it many times over adding two new characters to the Resident Evil Universe: Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie R.P.D. cop fresh out of the academy and is reporting for duty.\n\nClaire Redfield (who is Chris's younger sister from the first Resident Evil game) who comes to Raccoon City looking for her brother.\n\nEverything seems out of place at first, but once you see the zombies come after them, Leon and Claire get separated and now it is a MAD rush to the police station.\n\nOnce you get there (either as Leon or Claire), you start to unravel a story that is just completely amazing. If you play as Leon, you meet up with Ada who is looking for her boyfriend John and a newspaper reporter named Robert. As Claire, you met up with a little girl named Sherry, a scientist named Annette (who is Sherry's mother), and the police chief Brian Irons.\n\nAs you get deeper into the story as either character, you soon find out about the sub-characters and what their motives are; especially the seductive Ada. Ada, it turns out is looking for the G-Virus (which is the younger brother of the T-Virus, but also, much deadlier in making the zombies and monsters deadlier than they actually are), although she doesn't say who she works for until it is mentioned in Wesker's Report who Ada was working for; it turns out that she was working for Wesker. Toward the end in Leon's quest, she falls to her \"death\", but very much like Wesker, she keeps on coming back like a phoenix rising from the ashes (she comes back and help's Leon find the President's daughter in Resident Evil 4).\n\nAnnette (in Claire's quest) is actually trying to stop Ada from getting the G-Virus and makes the assumption that Claire is after her husband's work (William Birken is actually the father of the G-Virus, which after a raid he is shot and he injects the G-Virus into himself and basically becomes a menace for both characters).\n\nSherry get's infected with the G-Virus and Claire makes the only own cure for the virus...\n\nAlso in Claire's quest, Umbrella drops what looks like a bomb with legs in the police station and it turns out that they dropped another tyrant that bothers Claire through the game with the name Mr. X; putting Mr. X down only bought you time, nothing else. Most players decided not to play Claire's quest because of Mr. X...and yes I will admit that he could be a pain because very much like Nemesis in the third game, he came in the most uneasiest moments, except with this game, loading doors saved you...not so much in the third game.\n\nThere were new monsters in this game; like the big alligator in the sewers, the lickers, plant zombies that spat venom at you, and of course (unlike in the first game), you now have women zombies.\n\nAlso, what makes a RE game an RE game? Two words: Rocket Launcher. If you beat the game in under three hours, you can choose either a gatling gun or a rocket launcher with infinite ammo which gave you even more reason to mow the zombies down one last time.\n\nThere are also mini-games: The 4th Survivor which you took control of Hunk where you have to grab the G-Virus and make a mad dash to the end, and also Tofu Survivor which is pretty much like The 4th Survivor, except you only have a knife to fight the zombies, but also it also let us know that at least the developers have a sense of humor.\n\nWith a fresh story-line (at the time), new monsters, and just about everything that makes the early RE games good...If you haven't played it, it is worth checking it out.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis game has been ported to many systems, but it has never been remade. There are fans that would LOVE to see this game remade (myself included) with cleaner graphics, in HD, and a couple of tweaks; one of them being you can move in a 360 position with a weapon, and if you get trapped by a zombie, you can get out of the way before he/she starts to enjoy their manwich.\n\nHappy Gaming!", "summary": "Easily The Best In The Series...", "unixReviewTime": 1298160000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2011", "reviewerID": "A2II09GQGWOMTQ", "asin": "B00000I1BJ", "reviewerName": "Brian Nallick", "reviewText": "RE2 was my first zombie game and......I fell in love with this franchise right off the bat.\nI grew up on a steady diet of Sega Genesis games then I went to the N64 and my love of all things Mario.\nThen I finally broke down and got a PS2.\nRE2 was one of the first games I got for the system and it completely changed my outlook on games forever.\n\nI had never played such an adult oriented game.

So let's just keep this review centered around the Original Resident Evil 2 game for PSX 1.\n\nComparing RE 2 to RE or RE Director's Cut is like comparing Raw Horsemeat to a young Stallion.

Simple bottom line folks is that if your looking for a GOOD Survival Horror game... pick this one up.\n\nI had no real gripes towards the game and I felt that the DEVs of the game did everything in the better interest for the Resident Evil genre.

I was severely disappointed overall with it, and from what I've read, the whole series is the same, so I had little to no faith in it.  I didn't feel the need whatsoever to play the other games, and openly spoke out against the series, even though I only played one game.  But, after playing Resident Evil 4, I got intrigued by the story, so I decided to try out Resident Evil 1-3.  I thought, \"There's no way they can be worse than Code: Veronica, so why not?\"  And good god... was I right.\n\nAlthough the first RE was little more than a big laughable joke (thanks to the ridiculously horrible voice acting that makes what you find in Code: Veronica X look like an Oscar-winning performance), that wasn't really scary at all until the hunters came into the picture, the second iteration really blew me away.  Anybody who has known me for more than two seconds knows I don't care at all about graphics in a videogame, so I'm not going to say anything about them because it is irrelevant (which is why I'm not a GameCube or Xbox fan).  The gameplay is very good for a survival horror - there is plenty of puzzle solving, adventure, exploration, and combat to keep the interest level up.  That's what I like about survival horror: it's not just about fighting to stay alive, but it is also about exploring and solving puzzles to unravel the plot and make sense out of mysterious circumstances.  And, while Resident Evil 2 isn't anywhere near as scary or intricate in story as the Silent Hill series, it is still a top-notch game to play for any fan of the genre, and I highly recommend it.  The first one you can play on your own; I just played it because I wanted to know what Wesker did to get Chris so ticked off with him, and vice versa.  The reason the title of my review is \"I was wrong...\" is because I really was wrong in assuming that the Resident Evil series was a bunch of bunk and no worth anyone's time.  So, I apologize for being a presumptuous jerk.\n\nBut, there is one issue I just can't stop from addressing: the controversy over the control scheme.  Now, I won't go into one of my trademark rants insulting everybody, but I will state my thoughts from an objective point of view.  The reason survival horror games have such awkward controls is because the game developers wanted it that way.  This is a genre for puzzle solving, plotlines, exploration, and thought, not just about shooting things.  They made the controls this way to render it, in a way, a sort of \"anti-action\" type of game genre.  Still, though, once you get used to the controls, like me, you will have no trouble blasting zombies torsos in two soon enough.\n\nAnother thing that is cool about this game is the zombies and their... \"creative\" death sequences (okay, so maybe they die a second time, but this time for good).  Naturally, you can blow their heads off, but even more possibilities await your execution.  Sometimes, you can fire at them and their arm will be severed by your bullets, or with a shotgun you can shoot them at the base of their spine and they will be blasted in half, the upper section of their body crawling on the ground with its arms alone to try and bite you.  When you upgrade your shotgun later on, you can actually blow their chest in half!  And, with a rocket launcher, if you fire at them square in their torso, their arms, head, and a good portion of their upper body will be gone.  If you hit them to the right side, most of said side will be gone, as will their head and respective arm, yet their left arm will still be attached.  Pretty cool, huh?  Code: Veronica X didn't have anything like that, which is rather too bad.\n\nThe only problem I had with this game, and it really isn't a problem with the game itself, is that it really made me shake my head at Code: Veronica X.  It almost seems as if Capcom had taken a huge step backward in their videogame-making abilities.  Heck, even the first Resident Evil is better than REC:VX.  For example, in the first one, the hunters had narrow, sharp, reptilian eyes, rows of razor-sharp teeth that protruded from their mouths, and they looked pretty scary, but in Code: Veronica, they didn't have such teeth (it almost looked like they didn't have any at all), and they also had small, beady eyes, making them more of a joke than an intimidating enemy.\n\nYet another good part about this game is the Titan.  I must say, he is really one heck of a bad guy.  But, of course, he's nowhere near as bad*ss as the Nemesis or as terrifying as Pyramid Head.  But he's cool nonetheless.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if you like survival horror games, then I suggest you try this one out.  But don't expect it to be better than Silent Hill, if you're a fan of that series (just as a side note).", "summary": "I was wrong...", "unixReviewTime": 1136160000}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2005", "reviewerID": "AY3Y9ROK6LRPI", "asin": "B00000I1BJ", "reviewerName": "Michael Corona", "reviewText": "Resident Evil 2 - Circa 1998\n\nGOOD:\n\n- An upgrade over the original, which was considered a great game\n\n- Considered classic to many gamers\n\n- Good story, with twists and turns\n\nBAD:\n\n- Graphics look very dated\n\n- Voice acting is not that great\n\n- Controls feel dated\n\nWILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:\n\n- Slow moving \"survival horror\" game, which is more about moving boxes, managing items, and unlocking doors then actually fighting for your life\n\n- A Sc-Fi horror game set in a city over run with zombies, huge snakes, and all types of creatures\n\nGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:\n\n- Dino Crisis\n\n- Silent Hill\n\n- Alone in the dark\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES:\n\n- There is a remake of this game for the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo Game Cube both of which don't really upgrade anything\n\n- The male playable character (Leon) is also the star of Resident Evil 4\n\n- Beating the game in a certain way can unlock two new characters \"Hunk\" and \"Tofu\"\n\n- There was a rumor that you could unlock Akuma from Street Fighter Alpha as a playable character, but that is not true\n\n- In Japan Resident Evil 2 is called Biohazard 2", "summary": "Dawn of the Dead Video Game style", "unixReviewTime": 1126137600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2005", "reviewerID": "A2582KMXLK2P06", "asin": "B00000I1BJ", "reviewerName": "Bryan", "reviewText": "Now THIS is how you're supposed to enjoy blowing through a bloody, violent game!  Blood squirting from moaning zombie bodies.  It's so strange and relaxing to experience this.  I know you will laugh at what I am about to tell you, but I never bothered with this game when it first came out.  Yeah, I know, I lost many friends because of this.  I ignored this game in 1998, and my level of coolness went right down the tubes.  I had to fail math and pretend to smoke cigars to fit back in with my classmates again.\n\nChildren shouldn't play this game.  If you think it's ok for children to see the two main characters in this game shoot and fry their way through the police station then you might not be a reasonable person.  Yes that's right: you can walk through a police station in this game.  If in real life you have a problem with the way cops sit in a field and watch over you to make sure you have your seat belt on (and not one of those cases where you pretend to put the seat belt on until the cop is out of view and then take it off again) you now have a place to take out your frustrations- Resident Evil 2.\n\nThe weapons in this game are realistically cool.  I like pulling out the magnum and shooting zombies in the head and watching their heads blow to pieces.  Don't try this at home, but do try this on your Playstation.  The magnum doesn't make much noise so you wouldn't think it'd be such a bad-ass weapon, but you can shoot at the head of a zombie and watch his head quietly blow to smithereens.  You know you shouldn't do that in real life though, right?  You'd go to jail for a very long time.  And if you tried to explain to the police that you were shooting at zombies, you'd only get laughed at by the entire court room.  Use your head.\n\nIf this game doesn't satisfy your sick animal-like needs, then try looking for the fire blaster thing.  You can cook zombies with this.  It's near the end of the game hidden in a locker.  Go near the locker and press the X button, and it will open and you will say \"sweet\".\n\nIn this game you have two CD's.  One CD is for the Leon adventure, and the other CD is for the Claire adventure.  You can choose to start the game with either Leon or Claire.  To do the game completely you have to beat the game twice with Leon and twice with Claire.  I've only ever played this game on easy and I had a blast.  I'm sure on normal it's quite harder, maybe so hard you can't think straight and become dumb.  Of course you aren't dumb, it's just that video games can confuse you sometimes.\n\nMan I'm tired.  But I'm never too tired to take a couple hours from my easy-going day and blasting my way through this super cool game.  The only downside is that you can't skip the cutscenes.  That's fine at first, when you want to listen closely to the story (even though I didn't) but after a while you really wish Capcom would have put a skip button on this thing.\n\nStill, great game.  It's old, but please don't be one of those people who thinks that just because something is old it's not good.  I've been around people who think like that and they just ain't cool.  Sure, these people get all the girls and all the friends, but what else?  What's \"in\" sucks, and what's old is cool.  You think I'm wrong?  Good for you.

The story line is really entertaining but it was more of a sci fi then a horror story.  I won't spoil the story for you but the game is 2 discs and you control 2 characters(serpartly) in the game.  One is a cop named Leon Kennedy and the other is female after her missing brother Chris(who was in RE1)and the two end up meeting eachother and the rest you can figure out..\n\nI really enjoyed this game, it was fantastic.  I loved the graphics for this game it was just \"wow\".  The game is pretty short if you play only one half of the character you play as.  They both have 2 parts(kina).

Everything made me jump, now I have sort of gotten over that, I am 15 and although the music and sound(zombie moaning and feet stepping) creates this scary atmosphere, it is not THAT scary. Most of you can handle it.\nAnyways, I needed a strategy guide for some of it. It just, it just is unrealistic. Yea to put out a fire you need a crank in a cabin? Why was the crank removed in the first place. \"We need to make it so if there is a fire of some sort, this hose we have hooked up, will release some water.\" Yea they happened to put a handy dandy hose thingy in the ceiling, so just incase a helicopter crashed under it, or there was a mass fire under it, the hose would put it out. Yea right. Ok you need a cord just to close some shutters so zombies won't attack you? If the police were fighting, they should of closed these shutters beforehand, so less zombies came in. Instead, they decided to put the cord in an office about a mile away. Wanna get into that room? You need the crest and key and plugs buddy! How did the police actually get around this police station.\nMoving off of that, the game is alright. You have alot of ammo on easy, although I fear I will run out alot of the time, I usually find a pack or 2 to keep me going. The zombies themselves can take quite alot, like 5 hits to kill them. However once you get the pistol modification for Leon, they become a whole lot easier. The story is nice. 2 people trying to escape a city full of undead living thingy creatures and such. Theres alot of other characters though, you aren't the last 2 humans alive in the city. The game even though was known to have a sequel considering tremendous profits, finishes great. It starts randomly, but then ends where it should. It succeeds in making a good game. Good story, some action, you get to kill some of those evil zombies, and good package.", "summary": "Just got it, lives up to some of my expectations", "unixReviewTime": 1060560000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2003", "reviewerID": "AJKWF4W7QD4NS", "asin": "B00000I1BJ", "reviewerName": "N.

Resident Evil 2 had everything the original had plus tons more; bigger more detailed environments, weirder puzzles, more suspense, more blood and gore, and a compelling story that kept the gamer on the edge of their seat.  In this installment you play as rookie cop Leon Kennedy or Claire Refield: the sister of Chris from the first game.  Instead of a secluded mansion like the first game, this time all of Raccoon City has been infected by Umbrella's virus and you have to wade through an assortment of flesh eating zombies, mutated dogs, hunters, a new monster called the Licker (whose introduction in the game is one of the most unforgettable parts in any video game), and some unbelieveably grotesque beasts who will stop at nothing until your dead.  Resident Evil 2 was an instant smash hit upon it's release and has since been regarded as a classic video game and an essential play for any gamer.

I had just barely gotten the Playstation and was renting a bunch of stuff. Originally I hated this game because I couldn't figure out how to play it. I had been a Nintendan with occasional defects to Sega (I own a Genisis) so I was unfamiliar with what has become a nearly standard control style for Playstation games. I didn't understand the pivoting, nor did I grasp the concept of holding R-1 to aim and X to shoot. I got frusterated and set it aside. However, my brother picked it up immediately after and managed to get me past the first screen. (Yes I got killed right away.) I watched my brother navigate his way through the game until he finally got killed by the first Licker. He begged me to buy it. So I did. After a while I decided to give it another try, and once I got used to the control style I beat it. I have played this this Resident Evil, and it many different incarnations across differnt platforms more than any other version. I have also bought this one the most times trying to get the \"ultimate edition\" and eventually got tired of it and bought the Dual Shock Greatest Hits version after the N64 version's FMV sequences were so terrible. Although I will not buy the forthcomming GameCube port unless they imporove it as drastically as they did the original, I still recomend RE 2 as the most fun of the series. If for some reason there is someone out there who does not already have some version of this game do yourself a favor and pick one up.

Not in my world it's not.  Star Fox 64 uses eye candy and colorful animations to disguise several moments of mediocrity.  No doubt it uses eye candy to disguise the lack of challenge.  The reason the Super NES's Star Fox was so successful is because it's able to combine challenge with really intense atmosphere giving the gamer the impression he's helpless in the galaxy (especially whenever your life is low- a feeling you hardly encounter in Star fox 64).  The pressure would get really intense whenever you begin to lose your teammates (Peppy, Slippy and Falco) and you wonder how much longer you'll be able to survive.  However I feel no pressure whatsoever in Star Fox 64 regardless how many of my animal friends go down or how low my health meter is.\n\nI think the game is going for a cinematic feel while completely ignoring a degree of challenge.  The game certainly *looks* good.  Another problem is that the enemy variety is really lackluster and you're hardly ever swarmed with too many enemies which is a negative in my book because it means the intensity of the flight shooting isn't quite strong or memorable enough overall.  The music is another major disappointment.  Whereas on the Super NES the music was extremely catchy, suspenseful and memorable, no such treatment occurs here in Star Fox 64.  Instead every stage has quiet generic hard rock with no noticeable melody and it sounds really average to me.\n\nWhile I don't mind having your team constantly radioing in and giving advice, it was a better format on the Super NES when they didn't actually speak.  This is because Peppy, Slippy and Falco talk a LOT.  Slippy in particular sounds like a child which is grating.  The enemy Andross talks a lot too.  Every few seconds you'll hear them speak and while some of the stuff they say is surprisingly enjoyable, I don't really want to hear it every time I fly a mission.  Most everything they say is playful anyway.  The explosion of enemy aircrafts tends to feel like an afterthought too, with no suspense occurring there either.  Tame explosions instead of violent and memorable ones like in the original Star Fox.  This is partly due to enemies appearing significantly less frequently than in the Super NES's Star Fox.\n\nWell let me mention the levels.  Meteo is decent but a boring imitation of the same type of dark space stage we see in the Super NES's Star Fox where you're constantly surrounded by flying boulders and a high danger level.  In fact that's the biggest problem with this game- you swerve around traps and enemies *some* times, but it's never a very threatening or frequent occurrence.  It's a very tame flight you're taking most of the time.  Fortuna is a generic level with lots of flying and very little action.  Sector X is a high point due to featuring several moments of swarming around dangerous traps and closing objects while Titania is a pretty decent level while driving around on the ground in the landmaster vehicle.\n\nBoise Defense Outpost contains a force field, and it gets tedious chasing enemies for a while.  Katina is tedious as well since it takes forever to open hatches on enemies.  It's boring.  Solar is awesome however since it involves dodging giant snake-shaped fireballs.  Macbeth is a train chase on the landmaster.  It's a pretty fun stage but the boss fight is once again tedious since it takes forever to defeat.  Sector Y is an awesome outer space dark level avoiding floating space crafts.  Aquas Ocean is even MORE awesome!  Hey alright, some memorable levels for a change.  The statues you fly past are quite intimidating and the sight to see in this stage.  The eye candy graphics from the explosions are unique too.\n\nToxic Waste Area is a unique toxic ocean level with a tough as nails boss fight made of armor.  The snakes coming out of the toxic water is cool too.  Sector Z is generic and forgettable since it lacks combat.  Area 6 contains a memorable disappearing disc-shaped tentacle boss with a giant golden-colored planet in the background.  I admire this stage's appearance.  Venom: Andross Homeworld begins on a lackluster note featuring generic enemy chasing and shooting, but immediately after this part is over the level turns WAY more intense and atmospheric (claustrophobic in particular).  The Andross boss itself is memorable mainly for the intimidating appearance of his first form and less about the second form which involves shooting aimlessly and hoping you hit your target.\n\nBoss fights feel significantly less suspenseful perhaps due to them being easy with predictable weak points for one thing, and also the lack of suspenseful music.  This is why the Super NES version is so much better.

The game play was very easy and also very short. I've heard that there are some secret levels, but none that I have discovered yet.

A few times is ok, but in my opinion the creators of this game should have made pilots that knew how to take better care of themselves because there always whining and complaining.

Not the best space shooter. Star Fox on the Nintendo 64? 2ND BEST GAME ON THAT SYSTEM (The first is Ocarina of Time)! Every level was packed with thrilling action! On the first level I enjoyed an easy ride along Corneria, gliding across the lakes listening to Peppy complain. The 2nd level (Meteo) really picked up the pace, and the drama was incredible for the Nintendo 64. The level opens with Peppy saying \"It's quiet. Too quiet.\", quickly followed by, \"LOOK OUT IT IS A TRAP!!!!\", followed by a hoard of enemies, then giant meteors, ending with the most disturbing thing I've ever seen in a video game. A giant space craft swoops down and a monkey with a british accent says \"I can not allow you to go any further\". After a short time the british monkey says \"I am no match for you. I admit defeat.\" The whole game goes silent, and then the monkey yells \"IF THIS DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!\". He fires a huge amount of lasers, and then calls me scum after I defeat him. Time for Level 3! This one was also disturbing, but provided the greatest thrill I had ever had. The Star Wolf team comes in, saying some very creepy comments while they beat me. \"You'll be with your dad soon Fox!\" (Fox's dad is dead), \"I'm going to bust you up REAAALLL good!\" (says the pig who betrayed Fox's dad), and \"Go back to the pond, Froggy.\". Then, right in the middle of that big fight, the robot assistant comes in and says \"DANGER! A bomb has been discovered in the base! Explosion in 1 minute!\" Level 4 was at the climax of wierdness, though. A giant terminator-like robot came in and started repeating \"DESTROY! DESTROY!\". I have not been able to get level 4, the robot always crushes me and then I get Game Over. I do highly this game, though. It is possibly the most thrilling game on the N64!

It's more or less a rail shooter, but there's some free-roaming flight to be had at various points through the game. One of the best features of Starfox is that progression is non-linear. Your actions in each mission directly affect how you proceed through the game. For instance, if you defuse the bomb on one level, you go one route. If you fail, you end up playing a different level.\n\nGraphics: You have to be a little forgiving of Starfox in this area. It's a fairly early N64 game. In the grand scheme of N64 graphical quality, Starfox 64 is probably somewhere near the bottom. But if you're turning down the new 3DS Starfox in favor of the old school one released fifteen years ago, chances are you won't care about that.\n\nSound: The music is pretty good, as is the voice-acting. Although it lacks the polish and natural feel of some later N64 games with voice-acting, Starfox 64 still has one of the best uses of voice-acting on the system. Flying through space shooting aliens and talking on a radio to your teammates go hand in hand.\n\nThere's still a lot of fun to be had with Starfox, even after all this time.

I recently got it as my first and only Star Fox title; and, though I'm normally not a fan of games with shooting and space ships like this, this game succeeded in impressing!  Analyzing its features step by step, it's pretty hard to find reasons why this game shouldn't be loved:\n\nStoryline 10/10: The story is absolutely captivating!  Though it starts out pretty simple and generic (the galaxy and Corneria are being threatened by Venom, someone save us, etc.) the backstory behind it is pretty detailed, the intro is epic, and the story itself takes on a whole new life when you start playing!  Actually, YOU are the one who controls the story to a degree: you can pretty much decide, through skill and/or choice, whether things go great or awful for the Star Fox team, a heroic pilot crew you can manipulate.  You control Fox McCloud, and only Fox McCloud, but you also associate with the three pilots of Peppy, Slippy, and Falco; why, just protecting Falco and doing certain actions on the first level can decide which way the story goes!  This game does a great job of drawing you into its world and making you want to figure out what's happening.\n\nCharacters 9/10: I have to commend whoever came up with these interesting characters: they make the game!  Even on your own crew, each one is distinctive: Falco, for example, plays along the lines of \"the tough guy with a secretly caring heart.\"  Peppy is like the fatherly instructive type, and Slippy plays along the lines of a new school boy.  Finally, Fox, the same character you control, often takes on a reserved leadership role (which makes sense).  Each one has his own quirks; and, though any of them can be annoying on a certain level, you can't help but feel a degree of liking for each of them.  Their lines, though perhaps epic for the time, can be somewhat cheesy and/or cliche (Peppy's, \"It's Quiet . . . too quiet.\" is a good example); but the cheesiness adds to what is oddly a funny and light-hearted game.  You often can't help but think, \"I shouldn't be laughing at this,\" but you'll laugh anyway.  It's just that kind of game.  The A.I. of each character on maneuvering is decent; but, until you get skilled enough, it can be hard not to shoot at them or let enemies get them, as they get in your way at the oddest times (then fuss at you when you do hit them).  Peppy occasionally gives advice that doesn't particularly help either, though it hardly ever hurts if you follow it.  Speaking of advice, though, the game can make you depend on your characters if you're newer at it, as they can each do something useful: Peppy gives advice and often tells you where to shoot, Slippy analyzes boss health meters, and Falco often covers you.  If someone gets shot down, you'll miss him.  Finally, the characters are also pretty life-like in behavior: try shooting down enemies that Falco is chasing on some levels, and listen to his reaction to it.\n\nGraphics 9/10: Some issues with fog (common for Nintendo 64 games), but otherwise absolutely beautiful.  The fog itself, even, can be justified, as you spend most of your time in the air.  Though many stages take either a purely generic \"spacial\" theme, such as the asteroid field, the planets are really intuitive.  In this game you can find a volcanic environment, which even mimics the \"wavy\" effects of heat, an ocean environment (full of fish and plant life), a couple of cities, a train depot . . . the works!  The most interesting graphics you could see, however, has to be the part of the asteroid field you can \"warp\" to.  Though it probably looks like you've taken a medication or something else you shouldn't have, you can't deny the mysterious beauty of that point in the level. . . . Please note, however, that what levels you see depends on what paths through the game you take; like the story, it's dependent upon your actions in the levels.\n\nMechanics 9/10: This covers things like controls, ability to save, and learning curve (whether it's easy or hard to master).  The controls, though they work well, are pretty complicated to learn.  This complication, however, is eased by the nice training mode they threw in; a few rounds in training mode, and you'll pretty much have them down!  The game can still be pretty tough to a degree, though; however, I was able to nearly make it through the entire game on one of my first three rounds (and I'm usually not too hot at games like this), before the Star Wolf team finished me off (they're pretty tough if you don't know how to handle them right).  Make sure to master the somersault maneuver; I've never seen a game force you to rely on it as heavily as this one!  In terms of saving, I was disappointed: there's no way to save; and, unlike what some people say, there's no password feature either.  You'll probably get sick of the first level for that reason.  While it's not a deal breaker, this game isn't for the busy person who's looking to play for only an hour or less and quit.  If you want to experience the true value of this game, you'd better set aside at least a couple of hours for it.  The lack of a save feature is the biggest thing that kept me from giving this game a perfect score, as I kept catching myself thinking, \"This game would be perfect if only it had a save feature!\"\n\nMusic and Sound 10/10: No complaints in the music and sound department!  It pretty much captures the mood, be it suspenseful, hopeful, dramatic, or even rewarding.  The character voices are also well done, awesomely portraying the character personalities as well.  I can't describe any of this justly, though; you'll have to listen for yourself!\n\nConclusion: Star Fox 64 is a face of near perfection, if only a few small blemishes hadn't reared their ugly heads.  Multiplayer, I hear, is lacking; but, overall, none of the minor flaws in this game are major dealbreakers.  Personally, I recommend this game to people who are bored and have a lot of time on their hands; the replay value is great with its various paths!  The final boss can be downright creepy, and . . . well, I think any critique could easily go on forever!  Long story short, this game is an absolute steal at the cheap price it's at now.

Anyways, this game was put out 8 years ago and still every once and a while I decide to play this and I love it, cuase it has the talking animals on it.  I'm going to repeat this TALKING ANIMALS!  Slippy gets on my nerves though I just kill him becuase he always gets some guy on his ass and keeps bleating \"get this guy off my fox!\"  I wanna crack his skull everytime he says that it pisses me off.  Then theres that stupid chick that knows Falco (the bad ass of course) and she is annoying, I wish I could kill her becuase when you go to the Z zone she steals your kills so you can't get the freaking medal I HATE HER!  It is so annoying that she steals your kills!  Oh that has to be the worst part of the game, it's woefully madening.  Also to not are the apes who try to kill you, though they make the noble animal of the ape villanious they still have memoriable lines like \"ANDROSS I'VE FAILED YOU!!!\"  Then there is team wolf, they are tottaly bad!  They are pretty hard to kill on the other side of venom but like I said if you got the skills you may one day beat them (and you say this game is too easy!  OH MY GOSH!).

He works hard of course, cuase I'm controlling him.  Anyways the best characters are the bosses cuase they say stuff to you that's funny like that one boss \"admits defeat\" but then comes back after you cuase he was lying, what did you think you'd get off that easy!  HECK NO!  Anyways I hope you love this game as much as I do, becuase I say those lines everyday before I go to sleep, cause it bring hope.

Those of you who have played Mario Party 8 or 9 for the Wii can now see the humble beginnings of this popular series of hit family games.\n\nUnlike Mario Party 8, there is a somewhat more interesting storyline where the six most famous characters of the Mushroom Kingdom (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, DK, and Wario) are arguing over who could be the Super Star. After a rather amusing argument sequence, the six are placated by Toad to play a variety of games in order to achieve good deeds and become the Super Star.\n\nWhen held in comparison of the boards of Mario Party 8 and 9 for the Wii, the boards of Mario Party 1 are still holding up well. Naturally, the graphics are incredibly dated, but the design is a tad more intricate and focuses on gameplay instead of the visual style. The rules are the same for each board also:\n- You and three other players move around the board in a predetermined amount of turns\n- Play addictive and fun mini-games\n- Collect coins and (hopefully) a star or two\n- Try not to run into Bowser who will cause nothing more but trouble and steal your money or stars\n- And after each amount of turns play out, you get a cool little cinema of victory if you win.\n\nWhile I consider Mario Party 8 visually better and more entertaining, this game is still a classic and not just because it started the Mario Party craze.

On the plus side, there are some memorable mini games where you had to work together to win the game and personally we didn't see that until Mario Party 9 with the boss battle.\n\nThe game overall had the most nostalgic feel and introducing the character's personalities through the stages. This game kind of set up Peach's obsession with cake and Luigi being the gadgeteer of the two brothers. The music for the stage is very cute especially in Rainbow Castle. I love how whoever gets 4th place gets the butt monkey treatment and attacked by the stage while 1st player achieves the mission needed.\n\nOverall, a good start for the series, but good luck finding this game. This game never reached the virtual console because of the controls so its a rare find in any trade in store without it being at extremely high prices.", "summary": "Mario Party Started it All in This (Hard) Party Game", "unixReviewTime": 1363910400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2012", "reviewerID": "ADUDTHE4Q6832", "asin": "B00000IFRI", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "NintendoSonyGamer", "reviewText": "Presentation:\nBack in the day Nintendo wanted another fun multiplayer game to create that doesn't exactly involve racing and thus the first of many Mario Party games was created. Let's see how they did in this new evolution to one of the most influential franchises in gaming.\n\nGameplay:\nThis was one of the first Nintendo games to include 4 player multiplayer and boy did people love this! Basically this game is like a board game, you start off with 10 coins and you roll a dice to determine where you go depending on the spaces you land on you can have fortunate things happen to you, unfortunate things, or you can end up gaining or losing coins. At the end of each turn the 4 players compete in a mini-game where the winner has a chance to win 10 coins. You want coins so you can have enough to buy a Star from Toad or maybe even have Boo steal one for you. When you've made a whole lap around the board depending on the time of the game Koopa Troopa will give you neither 10 or 20 coins. After 20-50 turns when the game ends youhave a chance to win bonus stars, the person with the most stars after that wins! The gameplay is a lot of fun whether you are playing alone or with friends. 9/10\n\nMusic and Sound Effects:\nThe music is very catchy to listen to, and the sound effects are good for the most part. The voice acting however is hilarious, nothing like hearing Wario yell \"DOH! I MISSED!!\". 8/10\n\nStory:\nThe story is for the most part an amateur story. However most Mario games are, Mario and his friends one day argue about who is the best and they decide to find out who is through multiple games of Mario Party. In the meantime Bowser trys to cause trouble for the characters and they end up eventually defeating him at his volcano. Angered by this he tries to defeat them again in space, luring them there by stealing their stars. They once again defeat Bowser, and the winner of that game is declared the Superstar. The default winner of the game is Wario. 6/10\n\nOverall:\nMario Party is a great single player and multiplayer game. And can be enjoyed by anyone of any age though the game is out of date I find this to be one of the best of the Mario Party series.

I get the concept and it's a really good one. Then why did I give it one star? This game is created for people who find Call of Duty and Halo so easy they get bored and refuse to play them. The mini-games must be beaten absolutely flawlessly or you don't get any points whatsoever. Sometimes you even lose points for not absolutely mastering the mini-game. If you're 99% perfect, sorry no points. The biggest flaw in this game is that it has to be four players. If you don't have four players then the computer will take over the rest. Be warned, the computer always wins every single mini game. There's a choice for computer skill...easy, normal, or hard...huh? What is hard skill? Does that mean the game is hard for the computer player or the computer player is hard for you to beat? No explanation whatsoever. But, it does not matter, Ive tried all three settings multiple times and it makes no difference in the computer's amazing flawless skill at mastering the game. The point of the game is to get 20 coins, by absolutely mastering the mini-games as flawlessly as inhumanly possible, then randomly landing on the space where Toad is selling stars for 20 coins. Watch out, there's also a space where, if they have 50 coins, other players can steal your star. They should call this game Star Stealers. The only real trick to the game is to be the one who lands on the star stealing spot the most times...and thus steal everyone else's stars. There's no friendly competition here...it's all about bing underhanded. If you don't have 50 coins to steal a star you can, for zero coins, steal coins from other players. this game always leads to everyone ganging up on the player who is doing the best. There's no skill involved to winning the game over all because it's all about who's lucky enough to land on the star stealing spot the most times. One turn your in first place and the next your in fourth, but when you're in fourth you're stuck. Whoever happens to have the most stars when the game ends wins the game no matter how poorly you played the game. Oh, and don't forget they the shortest version of the game takes 45 minutes minimum. The longest version takes 3+ hours. Ridiculous and frustrating to no end. Its a game that takes a minimal of an hour to lose. No thank you!

The controls are spot on so you were able to get into this game easily. It even includes the secret cars by hitting certain buttons at the select screen such as the bus.\n\nThe Bad Qualities: This game was one of the first titles to be released soon after the Nintendo 64 made is debut and it shows. While the graphics are crisp and bright, they were also choppy at times during gameplay and this game was one of the first to feature massive \"pop up\" graphics: graphics that suddenly appeared out of thin air. While the arcade game suffered from this as well, it wasn't as bad and the overall draw distance was better than the N64 port. The digital voice samples along with the audio in the N64 port were muffled; it sounded like it was playing out a paper bag. The cars controlled in the same way so there was no difference in what you picked to play during the stages.\n\nIf you were a fan of the Cruisin arcade series, be warned that this is a decent port of the first title in the series and like the first arcade game, had little variety in the control of the cars and the stages.

So the story is very weak. Things are often like that for multiplayer-centered games. At least Mario Party had actually TRIED to spice things up with a story. Where's the story for Super Smash Bros.? Where's the story for Mario Kart 64? I didn't think so. As weak as the Mario Party story is, the story isn't important for a game...the gameplay is. Some games with great stories have fallen flat because of poor gameplay. Other games with NO story succeed with great gameplay. Mario Party is definitely in the latter category. You can hate the Mario Party series for its excellent \"Land Before Time\" impression. You can be among the groups of people that prefer Mario Party 2 and Mario Party 3. Yet there is one thing that you must admit. Mario Party was DARNED fun back in 1999! Sure, people said to NEVER play with one person, but playing all four characters as one person can be a blast as well.\n\nAnticipation may have been the first board-game video game for Nintendo, but it wasn't exactly successful, and had relatively primative gameplay. So people now associate Mario Party with the introduction of board-game video game, and it's definitely more like a board game than any other game before it. I mean, you \"roll a dice\" and move around the board encountering various pitfalls and experiencing different events. Although most of the boards are well-designed, I have realized that the majority of the \"board-game\" aspect is text or movement, and somebody watching a tape with only footage the \"board-game\" aspect would likely get very bored very fast. But what makes Mario Party the gem that it is are...the mini-games! Yes, Mario Party has 56 mini games to entertain all souls from all walks of life. Sure, not all mini-games are perfect, but you know what? Even with all of the blisters, broken glasses, and white powder appearing on the N64 controller, the mini-games are still worth it! Especially Mushroom Mix-Up and Running of the Bulb. Oh yeah. Those are great games. Mushroom Mix-Up provided tons of frantic fun and Running of the Bulb was hectic but exciting. 4-player teamwork games really need to make a comeback.\n\nBeing a title developed by a third party (yes, Hudson is a 3rd party developer), the graphics in Mario Party are not exactly polished. Most of the textures are just simple polygons. And as was stated, the water is in the Bombs Away game is extremely pixelated. These graphics are not the ones that are so grand that you can't help but go \"Uah,\" but why bother with visual aesthetics when the game is already filled with gameplay finesse. At least the graphics don't hurt your eyes. I can't say that about a game that game out 3-4 months after Mario Party...I'm sure you all know what it is. Sound. Sound effects are amusing, but not exactly something special. Voice acting is good, but I finally found out (after five years) that much of the voice samples were lifted directly from the Japanese version of Mario Kart 64. The music? It is fantastic! There's a hint of Super Mario Bros. mixed in with the rest. It's great to listen to, even if it is all just MIDIs. Okay, a lot of this is probably due to nostalgia. I can write a paper on nostalgia and Mario Party, but I'll leave it at this. The bottom line is, even though Mario Party isn't one of the technologically advanced games on the N64, it sure makes up for it with its incredible gameplay.", "summary": "The Best Game of 1999!", "unixReviewTime": 1103241600}, {"overall": 2.0, "vote": "2", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2004", "reviewerID": "A1V3IO23FZFF9L", "asin": "B00000IFRI", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "chicoer2003", "reviewText": "At first I didn't like this game, then I got into it.

Besides the overall poor quality of the game, there was that camera!  Honestly, whoever designed that thing needs to be smacked with a wet fish.\nI played levels 1 through 10, and then had to stop just before the end of the game because I was nauseated and had an eyestrain headache.  I am not exaggerating.\nThe camera has a tendency to swirl around when you need it to stay still, and to sit still when you need it to move.  The grainy, pixelated graphics and complete lack of distinguishing features in the levels make it not only very easy to get lost, but also very hard on the eyes.  When you need to jump across platforms or walk AROUND something, that's when things really get bad.  Flik leaves almost no shadow on the ground when he jumps, so your jumps will usually be blind leaps of faith.  The other problem is his feet.  He dangles his feet so low when he jumps, that 9 times out of 10 you will miss a platform because his feet won't plant on it.  And, when he does land, he won't stop running, which will send him promptly stepping right off the other end of the thing and forcing you to do the jump all over again.\nThe other problem is the camera angles when walking around something.  When you walk around to the other side of a large object, for some idiotic reason, the camera does not follow you.  As a result, you are sitting there with your entire screen filled in by this object while you can't see Flik on the other side.  Now, as if that situation is not bad enough, picture yourself having to do a platform jump while your view of Flik is completely blocked by a large rock on the screen, or being hit by an enemy that you can't see because the camera won't move.  Instead of turning with you, you must stop for about 5 seconds after turning to allow the camera to \"catch up.\"  At the same time, the camera has a tendency to turn even while you're just running straight ahead in a single direction, which results in you being completely reversed.  It's completely disorienting, and with the bland, nearly identical levels, you can find yourself lost and irritated very frequently.\nIt's all fun and games, until you've developed a tension headache trying to look at the bad graphics and camera angles, and flung your controller across the room because you just don't feel like attempting that same jump for the 89th time.

A bad movie tie in game?  Well, what else is new?  A Bugs life for the Playstation is a almost universally hated game.  I really didint know what to expect when I first fired it up to try it out.  Did I like it?  Not a whole lot.\n\nYou start the game where you must get to your anthill.  You start walking around, getting used to playing, listining to Flick talking, following Dot, and killing evil bugs.  In a few minutes however, you start to realize something.  Flick will not be quiet.  He keeps going on and on and on and on and on and on and on with his annoying comments.  You finish the level and go on to the next level and keep up this pattern untill the end of the game.\n\n  Up untill then, if you haven't tried to get all the little goodies, you will have had a fun time.  But when you play again to try and get all the secrets, the trouble really begins.  For instance, to unlock a movie clip, you must collect all the letters of your name, collect 50 grain kernals, and kill all the bad bugs.  Sounds simple right?  Dont be an idiot.  getting all the grain pices is fairley hard but manigable.  Getting your name is really tough.  In one area you will see the letter F for F-L-I-C-K  To get it, you have to get a tall stalk.  To get the tall stalk, you must collect green tokens scattered throughout the level to power up the stalk power.  After collecting all the tokens, some of which are guarded by really tough bad bugs and others that are placed where you have to use another bug power to get it, you can finially reach the letter...once you get a seed.  Which is located a mile away from the letter.  You have to get the seed and take it to the letter, all the while getting attacked by bad bugs and listining to Flicks annoying commentary.  Once you get the stalk, put it in place and break it open, climb the stalk and get the letter.  Wasent that fun kids!  And you have to do that for EVERY SINGLE LETTER!!!! And don't forget that you have to kill all the bad bugs.  To do that you have to get the tokens for berry power, which are located throughout the level.  However some of them are located out of reach, and you can only reach them by getting a tall plant to help you out.  To do that, you must collect green tokens and get seeds to help you out and yada yada yada yada blah blah blah.\n\n  Get the idea of how frustrating this game can be?  And along with all that, Flick does not shut up, he keeps saying something every 10 seconds.  Along with all these problems, you have to deal with bad graphics, a annoying camera and some really HARD token collecting levels later on in the game (Such as the tree level)\n\nA bugs life does have a few nice points.  Some of the levels are neat, such as the boss battles.  The final battle with Hopper at the end of the game is very cool.  The music is by far the best part of the game, almost all of the tunes are very memorable and addictive.  But beyond that, the things that try to enable replay value almost destroy the game.

Even though this game came out in the later stage of the N64's run, it has the graphics of a third party release title. (Read: They're not all that great.)  Everything about the game reaches towards high concepts, but almost nothing reaches its goal.  The idea is that you are a timetraveling hero who has to save the world from various attacks from interstellar insects throughout history.  While the story is pure fluff, the gameplay (at least in theory) is not.  DMA is well known for the Grand Theft Auto series of games, and Body Harvest follows a similar formula.  You shoot things, then you get into various vehicles and shoot more things.  The main difference is that in Body Harvest you don't want to run innocent people over.\nThe controls are innovative and simple, but not very well implimented.  Its easy to get the hang of walking and driving the multitudes of cars/boats/planes/tanks, but the controls are too lose for your character to move around with much precision.  In addition, the aiming system also fails to live up to its high concept.  Basically you press the aim button, which brings up a cool looking recticule, but limits your movements.  However, since the enemies are so slow and predictable, and the areas are so spacious, battles boil down to mere shooting galleries.  When the enemies get tougher, faster, and more numerous in the later levels, it remains a shooting gallery, just with the bugs doing the shooting.  At this point in the game, vehicles become not just the coolest part of the game (and they are cool) but totally necissary, since you are toast without them even on the easy difficulty.  Combat in vehicles, even with aiming cababilities, usually devolve into shooting whatever is right in front of you.\nBasically, this is a high concept game that didn't quite make the grade and feels very rushed (despite the fact that I waited a long time during its extended development.)

This entry was made with the help of british developer EIDOS in exchange for Crystal Dynamics' help in producing Soul Reaver and Tomb Raider: Revelations, but I digress.\nThis game picks up after Gex: Enter the Gecko with series baddie Rez kidnapping Gex's partner, Agent Xtra. Gex then heads back to the Media Dimension to save Extra and stop Rez once again.\nGex 3 is the second 3D Gex game and is unique in a few ways. Firstly, none of the levels repeat. In previous Gex games you would encounter multiple levels with the same theme. For example you'd complete a level based on horror films and then later in the game you'ld come across another one. Each level in Gex 3 on the other hand is unique. There is only one level per theme. One Mystery channel, one Anime channel, etc.\nThe Gameplay is largely the same as it was in Gex: Enter the Gecko. You control the camera with the shoulder buttons this time around, but it can still be a major problem when judging distance while platofrming. The other addition is a number of costumes that give you minor upgrades, like a vampire cape to glide, a superhero costume, or a tunic to make you strong. These are interesting and add some variety, however they're under utilized and don't show up very often. This game also appeared on the N64, however there are fewer voice clips and no 3D cutscenes. The other difference between the two is that the Mythology channel, a parody of the old Hercules movies and Clash of the Titans, has a different level design. On the PS1 it's set on Mt Olympus, and on the N64 it's set in Hades. Now a game changer, but a nifty fact.\nDana Gould returns to voice Gex, who is still amusing to listen to and Marliece Andrea plays Agent Xtra. If you're playing a PAL version Gex is played by Danny John-Jules, known for playing The Cat on BBC's Red Dwarf. The unique levels have their own set of jokes which greatly reduces the chance of repetition which was a problem with the previous games.\n\nIt's a shame that no new games have been made since, but this was a pretty good conclusion.

Kinda wierd huh? Well in this game a woman named Agent Xtra was captured by Rez. When Gex was at home thinking about his last successes he decided to watch the news. When he was in the middle of watching the news he saw that Agent Xtra was captured by Rez. So Gex decided to go and save Agent Xtra. So he goes to the Gex caves and starts his new adventure.\nWhat you gotta do is you have to go to new t.v. levels and collect as many t.v. remotes as you can. Remember, the more remotes you collect the closer you will get to Rez. In this game Gex wears all sorts of different costumes like Hercugex, Supergex, Privategex, Dracugex, Little Red Riding Gex, and Sherlockgex. There is a whole lot more, but I cannot name them all. Gex also has rides too like Al Nino the donkey which can help Gex go up hills that are too slippery for Gex to climb and Humps the camel which can help Gex cross sinky sand and there are a few others. There are secret characters that you can play in the bonus rounds, but you have to find them first before you can play them. There is Rex which is Gex's prehistoric ancestor and Cuz which is Gex's cousin.\nThis game is really fun to play and not only that, the graphics are very nice and colorful. The colors in this game are much brighter than the other Gex games which makes this game even better and more fun to play, but the camera is a bit slow, but that is ok. You will get used to it after a while. The bad thing about this game is that there is adult language in it. It says bad words like d--- and s---. While you are playing this game you will hear really, really, really funny one-liners from Gex, but some of them have bad words in the one-liners or shall we say quotes. Believe me do not let kids under the age of 10 to play this game. That was the reason why I gave this game a four star instead of a five star. But hey, this game is okay for the whole family anyway, if you have a child that is younger than the age of ten and you don't want your child to hear the bad words than you are lucky, because there is a way to turn off the voice of Gex that way Gex won't even speak at all. You can turn the Voice from Gex off by going to the pause menu.\nWell that is all I have to say about Gex3: Deep cover Gecko. If you ever buy this game I hope you will like it as much as I did.

Syphon Filter proved that you can make this genre work on the PS1. The game is still really fun today and was way ahead of its time. A well done camera, great lock-on system, a decent story with memorable characters, a kick-ass arsenal of guns, and genius level design. Who would have thought a third person shooter would be this good in the late 90s? Eidetic and 989 Studios did.\n\nYou play as super spy Gabriel Logan who is a CIA agent trying to stop a dangerous terrorist named Eric Rhoemer. A Syphon Filter virus that targets specific DNA demographics has been created by a man named Phagan and it is up to you to shut down their operations and stop them from spreading the virus. You start out in New York with the streets being shot up by Rhoemer's thugs. There are objectives in each level to complete, but it is way beyond throw this switch, pull this lever, or shoot this amount of bad guys. You usually have to kill a certain amount of scientists, administer vaccines to victims, disarm bombs, turn off power grids. The objectives vary, but what is fun is figuring out how to get there.\n\nSyphon Filter has some of the most memorable levels I can remember. This is a game you play several times and remember where every enemy is, every crate location, and even how to kill each enemy. The levels vary with stealth sections, climbing, and timed areas. The game features a smart lock-on system because there is no camera control. It is surprisingly smart and follows you wherever you go. Enemies wearing flak jackets can only be taken out with head shots or very powerful weapons. This requires aiming in first person mode and taking them out. This flak jacket element is a staple of the series and will go on to be in every game. It is actually an element all on its own and not just body armor for you or the enemy. You can die very easily and if you don't stop and aim for head shots you will waste ammo and/or die very quickly.\n\nThere are a couple of boss fights thrown in such as a helicopter midway and Rhoemer himself at the end. I found all gameplay elements to be evenly tossed up so you are never bored. The stealth elements need a bit of work and are probably the worst thing about the game, but it is very minor. Crouching and sneaking around works fine, but enemies tend to see you at unknown distances. Maybe a line of sight cone on the radar would help this. You also have to get in head shots otherwise they won't die right away and alert other guards.\n\nWeapon selection is also a bit flimsy because you have to hold down select and use L2 and R2 (strafe buttons) to select the weapon. I would have preferred a radial menu instead. Some levels can be a bit hard to navigate are too dark to see. Thankfully you get a flashlight you can equip because some levels are nearly pitch black. I found myself lost a few times because even though the level design is fantastic, some levels can look the same with confusing hallways and misplaced crates and boxes.\n\nI actually learned about weapons as a kid from this game. Real world weapons are in here and some that I have never seen in any other game before. The weapons are almost a character all on their own because they feel so good to shoot in the game. The K3G4 will cut through flak jackets easily and is probably the only weapon that will do this. The G18 is a super fast sub-machine pistol, while the silenced 9mm is a staple of the series. The shotgun, combat shotgun, PK-102, BIZ-2, Nightvision Rifle, .45, HK5, and a few more are all excellent weapons. It was also the distinct sounds the developers used that make these guns so memorable. The game has a great sniper scope that was unseen in games back then. There are grenades and gas grenades which are great for taking out a group of enemies stealthily. There are a lot of great weapons in the game and they are very memorable unlike most shooters.\n\nWhile the game itself is amazing the graphics were pretty good at the time. Looking pretty realistic art wise, the game had some good lighting effects and a lot of detail everywhere. I also have many fond memories of this game as a kid. I actually accidentally rented Silent Hill because I forgot the name of this game. I got all the way to the Pharcom Warehouse levels and had to turn the game in. I rented this game many times over and played it to death as a kid. I purchased it a few times here and there and every time I play this it brings back fond memories.

Everything looks very matter of fact... This isn't a beautiful game to behold. The psn version that I have glitches and freezes up often, I don't know if that was a problem in the original or not but it probably was. The Gabe Logan 3D model is the worst that I've seen in a ps1 game, he has a Sasquatch body with a Lego character face, and stands and walks like Sasha Mitchell. That has nothing to do with the limitations of the system but instead it's a limitation of the artistic ability of the people working on the game. Controls are pretty close to as bad as it gets, very hard to steer your character, mostly worthless auto-lock targeting. There is some creativity to the level design, some okay variety, but there was better stuff being made back then.

That's what I think.  Syphon Filter is atrocious.  I received this game as a Christmas present (gee, what a crappy gift) back in the late 90's.  I thought to myself \"well, all the N64 players have Goldeneye, I can compete with them when I receive Syphon Filter for my Playstation!\"  How wrong I was.\n\nIt's not that the actual game is bad.  I mean, walking around shooting people is fun, and it's also fun to avoid being seen and make it to the end of the level without having to fire your weapon once (and having to remain VERY quiet while doing so).  The problem is that the difficulty is incredibly high and the storyline is about as interesting as watching the paint your baby brother smeared all over your television set dry.\n\nWithout a certain special code it's REALLY hard to get *anywhere*.  The storyline is similar to one you'd see in the TV show Jag.  It's just not interesting to me.  Walking around shooting people is fun, but that's all the game has going for it.  Now imagine if that special code didn't exist where you can kill people in just one or two shots.  The difficulty would be out of this world.\n\nI also hate the game for the bad memories connected to it.  The Christmas I got the game, I had a few bad personal things happen.  But looking back, Syphon Filter really isn't any good. It's not surprising to me that the game is going for only a couple pennies right now used, and only a couple dollars to buy brand new.

Intrigued, I went ahead and bought it, popped it in my Psone, and to this day, it is one of the best games I have ever played. I have beat the 1st, 2nd and 3rd, and am on my second \"pass\" through the series. I will then give the \"Omega Strain\" a go on my PS2 once I am finished with SF3. While I have read no so favorable reviews on OS, I think it would be fair to at least give it a try.\n\nYou are \"Gabe\" Logan, a special operative for a super secret government orginization aptly named \"The Agency\". Your mission is to find a dangerous chemical stolen by terrorists from a lab and stop them before they destroy the world. You are remotely partnered with Lian Xing, another agent who guides you through your missions and later on in the game is in action on the ground.\n\nYou are gradually given an arsenal of weapons as each level moves forward. Among them are: There is the Silenced 9mm handgun, the .45 handgun, the G-18 Pistol-machine Gun, , the HK-5 Pistol Machine Gun, the Shotgun, the Combat Shotgun, the PK-102 Assault Rifle, the M-16 Assault Rifle, and the K3G4 Assault Rifle just to name a few.\n\nIn each mission based level, you must accomplish a variety of objectives, and eliminate a tough boss at different intervals. You will use stealth at times, or just face enemies head on. The interesting part about this game is that it really draws you in, and takes some interesting twists and turns as it progresses.\n\nAs for gameplay, it is fantastic and addicting. While the levels are challenging and tough at times, they are not overly frustrating or extremely hard. Some levels and missions are easy, and others will take a few times to get through. It will be a bit of a challenge if you play this for the first time, but you won't become overwhelmed as in similar games. As you play it a second and third time,though, you will become familiar with the layout of the levels and more or less breeze through. As an example, I was able to shoot down the chopper on the base tower after 5 tries, as opposed to 30 attempts during my first run through the game over a year ago. You will also attain some \"tricks\" along the way as well, such as becoming more effective at headshots and so on. I have found that it's the \"little\" things that get you through this game.\n\nAs for game layout and graphics, excellent, IMO for 1999 PS1. Great voice animations and camera angles as well.\n\nWhile there are many new games out, especially in the wake of the XBOX 360 and PSP releases, I still encourage you to give this masterpiece a try.

While the levels are large and fairly well designed, the quite average graphics caused problems when you get close to surfaces.  The games controls also suffer from problems, mostly in terms of the targeting function, which is useful for quick aiming in tight spaces, or when an enemy is moving fast, yet will often aim for enemies you can't hit, when you are being shot at by ones you can, or even aim behind you, throwing the camera into wild spinning and throwing your character out of control.  Fortunately auto-aiming removes the necessity of using targeting in most circumstances.  In some places, infinately respawning enemies will cause a great deal of frustration (just to be fair, I did set off an alarm, but still...).  Some puzzles are good without being [dumb] and contrived, but some were just plain stupid, especially one early in the game where some explosives you just happen to need are hidden in a box in a dark corner of the level.  Some triggered events (especially spawning) are odd, for example, on one level, if you haven't completed a certain objective, you will die without much explaination.[...]\n\nWhile these flaws greatly detracted from my playing experience, The story is fairly good, certain levels are very fun, and the game hardly ever throws anything so hard that it's agrivating at you.  One battle with a helicopter is a little bit overwhelming, although the hardest part comes at the end of the battle when you have to remember to take off your targeting to hit some enemies.\n\nOverall, Syphon Filter is a great game executed poorly, but I have high hopes for the sequal.

You could probably find someone selling a Japanese Sega Saturn on eBay or something, but that's a lot of trouble and who wants to buy an entire foreign system just to play just one great game (and maybe X-Men vs. Street Fighter too!)?\n\nAs far as the PlayStation version goes, you are forced to select only one fighter and an assisting teammate due to the PlayStations lack of RAM and VRAM (the Japanese Sega Saturn version requires a packed-in 4 MB RAM Cartridge which allows the game to play exactly like the Arcade version with minimal load times). However there is a trick if you are playing a 2 player game! If both players select the same characters, then you are able to play the game the way it was meant to be played: 2 vs. 2 tag-team! This game plays almost exactly like the previous years X-Men vs. Street Fighter on PlayStation with some new features and different characters. If you liked the way the PlayStation port of Marvel Super Heroes played then you will like this even better since it is more of the same with more character variety and more colorful graphics. Aside from the cutbacks in gameplay style and missing frames of animation (another downside to the PlayStations lack of RAM!), this game is enjoyable enough if you aren't obsessed with the Arcade verion too much. I would still go for the Japanese Sega Saturn version since it is Arcade perfect or wait (and hope) for Capcom to release a Marvel Anthology or another Capcom Arcade Classics compilation with X-Men: Children of The Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, this game, Marvel vs. Capcom and Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

And to be quite honest, playing Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter only reminds me of how great the series used to be. Sure, the game is mildly entertaining, but without the true tag team gameplay that the arcade version of the game had, it comes off as just another Street Fighter game with Marvel characters. The character roster totals out at 17, with nine from the Street Fighter universe and eight from Marvel. There are five modes of play including battle, versus, training, hero battle, and crossover. Battle and versus are your typical one- and two-player fighting game modes. Hero Battle is an endurance mode that separates the groups to see which has the stronger stable of fighters. Nothing special here. Crossover mode, however, is at least somewhat interesting. You see, in the original version of MSH vs. SF you could pick two fighters whom you could switch between at any time during the fight. This tag team style of fighting was first featured in the arcade version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter but couldn't make it into the PlayStation port due to the technical limitations of the PlayStation. Sadly, the tag team aspect of MSH vs. SF was also excluded for the same reason. Sure, you can still pick two characters, but you can only play as one of them. The second character only comes into play when you execute a team combo or team counter. Crossover mode tries to bring the game's main selling point home. This mode allows you to pick two characters, then the computer uses the same characters you picked. This limits the amount of information the PlayStation has to handle to two characters instead of four. If you are victorious in this battle, the computer swaps one of the characters each of you have for another. This is done so that you aren't playing with and against the same two characters each fight. It gives you the tag team experience of the arcade, but having to deal with the rotating character thing and having to fight mirror images of yourself is extremely weak. Visually, MSH vs. SF looks good. But when you compare it with its arcade counterpart, it simply fails. The colors aren't nearly as vibrant, and the game suffers from quite a bit of slowdown. It still comes across better than the PlayStation version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter, though, because not nearly as much animation was cut out. This is a major plus, since frames of animation not only affect the game's appearance but timing and gameplay as well. On the gameplay side, Street Fighter fans will definitely feel the typical Street Fighter gameplay. But in the end, it's all a question of how starved you are for another Street Fighter game. Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is all about the tag team mode, and with the overall exclusion of this mode, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is just another Street Fighter game.", "summary": "Pretty good", "unixReviewTime": 1060732800}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "5", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 6, 2000", "reviewerID": "A3EU0FX5OZZ32P", "asin": "B00000IPEE", "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "reviewText": "If you don't have a Dreamcast and you love Capcom's Vs. games, Marvel Super Heroes Vs.

For instance, the biggest let down is the abscence of tag-teaming (the Playstation does not have enough RAM to store more than 2 characters within one loading session).  Then there's the animation...there are definetly more than a few frames missing, but once you get used to it it's OK.  However, there a few gameplay extras Capcom included to keep players interested: a \"helper\" character for each match, a healing vitality gauge, and a combo system that allows you to chain hyper combos together.  Best of all though, the gameplay stays relatively fast with minimal slowdown (with the exception of extreme activity).

Otherwise, to get more tracks you have to to go to Championship Race, and get the other tracks. I look at these cheat things on the Internet, and a lot of them don't mention that you can unlock tracks, so I wanted to tell people that yes you can unlock tracks - (6 racing tracks altogether) 4 tracks plus there are these multiplayer tracks to unlock. There are more multiplayer tracks, but these are simpler. They aren't real racing tracks like the other 6. Think of them like battle games such as the ones on Mario Kart 64.\n\nNow, some people might say 6 racing tracks (other than multiplayer, that's it?? Cruisin USA 64 has 14 tracks.. However, the 6 tracks are not normal tracks. They are about twice as long as other racing games I have played such as Destruction Derby, Cruisin USA, Monster Truck Madness 64, etc. You can play 3 laps of a course such as Coventry Coves, and you are ending it in 7-8 minutes. This is without stops, or crashes. The handling is good on this game, so you probably wouldn't crash to begin with.\n\nAgain, the only thing I really don't like is that you to win the championship races to win so much. They should have had 6 tracks they give you already + 2 extra tracks you win with the championship races, and more cars to win with the championship races.

One of them, Beetle Adventure Racing, was exclusive to the system and proved to be one of the best racing games to grace the Nintendo 64. Released in 1999, it was an arcade racer with the physics seen in serious racers but poked fun at itself all throughout the game.\n\nIn BAR, you pick from a variety of Volkswagen Beetles and choose from one player mode(single and championship), two player mode(race only) and beetle battle mode (two to four players.) Select from one of six tracks (first one only available from the start.) and you're off! There are tons of stuff to unlock and the only way to get everything is by playing through the championship mode and beating the four difficulty levels. As you pass each track, it becomes available in the other game modes. As you beat the game under each difficulty level, you unlock additional versions of Beetles. There are \"number\" boxes scattered throughout each track. They count as points and need to be collected to earn \"continues\" and depending on the difficulty level, you need a certain amount. You can earn up to 100 points; collect them all and you unlock a multi-player track for the Beetle Battle mode (only one track is available from the start) Lastly, there are \"flower\" boxes hidden throughout each track. Finding them unlocks cheats that you can turn on and off under the options screen.\n\nThe PROS: There is so much content packed in this game, you get your money's worth instantly. First off, the graphics, music, sound effects, controls and game play are impressive for a racing game on the N64. Then, there is the satisfaction on unlocking the bonus content for you and your friends to enjoy later. This game shows how to give players an incentive to play through the game entirely and have something to show for it. Each track is huge and there are multiple surprises and shortcuts that each lap promises you a different experience each time. The different versions of Beetles are pretty damn cool and its worth unlocking all of them. The Beetle Battle mode is fun to play with your friends and is a game within itself (the tracks are huge so getting 3 more players is the best way to go.) This game will take you awhile to beat since it's quite challenging and that leads into...\n\nThe CONS:...right here. While BAR looks and sounds like an arcade racer, it uses real car physics so part of the challenge comes to getting used to how it feels and controls. The cars you start out with are slow and rigid while the ones you unlock later on control much better. Also, the A.I. cars start off slow and don't pose a challenge but as you play through each difficulty level, they go faster, bump into you and rarely make a mistake so don't be surprised if you have to try again to finish in 1st place. This game is for those who want to put in time to unlock all the goodies here so if you want to pick up and play right away, you won't have access to the entire game from the get go.\n\nBeetle Adventure Racing is a great racer that while can be quite difficult at times, can be fun and is a good choice for those who like the San Francisco Rush and Cruis'n games.

But there are a few titles that absolutely require this upgrade. The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask and Donkey Kong 64 are two such titles for example, that cannot be accessed without this upgrade. Perfect Dark is one such title which offers minimal gameplay and locks players out of many of it's richer features due to the lack of available memory to run all of it's features properly. But I think you'll find that even if Donkey kong 64, Perfect dark, or Zelda Majora's Mask isn't your thing, you'll still be wanting to consider purchasing this Ram expansion for a few key reasons.\n\n1)Improved gameplay details. A lot of games weather you know this or not offer very fine gameplay oriented details not available without extended memory. Most games are capable of improved framerate (improves quality of onscreen action. Prevents slow down effects when a lot of on screen action is occuring for example.) Programers can implement more textures and details to environments and characters making things look more lively or life like. AI (artificial intelligence) can be improved and become \"smarter\".\n\n2) The second drastic improvement is audio/visual quality. Most people that don't understand how computer games really work or don't know all the technical terms, have a commen misconception that this expansion pak is supposed to improve the graphics in a way that might take the console beyond it's 64 bit capabilities. This isn't true. Rather, the expansion pak improves color quality and helps to reduce the blurry effect of the colors in most games, creating better visual clarity. Much of the blocky character sprites (but not all of course) will appear smooth and less blockish or choppy. With the improved framerate you may even notice how the environment in some games can pan out further while maintaining a smooth look, allowing the player to see further away from the character than they could with the jumper pak.\n\n...The memory expansion for N64 is relatively cheap now that the console itself is two generations removed behind Gamecube and Wii. And if your still into retro gaming or just enjoy playing the Nintendo 64 even after all these years I would certainly recommend this buy. Even if you never play the games which require the upgrade, I would consider this because of it's ability to enhance visual clarity. Couple the memory expansion up with a Video-S cable, and you will still find an appeal to the outdated graphics of a system of yore.", "summary": "A nice inexpensive way to enhance visual clarity on an aged console", "unixReviewTime": 1202169600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2007", "reviewerID": "A16RGMORD80K9V", "asin": "B00000INR2", "reviewerName": "Robert J.", "reviewText": "I have one of these for my N64 ( of course ) & it works just fine.\n\nTheres no dramatic increase in the screen graphics per se', but, due to having more memory to work with there is a more consistent 'Frame Per Second' flow, meaning that the games don't bog down when the screen graphics &/or action increase.\n\nAlso, Ive had no problem with the Expansion Pak, either with installation or operation. Its just a memory chip & while its vital to the operation of the game/system it isn't what I would call a \"working part\" thats going to damage anything. Im not saying it couldnt, just that its probably no more likely than a part you might buy directly from Nintendo.\nAnd there are some games that require the extra 4 mb of memory to access the full functionality of the game itself.\n\nIf you're going to play with the N64 system you should, IMO, try to get the most out of it. And while the added 4 mb of memory may not be required to play your favorite game, at this price, its still a worthy addition.\n\nSo you can spend $15 or more for a memory chip or $4 for a memory chip, but you are 99.9% likely to receive the same chip, just wrapped in a different box.", "summary": "Whats all the Hub Bub, Bub!?", "unixReviewTime": 1196380800}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2007", "reviewerID": "AZWKRO5BBSBEB", "asin": "B00000INR2", "reviewerName": "Didi", "reviewText": "It works like the one for the N64.

A few months ago I happened to come across a copy of Donkey Kong Land III for six dollars and made a point to snag it. I didn't get around to playing it for a while but when I did it really helped me out some unexpected ways.\n\nNow, I'm sure you're wondering how playing a video game can quote unquote \"help\" you. A few years ago I picked up a copy of the original Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo at the same store but when I played through it something felt a bit off. I just wasn't enjoying myself to the point I did when I played the game when I was younger. I wasn't sure if the problem was me or if it was the game... all I knew was I was going to have to play another game in the franchise (as a point of reference) to find out. Fast forward a few years when I got around to this and well, I had a blast. After completing Donkey Kong Land III I played a few more games like Donkey Kong Country 2 on the GameBoy Advance and the original Donkey Kong Land and those only solidified the weird fact that I don't like the first SNES game for some reason. Unfortunate (and bizarre) as that is I'm glad the whole series hasn't shared its fate.\n\nSince I've finished this game I've played the other two Land games and while the original Land is good despite its problems (2 is oddly disappointing for some reason...) I feel this is the strongest of the GameBoy games and considering how little it costs to procure this is just an excellent game to add to anyone's collection. However, as good as Donkey Kong Land III is - and how rewarding the unlockable time trial mode is - the sad fact is many people have completely forgotten about the Land series. In a certain sense this isn't surprising given that ports of the original Super Nintendo games were made available on the GameBoy Advance but it's shame that these games are being passed up.\n\nRegardless you can easily get about seven to eight hours of gameplay out of this one which is pretty impressive given today's second hand prices. If you're looking to introduce a younger gamer into gaming and want to do it with a less expensive system like the GameBoy Advance this is a great way to go.", "summary": "A very nice take on Donkey Kong Country 3, but...", "unixReviewTime": 1386028800}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2001", "reviewerID": "A1L2U1D24064GA", "asin": "B00000IXB8", "reviewerName": "Mo2Az", "reviewText": "This game is great!

As usual, they top expectations and deliver something  far beyond a merchandising tie-in.  This is a product which pushes the  boundaries of the racing genre. Take this feature-rich game out of the Star  Wars Universe and you still have a thrilling, easily-networkable ride.\nThe large number of different racers with different qualties is somewhat  _pro forma_ nowadays in the genre, but Lucasarts takes the idea one step  further.  By winning purses, you earn money with which to upgrade your  racer.  Thus there are a number of useful configurations which are only  possible through victory.\nThe number and quality of camera angles is  equally impressive.  In fact, the cockpit view is downright revolutionary.  From this vantage point, you feel the 400-mph+ speeds, and it's  comparatively harder in this camera to complete tricky courses.\nWhere the  game flags, I suppose, is in its surprising unfaithfulness to the film.  There's no ability to eliminate opposition by \"dirty tricks\", and  you can't disable the \"i-crashed-but-now-i-have-a-new-racer\"  feature.

First up is Team Sonic, which is Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails. Sonic is good for speed, Knuckles for power, and Tails for flying. Let me just say right now I HATE Tails's voice. Cream's and Charmy's too. Just because they're little kids doesn't mean they need to sound dumb. And how can Sonic be 8?! There is no way. I still think he's at LEAST 17.\n\nTeam Chaotix: By far my favorite team. I love Vector, he's so awesome. This team is more or less based on certain missions to do, not exactly getting through the stages. You have to find certain things, or defeat a certain number of enemies, or things like that. This team is for people who want something different. HATE Charmy's voice.\n\nTeam Dark: This is a team for more intermediate players. The levels are a bit longer, and the puzzles are more confusing. But still, it's a fun team to be. The voice acting for them are okay, I just wish Shadow sounded like he did in Shadow the Hedgehog.\n\nTeam Rose: HATE Cream's voice. These levels are easier and shorter, these are for beginning players and younger players as well. The levels are not hard to figure out, nor are they very long. If you want a challenge, I suggest trying Team Chaotix. I adore Big, but Amy is kind of stupid. The way she obsesses over Sonic is rather creepy, but whatever.\n\nAll in all, the game is great. I have been playing it and it is so cool. Keep in mind, it does get tiresome if you keep dying and have to start from the same checkpoint over and over, so be sure to hit the checkpoints.\n\nBy the way, Espio is a chameleon!\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\nGameplay: 10/10\n\nVoice acting--\n\nKnuckles--good\n\nSonic--good\n\nTails--HORRIBLE\n\nVector--good\n\nEspio--NICE\n\nCharmy--HORRIBLE\n\nAmy--ehh\n\nBig--okay\n\nCream---HORRIBLE\n\nShadow--ehh\n\nRouge--sounds a little like a man\n\nE-102 Omega--LOL\n\nGraphics: 10/10\n\nOverall score: 87/100", "summary": "SO FUN!!", "unixReviewTime": 1378598400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2013", "reviewerID": "A2RI3JEHBVQT9L", "asin": "B00000IZS1", "style": {"Platform:": " PlayStation2"}, "reviewerName": "PAPhillips", "reviewText": "GREAT PRICE EARLY DELIVERY, PRODUCT NEW AND FLAWLESS. . . and I bought it for a gift.

It's apparently a sequel to \"Sonic Adventure 2: Battle\" (though, I hardly see how), which I loved, but it wasn't as fun as I expected.  There are four teams with different stories and varying difficulties, but each team plays through the same levels in the same order.  The areas have a decent variety, but when you play through each four times, it gets boring.  There were sometimes changes to the levels, but not much.\nIn terms of gameplay, each team has three characters, and you can switch between which one you control.  One is a speed character, one is for flying, and one is better at attacking.  This is kind of fun, and it is mainly what makes the game unique.\nI also think the game could be too hard.  I don't mind a challenge, but the game could be too ridiculous at times.  It wasn't even fun many times because of this.  Once you practice a lot, it's not so bad, but it took a lot of practice to get good enough that the game finally became somewhat fun.  I believe there was a final story after the four main ones, which would have been nice to reach, but I couldn't get all the Chaos Emeralds, so I couldn't.  So try to get them as you go along, or you must redo levels.  Not much happened in the part of the story I actually got so see, and it could have been interesting, but I don't know.\nSo I really wouldn't suggest buying the game unless you really want to and really like Sonic games.

That will happen more than once to you.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game is the camera sometimes.

Lately I have been hearing people saying terrible things about this game, as well as other 3D Sonic platformers.  Here is my message for them: WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!  It's true that Sega hasn't exactly perfected the camera system for this game as well as the other Sonic 3D games, but please give Sega some credit for this good platformer.  To start with the good in this game, and there is a lot of it, the voice overs are totally sweet.  I normally don't pay much attention to the voices of the characters, as they little interest me, but this game struck a cord there.  Each voice, matches his or her corresponding character's personality, species, and gender perfectly!  There is no question about it.  The graphics are good, regardless of the very occasional jerky camera, and the video clips and the stories are also some of the best I have seen.  How each story begins, collides with other stories, and ends is masterpiece, and unlike many other games, once you finish a story, you can watch all of the movie clips of that story in the options menu!  The music totally rocks, especially the team themes, and the levels all have a good moral lesson for kids: that you need to work with others as a team!  Speaking of team, this game is very team oriented, the teams are:\n\nTeam Rose: which consists of Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit (and, as always, accompanied by Cheese the chao), and Big the Cat.  This team has adventures that are beginner difficulty.  This is good for young children, and getting beginners used to the game.  You may also enjoy this team's cuteness.\n\nTeam Sonic: this consists of Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles \"Tails\" Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna.  This team has a journey that is a little harder, normal difficulty to be exact.  This is good for those who want a little more of a challenge, and enjoy the light bantering of this somewhat humorous team.\n\nTeam Chaotix: the members of this group include Espio the Chameleon, Charmy the Bee, and Vector the Crocodile (who is apparently \"The Head Honcho\").  This team's adventures have been dubbed \"dubious\".  The difficulty, in my opinion, varies from easy to hard.  If you like detectives, mystery, and treasure hunting, this team is for you.  Most of their missions consist of finding a certain amount of something (five keys for example).  Not all of them, but most of them.  My last comment on them is: this is easily the most comical team in the game.  I have been set off laughing by a comment from these dudes several times.  You should have fun with them.\n\nTeam Dark: this team has Shadow the Hedgehog, Rouge the Bat, and Omega (who is an ex-eggman robot).  The mercenaries of this team are shrouded in mystery.  First off, I must comment that it's like a soap opera for children, that they brought Shadow back from his presumed death, and with amnesia included.  This team has hard difficulty, and often makes you go farther in the levels than you would normally have to with other teams.  This group would be extremely boring if it wasn't for Rouge.  Shadow and Omega take things very seriously, which makes Rouges role the person who lightens things up.  It's an interesting contrast of personalities.\n\nSo, like I stated earlier, I believe it is good for children to see teams of all kinds.  This basically teaches them you can team up with others, no matter how different they are, and work together on a task to make it easier.  Moving on, Sega also brings the special stages to 3D.  That's right, rather than collecting the emeralds in the storyline (like with the Sonic Adventure series) you actually have to collect a key, hightail it out of the level without getting hit, and complete a special stage in order to get a chaos emerald.  Oh, and true to form, the last special stage is once again the hardest.  There is also the \"Last Story\" that I will not go into detail here, but trust me, get all seven chaos emeralds and access it.  It is definitely worthwhile.  The only flaws I have to list for you is these:\n\n1.  Because of all of the team action, each individual lost something move wise.  I am talking about things like Knuckles' gliding and climbing abilities as well as Sonic's somersaulting.  Big no longer fishes like he did in Sonic Adventure, and the flight characters (Tails, Cream, Charmy, and Rouge) cannot fly as long or fast as they originally could.  Which sadly makes sense, seeing as those little things are carrying all of the weight of the rest of their teams.  Their cool team moves make up for most of the lost abilities, but you still have to miss Knuckles' climbing skills in those tight situations.\n\n2.  The flight members each have a special attack that they can do alone, but there is little point to them having it, seeing as they are almost never alone.  So your stuck just doing thundershoot.  While powerful, I do believe flying characters lack variety in their abilities.\n\n3.  The camera doesn't operate 100% smoothly.  It is slightly better than Sonic Adventure 2:Battle, and doesn't matter much anyway however.\n\n4.  There isn't enough variety in the chaotix missions.  It's always either find a certain amount of something, sneak past someone, or get from point A to point B before time runs out.  I guess it would be difficult to make it more than that, but still, the missions lack that \"investigative\" thing that detectives do.\n\n5.  There is no water to swim in.  This isn't exactly a huge problem, but I did enjoy confronting and swimming in bodies of water the other games throw at you.  Here, the only water you get is Seaside Hill and it behaves more like a bottomless pit.  It would have been interesting to see how each team adapted to a swimming pool, and maybe see what funny thing Sonic would have to say.\n\n6.  Finally, the zones are not as expansive.  It just puts you on one path and makes you go forward.  The advantage with this is that you can never get lost, but it loses that \"go wherever you want to\" charm.\n\nThat's it.  The 2 player mode is also great for those who are interested, and Omochao (a robotic chao) can colorfully guide you through the menus.  This game is well thought, well planned, and well designed.  There is even a zone for pinball fans in Casinopolis so this game has something for absolutely everyone.  GET THIS GAME!

Now, instead of just playing as one Hedgehog or one Echidna or one Bat or whatever, you have to employ teamwork across a cast of three characters per level in order to beat the game. There are 4 teams, so 12 playable characters in all - and range from Staples like Team Sonic (Sonic, Knuckles and Tails) to past characters (Rose the Bat, Big the Cat and Espiosa the... purple thing) to downright oddball characters (Charmy the Bee, for instance). On each team, one character is good for speed, one for strength and one for flying, and you do need to make good use of each character to beat the level you're currently playing. Also, the teams are graded in terms of difficulty, so beginners can start with Team Rose and work their way up, frustration-free.\nThis adds a huge sense of fun to the game, as well as keeping the Sonic concept fresh and exciting: hedgehog-runs-along-flat-plane is dull-dull-dull, but for the speed freaks the bonus levels are all about speed, and highly reminiscent of the Bonus Stages from Sonic 2. Similarly excellent is the presentation, as one would expect from a Sega game - there are a wealth of options to be unlocked, like new modes of play, the fabulous CG movies, different voices for the characters etc. - all of which makes for an excellent gaming experience.\nThoroughly recommended, this is another feather in Sega's cap and one of my personal favourite Sonic games to date.

I truly expected better for this game, since it was based on a truly cool, badass movie. The main reason why it wasn't so good is because of its difficulty... this game was incredibly difficult! Even with the Player's Guide it was very difficult to beat! The last time I played it was probably 2 to 3 years ago though, and back then I wasn't as skilled as I am now at video game playing... maybe I'll give it a second chance. Still, its chances of not being sold or something are not really good.\nAfter all the reviews that I read, I thought that when I tried my buddy's game \"Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles\" on my step-brother's Dreamcast that it would [stink]completely... but in fact it was the exact opposite. All the reviews I read kept saying how \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\" was way better than\"Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles\"... boy were those reviews experiencing strong cases of irony. \"Jedi Power Battles\" was a lot more fun than \"The Phantom Menace\", and it was at a good level of difficulty. Too bad I didn't beat it though, my step-brother doesn't have a Memory Card for his Dreamcast. If you're a HUGE fan of \"Star Wars\", then don't get this game... you'll end up destroying the game after you see how many pointless missions you have to go through and how many impossibly difficult leaders you have to face: 1) Jabba the Hut's champion fighter, 2) a huge and hairy beast, 3) a thief who stole a part from Anakin's podracer, 4) a Coruscant mercenary, 5) and ofcourse the incredibly powerful Darth Maul. Sure, it may SOUND easy, but wait till you hear this... you don't always play as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi; in quite a few levels you are forced to play as Captain Panaka and even...gulp...

I was twelve years old, in middle school, and the Pokemon games debuted in the United States for the very first time.  A game so simple and yet at the very same time: So complex.  Nothing was more addictive, nothing was more fun than playing Pokemon.  If you remember the craze (the REAL craze, presently it isn't nearly as strong as it was back then), then you remember what it was like to go to school back in those days.  Suddenly EVERYONE had a Gameboy.  Suddenly even those who didn't normally play games or even know what the hell a Gameboy was, had it.  And you'd go up to your friends and you'd trade Pokemon, you'd taunt each other about who was the better champion when you battled.  You got in arguments over who the best starter was.  Then you learned of those glitches to get all your Pokemon to level 100 by duplicating the Rare Candies.  You caught Missingno and M-Block and caught Safari Zone Pokemon by exploiting what may very well be one of the most widely known glitches in video game history.  And of course, you went to catch them all, and you probably had that ONE friend who you deemed your rival and you had to catch 'em all before he did.  If you remember all this, you're a true Pokemon fan.  This isn't a myth, this game debuted, sold gazillions of copies and started a craze that--while it isn't as strong--still exists today.  This was one of the heights of gaming period.\n\nThe Red and Blue versions may have seen stateside release in 1998, but the game was actually made in 1995.  Before the television show came around.  When the TV series took off in America, the games came next and as I said, they sold more copies than the latest installment of Harry Potter.  I'm not kidding.\n\nRed and Blue began almost everything you currently see in the series today.  The game begins with you naming your character (you couldn't choose between a boy or a girl in this one) and then your rival.  Again, if you had Pokemon fever you probably named your main character Ash and your rival was named Gary (even the strategy guides referred to them as such).  It began with Professor Oak letting you have a Pokemon of your choice (between 3 starters) and then ultimately he'd send you on a journey with a Pokedex and have you document the Pokemon you'd find.  Along the way, you'd have to deal with Team Rocket, the bad guys who are always causing trouble and stealing everyone's Pokemon, as well as gather eight badges so you could challenge the Elite Four and become a Pokemon League Champion.  The entire formula began here, and just about everything mentioned above has been done in each and every main series Pokemon game hereafter.\n\nWhat was perhaps the strangest thing about Pokemon is that the game was surprisingly deep in terms of combat.  It was your traditional turn-based combat.  Simple, yet it was so complex.  For one, the game has a Rock/Paper/Scissors method to it.  Every Pokemon has a type, and every type has its own strengths and weaknesses.  For example, Water is strong up against fire but it is weak vs. Grass.  Grass is weak vs. fire etc. etc.  No Pokemon is invincible.  They all have a weakness to some type.  Though in these versions the psychics definitely have an unfair advantage as the type they're weak against (bug) is almost non-existent and there are hardly any bug type attacks.\n\nIn the battle menu you're given a list of commands.  Fight, Item, PKMN, or Run.  You can switch Pokemon you've caught in and out of battle on the fly, but it'll usually cost you a turn.  It's the strategic portion of Pokemon that makes battling fun and addictive.  As you go through the game you'll be challenged by trainers and you never know what they'll throw at you!  It's completely unpredictable and some of them are tough.  It's also interesting because with 150 different Pokemon, the amount of teams you can make are endless, and it really makes you think about what types you want in your roster.  Because most of the Pokemon types are weak vs. more than just one type.  It's also important that you give them a variety of moves, as the moves are also typed.  On paper it doesn't seem like much, but when you actually play the game, you'll find a clog in your drain you didn't even know you had because you thought your team was perfect... but then that one Pokemon comes along and exposes your fatal flaw.\n\nPokemon was no short game.  It was full of all sorts of side quests.  From the Safari Zone, to catching the Legendary Birds, to the Unknown Dungeon.  There was plenty to do, and even after the game was over there was STILL more to accomplish.  Of course, your main accomplishment was getting them all.  Pokemon could easily keep you busy for well over 60 hours.  In 1998 this is an amazing feat seeing as how most RPGs of TODAY don't keep you busy that long.  The main quest itself only took a measly 15 hours or so, but all the extra content kept you on your toes.\n\nEven more, Pokemon was one of the few Gameboy Games that made excellent use of the link cable.  Since Red and Blue versions had different Pokemon, some only appeared in certain versions.  You couldn't for example, catch a Magmar in the Red version, but you could in Blue.  How then, were Red players supposed to catch all 150?  By trading.  Until Pokemon came around, my link cable was collecting dust.  Trading was usually a slow grueling process, though.  Traded Pokemon also got an experience boost so they were easier to train.\n\nEven more exciting than trading, however, was what really made Pokemon a blast to play: Battling.  You and your friends could get together and battle one another!  Test out your Pokemon teams against your friends.  They were, more often not, far better to battle against than the games trainers.  It's always interesting to see who your opponents heavy hitter is.  With your friends it was always interesting.  Imagine how embarrassed you were to say a certain Pokemon sucked only to discover that the trainer actually did a good job training?\n\nAs far as the game looks and sounds, it didn't really look all that great when it was released in 1998 (it was after all, a game made in 1995).  On the original gameboy it was pretty grainy (but very clear on the Gameboy Pocket) and of course it was black or white (unless you played it on a Super Gameboy or Gameboy Color).  For a Gameboy game, though, it actually wasn't too bad.  It was annoying to watch a Pokemon simply flinch to attack, and some of the animations weren't all that great, but it was to be expected due to the Gameboy's limitations.  The music, however, was fantastic.  The tunes were catchy--particularly the trainer battles and gym leader battles.  The only really annoying thing was the sound effects.  They weren't all that great, and its a shame that Nintendo actually continues to use those exact same sound effects in Pokemon games today.  Still, for what it's worth, this was the game you wanted on the Gameboy.\n\nPokemon is a classic.  It'll always be a classic.  No matter who you are, if you played Pokemon ten years ago, the craze was completely undeniable.  If you got addicted like I did, chances are you're still playing today.  Because in its core, the game was far deeper than you thought it was, and the series continues to use that same basic formula even today.", "summary": "This is Where It All Began", "unixReviewTime": 1177977600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "5", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2006", "reviewerID": "A21ZR0J50M644P", "asin": "B00000IYEQ", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Kathy L.

The actual goal was as many Tootsie Roll wrappers we each got, that was how many Tootsie Rolls we would get. Anyway, I found a stray Ponyta Pokemon Card in one part of the yard, and my friend found a Dark Charmeleon. My friend said, \"I'll trade you my Dark Charmeleon for your Ponyta if you want\". Well, personally, I didn't want to, I wanted to add this card and start a collection, but my friend's Dark Charmeleon did look sort of cool at the time. I finally gave in and said, \"well, why not?\" So we traded. A few days later, we started acting out some of the episodes at recess (I'd never seen the episodes at the time). My friend was basically making up his own little stories... never mind the episodes that were on TV. Later on, my liking for Pokemon grew when my friend decided to bring his Game Boy Color to school, AND his Pokemon Red Version. I thought to myself, hmmm... this could be interesting. I asked him what he was playing and if I could watch him play it. he said, \"sure you can watch.\" I didn't get to see much of the game because we weren't outside for recess that long. Then, I decided I wanted to get my own version of Pokemon Red. I asked my mom and she said I could. So I did. I got the game (almost 7 years later and I still haven't beaten it) and I ended up loving it. So, in conclusion, I'm eighteen and a half years old, a junior at Grafton High School, and I still love Pokemon (the games more than the episodes), but one thing has changed... my friend and I don't do \"reenactments\" of our favorite episodes anymore like we used to.

The premise of Pokemon -to collect and train pokemon - was the perfect fertile growing field to exploit this fascination children had with collecting things. The first exploit was the TV show, where the characters in the videogame were rendered onto the TV screen. When that became popular enough, the creators rendered the full 150 Pokemon into thousands of different incarnations. Pokemon T-shirts, teddybears, actionfigures, trading cards, stickers, watches etc were all created under the slogan: 'you've gotta catch 'em all'... Parents had a rotten time, that's for sure. And it was this capitalistic, persistent, and continuous explotation of the pokemon name which made the name synonymous with childrens toys. The pokemon legacy was ruined by this exploitation, and the videgame was largely discredited as a childrens fad. But before the TV show, the toys, the trading cards, etc..the game stood pure and unspoilt by the impending pokemon-craze which was about to accompany it. Everybody loved the game. Pokemon was revered.\n\nIn the game you play as Ash, whose one single ambition is to become the greatest Pokemon trainer in the world. To do so you must collect pokemon and train them in battle.  To catch Pokemon you need to engage in combat with wild Pokemon (wild animals). You choose which of your Pokemon is suitable for the fight and deminish the wild pokemon's strengh little by little untill it becomes weak enough to be captured. Once caught, the wild pokemon will become loyal and obedient. There's no 'set in stone' rule when it comes to catching Pokemon, if you fancy the look of a Pokemon, then you capture it.  Wild Pokemon are scattered throughout the game and you can catch them at any time.\n\nTo complete the game, you must collect all eight gym badges. Gym badges are given to those who defeat gym owners. Gym owners are professional Pokemon trainers who are hardened by battle experience, and thus, much harder to defeat than normal Pokemon trainers. It takes a long time to collect the badges, because the gyms are sporodically spread throughout the game.  Between collecting badges and training Pokemon, you will encounter many RPG elements in the game, puzzles, dungeons, items, etc...  The game is huge and difficult and can take over 25 hours to complete. It certainly exceeds the expectations of a game merely designed to kill time on a long coach trip, which was what the GB was created for in the first place. Taking into account that the GB is a very primitive console, the kind of experience Pokemon offers exceeds all prior benchmarks in handheld gaming. It's an edifying experience.\n\nNot only is it the best GB game, it is one of the best overall games ever.", "summary": "Best of Gameboy", "unixReviewTime": 1117756800}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2005", "reviewerID": "A3G44HT4IDEC4E", "asin": "B00000IYEQ", "style": {"Format:": " Video Game"}, "reviewerName": "Videogamer1416", "reviewText": "This is a great classic game.  You begin as a new Pokemon trainer, and soon select your first Pokemon.  The choices are Charmander, a fire type;squirtle, a water type;or bulbasaur, a fire type.  Interestingly, three Pokemon you choose from are like rock/paper/scissors, charmander beats bulbasaur, squirtle beats charmander, and bulbasaur beats squirtle.  Soon, you rival chooses his Pokemon(annoyingly, its always the one that has the type advantage, like if you choose squirtle he will choose charmander.  You are then given the task of completing a complete guide of Pokemon by catching all of them.  In order to beat the game, you only need the first 150 Pokemon, however, there is also a legendary number 151 Mew.  You catch Pokemon by using one you already have to weaken it, then catching it with a Pokeball.  Once you catch a Pokemon, you may use it to fight others, but you can only have up to 6 Pokemon at a time.  Along the way, you will encounter other trainers you may battle.  There are regular trainers, which you battle only for money, fun, and experience.  However, there are also gym leaders, which are specialized trainers with stronger Pokemon than regular trainers in their area have.  There are 8 in all, and once you beat them, you may then battle the elite four, who are much tougher than gym leaders and you have to fight all of them in succession.  You also encounter your rival throughout the game.  And he becomes Pokemon League Champion, however, once you defeat him, you become Pokemon League Champion.  There are also troublemaking team rocket members that you can and sometimes have to battle as well.  Their boss is also the leader of gym 8.  I have found the gym leaders and team rocket members are actually exceedingly easy if you know what you're doing, however, the elite 4 is very tough, especially since you have to face them all toghether.  There are also legendary Pokemon, which are considered to be part of the 151 total, and they are very rewarding but challenging to catch.  Also, one cool thing is there is a lot of moves(although some are kind of stupid) and certain Pokemon have strengths over others.  For example, fire takes out grass easily.  However, you can beat the game just by having stronger Pokemon, however, this is actually harder than using strategy.  Because it takes a great length of time to level up, while a skilled player can quickly catch a Pokemon with a type advantage.  And to the guy who said he beat this game in a hour....if you think this game is easy, than you should quit playing videogames altoghether, because you obviously are such a great master of everything.  Also, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT THE GAME IN A HOUR!  AT MINIMUM, YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT FOR AT LEAST LIKE 20 HOURS FOR YOUR POKEMON TO BE HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL TOO!  Oh, wait, you must have used a gameshark.  Wow, no wonder you are so good at videogames.  But if anyone tells you they beat the game in a hour, they either cheated, found a big glitch, or both.  Or else their exaggerating.  But the only way the game could really beat that easy is if you had a strategy guide.  \"Oh this game is so easy, I only had to read 50 books on it to beat it on the first try.\"  GET REAL!  IF THIS ISN'T A CHALLENGE, NOTHING IS!  Overall, its a great game, but there are some annoying things.  First off, to get all 151, you must trade with freinds, as neither red nor blue has every Pokemon, but they do combined.  Most Pokemon are in both versions, but some are exclusive to either red or blue.  Also, as you level up your Pokemon, they evolve(which is really more accurately described as metamorphises), and some only evolve by trading them with the same Pokemon with another player.  Another thing is there is only one save slot. Finally, in the Japenese version, by getting the first 150, you get number 151,but in the US version you can only get them through Nintendo's promotions or by cheating.  Hmm, giving Americans a raw deal, aye Nintendo?  You know we buy into your promotions instead of demanding that you make stuff available in the games.  In Japan, gamers would be outraged, but you know you can take advantage of us Americans?  Okay, go ahead.

Everyone will love this game.\nYou start out as a trainer named Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town. Your mission is to become a Pokmon Master by catching 150 Pokmon (151 if you count Mew) and becoming the champion of the Elite Four. To do this, you must train and catch Pokmon, raise them, and even trade them between Red and Blue versions using your Link Cable or the infrared port on your Game Boy Color.

Raising Pokmon may sound tedious, but you will change your mind about that when you actually play for yourself. Pokmon is addictive from the moment you start your game all the way through. You will meet many new people on the way, become a hero, and win new items and abilities as you go along.\nAs Ash, you travel through the world of Kanto, which is divided into a number of cities and towns. A map will be your guide as you make your way through the vast world of Pokmon. Explore caves, oceans, tall grass, and rocky paths on your way. Each town or city usually has its own Pokmon Gym, with a Gym Leader which is something like a Boss. Each time you beat a Gym Leader you receive a badge. You need eight badges to battle the Elite Four and the current Elite Four Champion. There are different diversions in each city and town, for example, Celadon City's department store and casino, and one of my personal favorites, Fuschia City's Safari Zone.\nTrainers can be found everywhere, good and bad, from Team Rocket invading the radio station, to the gyms, in the water, on the road, and pretty much anywhere you go. Random Pokmon appear and battle you if you are in a cave, tall grass, or in the water. The wild Pokmon you come across are the ones that you can catch if you have Pokballs with you. Items such as the bike and repel can help prevent you from running into too many Pokmon if you are trying to get somewhere. If your Pokmon are tired or injured, you can stop at a Pokmon center and heal them for free! You can also store Pokmon via a computer terminal located within every Pokmon Center.\nThe music is so cute! And there is a lot of different music, so it doesn't get repetitive.\nIf you are lucky enough to own Pokmon Stadium, you can play Red or Blue on your TV screen using a Transfer Pak! You can also use the Pokmon you raised on your Red or Blue game to battle in Pokmon Stadium.\nOverall, this is one of the best games I have ever played. It is still fun after years of gameplay, as you never fully run out of stuff to do. If you want to get into Pokmon, or if you're an old fan that never quite got around to getting the game, this is the game for you!

I was not regretting it when I asked for it and got it for Christmas, because this game was so cool at first. On Christmas day of 1998, I must have played this game all day. In three days, I had all eight badges, and enough to take on the Elite Four. It took me a little while to beat them, I did. And that's when I got sick of the game. The thing is, after you beat the Elite Four, what you have is a group of superpowerful Pokemon that can only fight wild Pokemon, and you need to catch the rest of the Pokemon. The game becomes a big nothing. It's fun to raise low level Pokemon if you still have trainers you haven't fought, but besides that, it's a pretty big nothing. All you can really do is fight wild Pokemon, walk around, get lost(Which is hard because the game's map is too easy to figure out), and go shopping for items you probably won't need. I have never gotten all 151 Pokemon, because it gets so boring at around 120 that I can't stand it. The game is fun if you use cheats like starting off with Mew and multiplying items, but besides that, it's pretty boring. I'd say to buy it, but the fad is over now, and nobody cares. Playing Pokemon these days makes you an outcast. Only buy this if you're not afraid of ruining whatever reputation you have.\nPS: Don't say my review was helpful just because you're an angry fan.

You can find poke balls to throw at other opponents, or swords and bats you can use to hit other people. It's a really fun game to play with people your own age, and its what I think to be one of the more entertaining games on the Nintendo 64.\n\n The only cons I can really say about this game are that the creators didn't include enough of our beloved Nintendo characters.

There's even a new level (Mushroom Kingdom Classic.) I hope it helps you :)\n\n[EDIT] Here I was nice enough to post everything for you:\n\nCheat: 999%\nThere are two ways to to do this, you must pick Mario as your character and you must go to Hyrule Castle as a stage (you can fight any opponent you want). At Hyrule Castle, get your chosen opponent to the top wooden platform, and then push him or her off of the platform on the left side. Then, spawn as many green shells as you can on the right side of the platform. From here, go to the middle platform and go to the edge of the left side, facing left. Do Mario's Up + B move - if done correctly, your opponent's percentage will go up to 999%. Then, simply wait a second, and knock your opponent off the screen. The other way that takes longer, but is easier. Just select any chracter that shoots projectiles, like mario, luigi, and fox then keep hurting your opponent at the practice level of any selection until they get 999% and after hit the opponent and see them fly like a missle.\n\nUnlockable: Mushroom Kingdom\nTo unlock the Mushroom Kingdom beat the game with all eight original characters. This will open up a level that resembles an old-school Super Mario Bros. level.\n\nChange Outfits:\nYou can change your character's outfits by tapping the four C Buttons at the character select screen. Some costume changes are limited to colors, but characters like Pikachu are also available with a hat.\n\nUnlockable Luigi:\nTo play as Luigi, pass the Bonus Practice 1 with at least 8 main characters like the ones you didn't have to unlock. When Luigi challenges you, defeat him and he's yours.\n\nKirby's Power Loss:\nEverybody knows that Kirby can swallow his opponents and take on some of their powers in this game, but what if you accidentally \"ate\" a character you didn't want -- and you want to pursue someone else? Simple: Just press the L Button to pull of Kirby's \"Hello!\" taunt and he will discard whatever power he took on.\n\nJigglypuff\nIf you want to get the Pokemon Jigglypuff all you have to do is beat the game one time and then you will face JigglyPuff in a battle. If you beat JigglyPuff you will be able to use her in the game.\n\nUnlockable: Item Switch Menu\nTo unlock the Item menu (where players determine weapons and their frequency), play Vs. mode at least 50 times.\n\nUnlockable: Captain Falcon\nTo play as Captain Falcon, you must beat the game on any difficulty with however many lives in UNDER 20 MINUTES. After that Captain Falcon will challenge you. Once you beat him, you be able to select Captain Falcon as a character.\n\nUnlockakle: Ness\nTo play as Ness, beat the one-player mode with any character, with the number of starting lives set to 3 and the difficulty set to NORMAL. You must beat the game without continuing.\n\nUnlockable: Sound Test\nTo activate the Sound Test, successfully complete Bonus Practice games 1 and 2 with all characters  including the hidden ones. The Test Music option will appear on the Data screen.\n\nQuick Recovery:\nHave you ever been hit so far you haven't been able to get back into the game to help your buddies? After being hit into the air, tap Z as soon as you hit the ground. When you hit the ground, you will spring up from the ground quickly, and you can be back in the game faster. Also, you can press forward or backward to roll after you have sprung back into play.\n\nRotate Characters:\nYou can rotate and view the characters from different angles by entering the character bio section and holding Z.

It doesn't even skip on the moves. You can throw Link's boomerang, Samus Aran's morphing ball bombs, Mario's fireballs, Jigglypuff's sing, and many other characters moves. The graphics for the game were excellent at the time and still look better than any N64 game except Mario 64.\n\nNot only do you have every characters special moves is that almost everybody has their own level and music from their game. You can fight on a Pokemon Center, the Great Fox, Brinstar Depths, or in Dreamland to name a few levels. The only characters that don't have their own level or share one with another character are Ness, Captain Falcon, Jigglypuff, and Luigi. It also has weapons from each characters game. The Bo-ombs, Ray Guns, Poke Balls, Hammers, and others.

You have to beat the game with everyone which makes you appreciate each character's strength and weaknesses. Yoshi doesn't have a triple jump so you have to play to that weakness while Kirby has about 7 jumps which a strength. You have to learn to take advantage of your enemies weaknesses. If you see Samus charging up be ready to reflect it back with Fox.\n\nThe best thing about this game is that you have to unlock half the things yourself. You have to unlock characters and levels. It is fun, especially since the single-player is great fun.\n\nWhat do you do after you unlock everything? Play multiplayer mode of course which is the best part of the game. You and up to 3 friends or AI duke it out in a free-for-all. Don't like playing by yourself, you can set it to teams with up to 3 teams(red, green, or blue) and fight that way.

Damage to you or to your opponent builds up as you hit him/her.  Some punches or moves give more damage than others and as the damaged builds up, the character turns more vulnerable to being knocked off.\nThere are a few moves that only give damage and other moves are used to specifically knock off your opponent.  This means that you cannot just push buttons at random, it requires a lot of patience and some reflexes to defeat your adversary consistently.\nThe game is extremely simple to learn, yet there are quite a large amount of special moves to master.

In single player mode, you fight computer controlled characters on many different stages. You earn points based on how well you do (ie how fast you defeat all the enemies) and what you do (ie using the same move the whole stage). Eventually you can fight the master hand, boss of the last stage. Once you beat him, you have the opportinity to unlock hidden characters, Luigi (Mario), Jigglypuff(Pokemon), Ness(EarthBound), and Captain Falcon(FZero Racing). You also try for the highest score.\n  Multiplayer can be more fun. You basically go through a skirmish against 1 to 3 other players, whether controlled by the computer or a human. The items will apply, and you can turn them on or off by playing 50 multiplayer games and unlocking the item switch. After you end the time limit with more points than all other players / if everyone else is out of lives, you get ranked 1st 2nd 3rd or 4th, and the stats of the game are sent into the game stats bank, which you can look over.\n  You can also practice some of the stages of the game, trying for the best time. If you persist in this, you can unlock luigi. It is always good to get practice.\n  Overall, this game deserves a more than five stars. It is very fun, and it provides endless entertainment.", "summary": "Comical and Chaotic", "unixReviewTime": 994636800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2001", "reviewerID": "A1SF5QI677TQYK", "asin": "B00000J2W7", "reviewerName": "Jason Anderson", "reviewText": "This Game is Awsome...purely...AWSOME!!!!

Instead, in this game, there are about nine moves, most of them useless because they do so little damage. This alone makes this game so incredibly boring after two hours that I have to wonder what the creators were thinking when they made this game. Even multiplayer mode loses its appeal pretty quickly, because of the limited amount of moves. There are also a few too many items, and it really makes it less fair that you can use a big baseball bat or a lightsaber or a beamgun to help you win. Also, considering that the gameplay wasn't good enough, the fighting environment takes a new approach at trying to add lots of detail and affecting play, but most of the battle grounds are far too plain for what it is trying to attempt. But I will say that the game has incredible graphics, each character and scene developed beautifully. I also like that in practice mode, you can change the speed of the characters movement so it seems like slow motion. You can make the characters go at normal speed, or one-fourth of it, making for a great amount of Matrix-like suspense. The two challenge rounds are also a challenge, maybe too great a challenge, especially with characters like Yoshi, who don't get a jumping boost, but an egg to throw. The bottom line is, this game is simply a rental, because that is about the amount of time it will take you to get sick of this game.

Super Mario Bros. Deluxe features not only the 1985 NES original levels, but also the Japanese version levels that North American players couldn't have before.  At that particular time, the only other way that anyone could access those levels was to play Super Mario All Stars for the Super NES/Nintendo Wii.  However, the NES Japanese levels were finally included on this 1999 Game Boy Color port/remake.  (For those of you history buffs, the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. was actually named Super Mario Bros. 2.  The North American version of SMB2 was completely different and released in 1988 with Wart as the main archvillain, not Bowser.)\n\nI actually find the Japanese version of the levels very satisfying and much more challenging.  Some unusual effects will happen, such as Mario/Luigi jumping off a trampoline and into the air off screen for a couple of seconds, entering a \"negative\" warp pipe that brings you back several worlds (i.e., instead of going FORWARD), or seeing Goombas walking in the water levels.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. Deluxe is one of those games that I could NEVER ever quit playing, even if I wanted to.  So stop reading this already and get this game!! Sadly, Super Mario Bros.

Boo mode where you race against a ghost through some of the game stages, a 2 player VS mode where you and another place race against each other (connected via the cable link), a Challenge mode where for each stage you have to find 5 red coins, a Yoshi egg and beat the high score. There's also extra content like the ability to print images from the GB printer (sold separately), a program that tells you where the Yoshi eggs are hidden, a built in calendar and a fortune teller program.\n\nThe CONS: None.\n\nIt's a must own title back then and a real treat to play nowadays if you still have the Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance SP.

What you haven't played are the new modes injected in the Game Boy Color version. The Vs. Mode requires two Game Boy Colors and a link-cable, but this game is a whole lot of fun. It's a race to the flag pole between Mario and Luigi, and you'll try to screw each other up by hitting triggers that will put blocks up in the way. Very cool use of the original Super Mario Bros. engine, and worth the purchase of another cartridge just for this feature alone. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe also has a Challenge Mode, where you'll have to find five red coins and a Yoshi egg, as well as beat the level's preset score to finish the level completely. This is pretty darn difficult, hope you have a lot of patience. When I say pixel-perfect, I mean it. Even though the Game Boy Color screen has less resolution than a standard television, the developers have translated the same pixel count for every object in the game, from Mario to the koopas, turtles, even the question-mark blocks. Granted, this reduces the screen visibility somewhat, but the developers have added user-controlled screen-scrolling to the mix. If you want to see above or below where you're standing, it's all a matter of pushing up or down on the pad. All 32 levels, from 1-1 to 8-4 are patterned after the levels in the NES classic. Nothing's changed. Well, that's not exactly true, you can now save your game in progress, something you could not do in the original. It also remembers which levels you've completed, and unlocks secrets based on how many you've finished. So it's not always a good thing to find the warp zones so early in the game. Secrets? That's right. As you complete certain tasks in the game, you open up little hidden trinkets. Things like a Photo Album where you can print out earned pictures on your Game Boy Printer, or a Toy Box where you can make messages and print them out. Oh, and just because they could, the developers stuck in a fortune teller (just think \"Mario Magic 8 Ball\") and a calendar option where you can enter important dates and save them to a cartridge. Do they need to be in there? Of course not. But they're cool additions nontheless. Super Mario Bros. remains one of my top 10 favorite games of all-time, even though it's almost a decade and a half old. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is such a perfect translation, it makes me wonder if it's easy to port NES games to the Game Boy Advance. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is the Game Boy Color-specific game to own, hands down, and will be the title that, hopefully, will key a revolution of porting NES games to the handheld system. Buy this game.

It doesn't quite capture the magic many of us old school gamers can remember the first time we saw that screen on our TVs.  But the Golden Age of the video gaming industry has passed, and we must continue on.  Sorry for getting nostalgic, but there's still nothing quite as memorable these days as playing the old NES years ago, with a lot of friends gathered around.  Perhaps I romantize that era to much of the video game industry, but I have a lot of good memories from that.  That's how boys bond (and also men - me and my best friends still go and play the N64 --- the latest wrestling game from THQ and Goldeneye always come in handy).  And for those parents who are concerned with some of the more mature elements in gaming these days - don't worry, Mario doesn't have anything to be concerned about.\nAnyway, this includes some new features, like challenges (find Yoshi's Egg, 5 red coins, and beat a specified high score), races with Boo, a Toy Box (or something along those lines), and some trophies.  Also, more intriguing, is that that included the Japanese SMB II or Lost Levels for us American and UK folks or gamers I mean.  You have to get 300,000 points on the original, and then Luigi's head will appear on the gaming menu.  Its retitled SUPER MARIO BROTHERS FOR SUPER PLAYERS, and you have to be one to beat it, the difficulty level is so high.  It took us a good 13 years to get the game in original 8 bit format.  One thing about the screen: its not big enough to get the entire game inside it, so they have Mario look up and down.\nAll in all, a good adaptation.  Still, it'd be nice to see the release of more games like this -- mainly the first two LEGEND OF ZELDA games on one cart.  Why don't they do this??  Perhaps with the release of the two new GB Colour Zelda games (they divided one game into halves and stuck it on the remaining two) we'll see a release of those two classic Zelda titles.

First off, the graphics are marvelous, and proves that GBC is just as good as the NES, if not better. Another thing good about this game is the new save system(I knew it was new because I had a friend who had the original for the NES). They also installed a new challenge mode which is very tough, but later in the game, there is a new item in the Toy Box that gives hints to where all the Yoshi Eggs are. The Toy Box has options like Fortune telling which can be very amusing(And get you five more lives to start with if you get an Extremely Lucky card) and tons of printouts for the Game Boy Printer. You might also want to have a Link Cable and a friend with this game handy for the Vs. Mode. In this mode, you can race your opponent on the special race courses. You can also play this mode in one-player, with Boo as your opponent. There is also a new Photo Gallery, which takes a picture every time you do something new, like stomp a new enemy, or trade high scores with a friend with the Infared sensor. Yes, I said high scores, another new feature. But this is all aside from the main game. The game isn't really too challenging until the last world, but I noticed that you can jump higher in this game than any other 2D Mario adventure I've played so far. Once you beat the main game, you get the Star levels, which are a little more challenging anyway. And once you get the high score, you can get to the Lost Levels, which are EXTREMELY hard, and the last of them has TWO Bowsers!

Then I got this. My mind was blown. I had no idea color existed. As soon as I turned on Pokemon Yellow and saw Pikachu. I looked around and saw a whole new world. One with color. I mean yes. I did notice color before in the real world. But I just called it life. Because of this I know that life is in color! But wait a minute? The Gameboy was in color too right? Green is a color. Grey is a color. Black is a color. I was so confused. What is the difference between this color and that color? This one does have a more wide of a variety of colors. But the old one still had a few colors so... this is the Gameboy with more Color.\n\nAll joking aside, this a nice handheld console. Most people think of this as the very first color handheld console. But it wasn't. The first was actually the Atari Lynx(1989). This was released in 1998. Between them a few other color handheld gaming consoles existed. But this was the first color Nintendo handheld console! Which as you probably know Nintendo dominates the handheld market. The Gameboy color seems to be forgotten in past years because of the Advance's backwards compatibility. I don't know why though. This console should be trendy and hip. Think about it. It has a nice and colorful shell. It is nice to hold, and easy to carry around. Also it seems that a ton of parents skipped buying this for there kids because it was just a Gameboy with some color. So hear time and time again that this is the console they have always wanted to own. But never have.  So here are some reasons why you should own one even if you have an advance or SP.\n\n1. More light with color. As I stated in the first satirical paragraph, this console is in color. So Your probably thinking, so my advance is in color as well. But the advances screen is impossible to see without a light right behind you. While this isn't backlight either this is easier to see. Much easier to see. why? Because this is vertical instead of horizontal. Which catches more light from the sides because of the higher surface area.  This is very hard to explain in Ascii. But let me try. Let the <>=light. And let the {}=Gamboy color. And let the equal sign = Gameboy Advance. So here is the demonstration.\n\n  >  <\n  >=<\n  >  <\n\n  >  <\n  >{}<\n  >  <\n\nSee. With more light to catch it makes it easier to see.\n\n2. Colorful shell variation. One thing I am going to make clear right here. I am reviewing the Gameboy Color as a whole. Not just the Teal variation. I do own the Teal variation so that is why this review is being posted here. There are so many different types of Gameboy Colors out there.  (From Wikipedia) here are all the variations out there of the Gameboy Color.\n\nBasic colors\n\nGrape - purple (1998)\nTeal (1998)\nKiwi - light green (1998)\nBerry - fuchsia (1998)\nDandelion - yellow (1998)\nAtomic Purple - clear purple (1998)\nNeotones Ice - clear (NIS 1998)\n\nLimited Edition colors\n\nClear Black (2000, Japan)\nClear Green (Toys 'R' Us, Japan, 2000)\nMidnight Blue (Toys 'R' Us, Japan, 1999)\nIce Blue (Toys 'R' Us, Japan)\nClear Orange (Daiei, Japan, 1999)\nClear Blue (ANA)\nGreen 'n' Gold Australian Edition\n\nSpecial Edition variants\n\nMirinda - clear orange w/ logo\nYedigun - clear orange w/ logo (Turkey, 2000)\nNeotones - clear green and yellow w/ Aussie flag & yellow buttons (Australia)\nTommy Hilfiger - yellow w/ logo (US)\nTsutaya - water blue w/ orange buttons (Japan, 2000)\nSakura Taisen - clear pink (2000)\nHello Kitty Special Box - light pink w/ logo (Japan, 1999)\nHello Kitty Special Box 2 - light pink w/ logo (Japan, 2000)\nLawson - Aqua Blue & Milky White (1999)\nTakarazuka - atomic gold w/ aquatic life artwork (Japan, 1999)\nJasco - clear purple w/ Mario artwork (1999)\nJasco - clear w/ Mario artwork (1999)\nCardcaptor Sakura - white & pink w/ artwork (Japan, 1999)\nSwedish - blue & yellow (limited to 3000 units)\nFerrero SpA competition - yellow w/ Happy Hippo Logo & Happy Hippo Character \"Max Mutig\"(came bundled with the game \"Das Geheimnes der Happy Hippo Insel\")(limited to 111 units) (Germany,2001)\n\nImagine having all of those on a display. That would be one nice piece of artwork. If I had the funds I would have a shelf that goes around a room with all of those displayed.\n\n3. In my opinion this is the funnest Gameboy. This Console has a certain personality that other console just don't have. It is the fun loving console happy go getting console. If your goth. I don't recommend it. I always play this thing. This is my GOTO Gameboy. (Basic joke). If you don't get you are much cooler than I am. But hey it's that kind of console. Yes there are better options to play the same games. But I keep grabbing this.\n\n4. Easy to hold. This is a very comfortable system. I can play this for hours. I cannot do that with a Gameboy or a Gameboy Advance.\n\n5. A must own for any Nintendo lover. This is Nintendo in a box. Fun, Goofy, and awesome.\n\n6. Very easy to hack. If you can solder you can do many things with this.\n\nTechnical Specs again from Wikipedia,\n\nMain processor: Sharp Corporation LR35902 (based on the popular Zilog Z80, 8-bit)\nProcessor speed: 4 or 8 MHz (two processor modes)\nResolution: 160 x 144 pixels (same as the original Game Boy)\nPalette colors available: 32,768 (15-bit)\nColors on screen: Supports 10, 32 or 56\nMaximum sprites: 40 total, 10 per line, 4 colors per sprite (one of which being transparent)\nSprite size: 8x8 or 8x16\nTiles on screen: 512 (360~399 visible, the rest are drawn off screen as a scrolling buffer)\nAudio: 2 square wave channels, 1 wave channel, 1 noise channel, mono speaker, stereo headphone jack\nROM: 8 MB maximum\nRAM: 32 kB\nVRAM: 16 kB\nCartridge RAM: 128 kB\nPower:\ninternal: 2 AA batteries, 30+ hours of gameplay\nexternal: 3V DC 0.6W\nindicator: Red LED\nInput:\n8-way D-pad\n4 buttons (A, B, Start, Select)\nVolume potentiometer\nPower switch\nSerial I/O (\"Link cable\"): 512 kbit/s with up to 4 connections in serial\nInfra-red I/O: Less than 2 m distance at 45\nCartridge I/O\nDimensions:\nMetric: 75 mm x 27 mm x 133 mm\nImperial: 2.95 in x 1.06 in x 5.24 in\nThe processor, which is a Z80 workalike made by Sharp with a few extra (bit manipulation) instructions, has a clock speed of approximately 8 MHz, twice as fast as that of the original Game Boy. The Game Boy Color also has three times as much memory as the original (32 kilobytes system RAM, 16 kilobytes video RAM). The screen resolution was the same as the original Game Boy, which is 160x144 pixels.\n\nThe Game Boy Color also featured an infrared communications port for wireless linking. The feature was only supported in a few games, so the infrared port was dropped from the Game Boy Advance line, to be later reintroduced with the Nintendo 3DS, though wireless linking (using Wi-Fi) would return in the Nintendo DS line. The console was capable of showing up to 56 different colors simultaneously on screen from its palette of 32,768 (8x4 color background palettes, 8x3+transparent sprite palettes), and could add basic four-, seven- or ten-color shading to games that had been developed for the original 4-shades-of-grey Game Boy. In the 7-color modes, the sprites and backgrounds were given separate color schemes, and in the 10-color modes the sprites were further split into two differently-colored groups; however, as flat black (or white) was a shared fourth color in all but one (7-color) palette, the overall effect was that of 4, 6 or 8 colors. This novel method of upgrading the color count did result in graphic artifacts in certain games; for example, sometimes a sprite that was supposed to meld into the background would be colored separately, making it easily noticeable.\n\nFinally,\n\nBuy if,\n\nYou like Nintendo,\n\nYou wan't to have a fun looking console,\n\nWan't to have the console to play Pokemon for hours.\n\nDon't buy if,\n\nYou hate Nintendo,\n\nYou have no desire to collect Nintendo products,\n\nYou just wan't to use a Gameboy Advance SP (which is fair)", "summary": "I had no idea color existed before this", "unixReviewTime": 1414886400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2014", "reviewerID": "A1CHTS5F0FN5P8", "asin": "B00000J97G", "style": {"Color:": " Teal"}, "reviewerName": "Kimberly M.

Other than that, this console has improved on its graphics! On games like Super Mario Bros. Deluxe and Pokemon Gold and Silver, the graphics are much better! Also, there is a ample amount of color that your eyes can feast on. Now if you have game boy Pocket and Regular game boy and you're playing Pokemon [It doesn't matter which one], you will notice that when you walk around in Pocket, It's very blurry. Well this fault has ben fixed in GameBoy Color. It's extremely helpful because it enables you to see more detail and little things that you couldn't see before. I also have some regular gameboy games that aren't for game boy color and if you play them on GameBoy color, they show little color, but no blurryness. Now make sure you read what the box says when you are buying a gameboy color game. There are two types, there is one that says FOR GAMEBOY COLOR ONLY, which you can't use on the other gameboys. The second type just says that it's for gameboy color. Those you can play on the regular gameboys. It won't show any color but at least you can play it. There are a couple faults for the gameboy color. One of which is that the console is too small [for me I have big fingers so it's hard for a grown up kid]. A second fault is that the batterys run out faster than the Original GameBoy [The gameboy pocket battery use is outrageous! I played the gameboy pocket for 2 hours straight and the batterys were already starting to run out.]. The original gameboy lasted me up to 23 hours! This only lastes me for about 12.

Tucker", "reviewText": "Alpha 3 is the culmination of everything Capcom had worked towards with their fighting games. Everyone knows Capcom has the habit of sticking to similar concepts for several games in a row (Mega Man, Resident Evil, etc), but in no other case has the last game in a series before a major change been so fulfilling.\n\nStreet Fighter Alpha 3 is (in my opinion) the best Street Fighter game available (including the recently-released SF2 HD Remix). The gameplay is a blend of the slow-paced and strategic Street Fighter 2 and the more varied and frenetic Alpha series. Air combos, alpha counters, and flashy finishing moves combine with superior character balancing and deep fighting strategy.\n\nThe main \"arcade\" experience can be brutally hard, as it would be in the wishes of any Street Fighter fan. The two-player experience is also extremely fun, as players new to the Alpha series can choose different fighting modes, one of which (X-ism) is more aligned with classic SF2 balancing. Other modes include A-ism, the Alpha standard, and V-ism, a mode that enhances a player's ability to chain standard and special moves together for lethal damage.\n\nAlpha 3 introduced an incredible World Tour mode, enabling players to tour the world (if you will) fighting various characters under various conditions. These tasks may be as simple as defeating an opponent to as complex as defeating three opponents with only super combo moves whilst your character is low on health. Completing these objectives unlock abilities that can be linked to your character, such as automatic blocking, taking zero damage while blocking, infinite guard, and more. On top of that, characters built up during World Tour mode are playable in other many of the other modes.\n\nThe other gameplay modes include training, boss battle, survival, and more. Two-player battles can also accommodate multiple player characters, in both versus and cooperative (ie P1 and P2 vs C1 and C2, or P1 and P1 vs P2 and P2). Two-player back in the days of SSF2:Turbo was the only way to play, but Alpha 3 dramatically increased the available options for single players. These lend towards the game's long life, as one player can play in various modes ranging from standard arcade style to fighting bosses to survival mode and more.\n\nIn essence, Street Fighter Alpha 3 defines fighting games of the Playstation era. It is a smooth balance of speed and strategy. Though the graphics are dated by today's standards, two-dimensional games tend to age gracefully, and this game is no exception. Street Fighter fans owe it to themselves to own a copy of Alpha 3, if not to check a popular franchise's history, then to own the best Street Fighter game ever made.", "summary": "The Ultimate Street Fighter game", "unixReviewTime": 1228780800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2007", "reviewerID": "AROWZGGO4VTJU", "asin": "B00000J9JI", "reviewerName": "Cosmic Soujourner", "reviewText": "If you are a Street Fighter die hard fan, then this game must be in your collection.

Some animation problems are present here and there (some characters have newly animated moves that don't quite fit with their old set of animation frames), the endings could have had more attention paid to them, and some of the music is rather bland.  Also, for those of you who may not know, the Alpha series is supposed to take place between the events of the original Street Fighter and Street Fighter 2.  So why are we seeing characters appear that are from the later versions of Street Fighter 2, such as Deejay, Fei Long, T. Hawk and Cammy?  Even though Capcom may need to work on the story a bit, it's still nice to see all of the Street Fighters together in one game, so I'm not complaining. Even though there have been countless versions of Street Fighter before it, Street Fighter Alpha 3 proves that you can't beat a classic formula, and that the series is still very enjoyable.

This is the definitive fighting game for the Playstation.\nThe graphics will be familiar to anyone who's played Street Fighter or the Alpha series, but they do have a newer, fresher anime style about them.  The large anime drawing of the characters after they win a match is also very cool.  They animate very well, much better than in Marvel vs. Capcom.  The sound effects are also great, and the music is excellent.  My only minor complaint about the music is that the classic character themes are gone.  I preferred the old classic songs to these new ones.  But, that's not too big of a deal.\nAnyone who says this game has no depth simply doesn't have a clue about its system.  Each character has three different fighting styles, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages.  Some moves and super moves are only available in certain fighting styles.  Some fighting styles are better for attacking, and others are better defense, counters, and reversals.\nThe super moves are not as spectacular as a Capcom vs. title, but they're still excellent in themselves.  They are also not insanely powerful, unless the character has been trained and leveled up a whole lot.  Which brings me to my next favorite aspect of this game:\nThe World Tour mode.  This was a great addition to Street Fighter.  Some say it's been ripped off from Soul Edge or Soul Caliber, but considering how badly other games have ripped off Street Fighter over the years (all the SF clones on the SNES, and even Tekken rips off the characters now), I don't think that argument can stand.  This mode allows you to choose a character and go on a world tour, fighting lots of matches with different stipulations, such as super combos only, multiple opponents, etc.  As you do this, your character raises levels and gains new abilities, perhaps being able to use some abilities that his fighting style would not normally allow.  You also gain the ability to change your balance of power, making your character lean more toward offense to hit harder, or defense to take less damage, or remain neutral.\nIn fact, this game has all sorts of cool extra features to be unlocked, as well as secret characters.  Now, there are not many secret characters at all, but those that are there are far better than most of the ones in Tekken (Come on now--you can't seriously hope to compare Gon, Mokujin, or even True Ogre to Shin Akuma).  The other features include the Dramatic Battle, which lets you fight 2 on 1 against the computer at high difficulty, the Survival Mode, which lets you see how far you can get as both the difficulty and number of simultaneous opponents increase, and the Final Battle, which simply lets you choose any character and fight the last boss so that you don't have to play them all the way through the Arcade Mode.  With all these cool extras, plus the fact that the Arcade Mode actually has a good story behind it, this game never runs out of replay value.  You're always looking for something new to try, or just to pop the game in for a quick play.\nOne of the coolest aspects of this game is its characters.  There is a huge variety to choose from, and each is played differently than the next.  At the same time though, none of the characters really seem silly or out of place, except perhaps Rainbow Mika...  That's a matter of opinion I guess.\nOverall, this is the best Street Fighter game I've ever played, and the best fighting game in general that I've ever played.

Or more precisely, the Mudokons. When an eavesdropping Abe finds this out, he starts ham-stepping stage left, right quick, proving that curiosity can save the cat, too. Your goal, as Abe, is to escape Rupture Farms, liberating as many fellow Mudokons as possible, and find a way to bring down the entire plant. But playing a Christ figure isn't as easy as we'd all like to think. Using a limited vocabulary set, Abe must convince the Mudokons to follow him to safety, all the while racing through the factory flipping switches, avoiding obstacles, evading heavily armed guards, and staying alive.\nGive me more, we need more games like this one.", "summary": "This game's the bomb!", "unixReviewTime": 1291420800}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "2", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2010", "reviewerID": "A4C38HZYNECXJ", "asin": "B00000JHPN", "reviewerName": "dib", "reviewText": "This is one of the Great Games to have ever come out.  It is not enough to even call it a true \"classic\".  It's not only an absolute top quality puzzle-style game, but it has a great story, unique and original characters and settings, and beautiful graphics.  And just the originality of that beautiful new world, \"mythology\", and fantastic concepts make this game a cut above the rest!\n\nWhy is it \"Great\"?  It's a real puzzle game.  Not that there's always one solution, or a right or wrong way to do things, but it is a game that focuses on technique, creative thinking, finesse, and (sometimes) quick reflexes.  There is no life bar; the game doesn't focus on that, or combat, it focuses on simply being able to figure out a solution and being able to execute it.  And it's fun, not boring and repetitive, but also very challenging.  And you have unlimited lives, which makes for playing with friends a lot of fun as you can pass around the controller to see who has the best ideas and skills.  It is as much fun to watch as it is to play.\n\nOne of the original concepts behind the game was that the main character was supposed to be \"non-violent\", but that isn't entirely the case as there is violence of a sort.  The main character just isn't directly violent.  But this is one of the highlights of the game, not a detraction (as I, and most gamers, would normally consider it to be).  You can't just plow your way through levels: you have to think, watch, time your actions, and adapt to the challenges.  But, when you do get those few opportunities to just gun your way through a level, it only makes it that much more fun.\n\nAnd the game is tight.  The controls are very well done.  You can easily master the fast maneuvers to co-ordinate with the necessary actions and specific spacing needed.  You'll get frustrated in some hard areas, but you will be able to play fast and risky (just kind of show off) or you can play slow and cautious.  It's all up to you and if you want to take your time and get through it with as few attempts as possible or if you want to just try to fly through an area and risk killing yourself a lot.  Sometimes luck favors the brave.\nAnd the game environment is solid.  A very well done and/or tested.  I don't recall ever finding anything that was glitchy.\n\nIf you like quality puzzle-focused games that have straight-forward challenges (the game doesn't scale or do anything cheap to mess with you - try to \"make the game more challenging\"), and enjoy a good storyline (with great humor that doesn't take away from the game), you really should check out Abe in Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee (and Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus).

However, it may not be worth paying the exorbitant used prices (the cheapest I found my copy was $60, then one of the discs was all scratched up and nonfunctioning, and I had to buy new discs for $30!  Yikes!).  Anyway, let's see if Lunar withstands the test of time.\n\nGraphics (score 8/10): Well, since this version of Lunar (the Playstation version) was enhanced from the original, it looks really good for an older RPG, especially when compared to the playstation ports of Final Fantasy V and VI.  However, the graphics are still undeniably dated.  On the bright side, anime cutscenes are interspersed throughout the game. There's also an anime portrait whenever they speak, which adds much needed detail to the characters (so you can see what they really look like).\n\nMusic (score 7/10): Music is decent, nothing that would make you buy the soundtrack or anything.  There are a couple vocal tracks in the game, which are also decent.  Thankfully, Luna's singing voice isn't too grating on the ears.  I still don't understand, though, why everyone in the game keeps referring to her amazing singing voice, when in my opinion, she is only average.  Well anyway, there is limited voice acting in the game during scenes and also a couple battle phrases.  The voice acting is pretty good; the only voice I'm glad we don't hear much of is Nall's, which I imagine would get really annoying (it's high-pitched and squeaky).  You don't get to hear much voice acting anyway, since it's really only present during cutscenes.\n\nCharacters (score 8/10): Characters are likeable and amusing.  They do have a decent amount of depth to their personalities, so you really come to be attached to them.  Because the story is so basic, the likeable characters are really what keep this game afloat.  Also, some of the NPCs are downright hilarious!\n\nStory (score 7/10):  Lunar is certainly no Final Fantasy VII.  The story itself is pretty basic.  You start off as Alex, who sets off on a quest to become a Dragonmaster (person of status who helps keep things in order and peace).  Then the story falls into the old pattern of finding X number of things (in this case, 4 dragons) and saving the world from a power-hungry would-be ruler along the way.  This is sort of the formula for every RPG in existence, but at least other games add in unique and intriguing twists on this old formula to keep things interesting.  Lunar's storyline really has no extra twists or new concepts in it to keep things interesting (thus it relies on excellent characterization).  I really wish the game had explored certain concepts in more detail, such as the why the Vile Tribe rejected Althena, Ghaleon's motivations, and Althena's personality, motivations, and origin.  However, given the age of this game, the lack of story depth is forgivable.  After all, almost all games made during this time period were pretty shallow story-wise.\n\nBattle System (score 8/10): Battles are a basic turn-based system.  The usual attack, defend, magic, item commands.  As an interesting twist, you can move around the battle screen, thus making position a part of strategy.  The only complaint I have with battles is that there is an \"A.I.\" command, whereby you can have the battle automatically fought for you.  I didn't really like this because the option is listed first in the menu, which means you'll spend some time accidentally hitting it.  It would've been better if they'd put it at the bottom of the menu.  Well, this isn't really a big deal since the cursor in the game \"remembers\" where you last had it and always starts up there.  So, once you turn on the game and select \"command\", the next battle will have the cursor already on \"command\".  This was quite convenient.\n\nGameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  One thing of note is that the menu system was a bit confusing, at least for me.  I really felt that it was needlessly complicated and I never quite got the hang going through it quickly.  It's rather annoying having every party member have their own \"equip\" menu when you could just have one big \"equip\" option, and then just select a character from there.  I also hated having to physically put equipment in the person's hand before I could equip it.  It would've been better to just let me select a person, and then have every available piece of equipment in inventory for them pop up in a list.  Shuffling items from Nall's inventory to each individual character's inventories is a pain, especially if their inventory is full, and you have to move items out first.  Well, anyway, also of note is the leveling system.  Bosses are always the same level as Alex is, but regular enemies all have their own preset levels.  This means that you must strike a delicate balance between under-leveling and over-leveling.  I really liked this feature since it kept you from having to level grind all the time.  Also, enemies appear onscreen--so there are no random battles, which is awesome.  Overall, the gameplay is very smooth and enjoyable, especially for an older game.\n\nOverall (score 7/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Overall, this was a decent, enjoyable game.  Even though the story isn't the best, I really enjoyed the characters and they kept me playing.  Is this game worth playing? Yes.  Is this game worth the eventual $90 I had to spend on it?  Definitely not.  I personally don't think this game is worth more than $40.  If you can find it for less than that, then go for it.  If not, then you might want to try the GBA remake, Lunar Legend (though I don't know how good it is, since I've never played it).  If you don't happen to ever play this game, then it's no real loss since there are plenty of contemporary RPG's available that are much better.", "summary": "So, you ask, is this old-school game still worth playing?", "unixReviewTime": 1235779200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2008", "reviewerID": "A1EHPSG1JK3C0V", "asin": "B00000JIUG", "reviewerName": "Jeff Brugamyer", "reviewText": "I had just started playing rpg's when I picked this one up, it was probably my third or fourth rpg that I played. I absolutely fell in love with this game the moment it started. I never played the orignal or second on the Sega CD.\n\nStoryline: What can I say, its your typical boy loves girl, girl gets kidnapped and boy saves world and girl. Fortunately, rpg's are great not because of the story but how the story is told and Working Designs did a brilliant job in the storytelling. They took the story and put a few twists here and there but not to the extreme or completely insane, they left it a simple story and made it an epic masterpiece. Lastly, this game has one of the most memorable villians in an rpg to date. Ghaleon is a great villian who has a great background story that unfolds extremely well during the game and in my eyes he ranks right up there with Sephiroth.\n\nCombat system: For whatever reasons Working Designs left it simple and turn based and keeping to the sprites instead of trying to make the fights 3-D. With games like FFVII, Legaia and others going 3-D this gave a lot of ridicule to the game itself, a very unfortunate thing too. It was nice for the characters to have only certain things they could do, like Alex could only use special sword attack and no magic as where Jessica could only use magic. It kept the fighting more tactical and also made everyone in the group important and not just a space filler.\n\nGraphics: Working Designs kept to the sprites and kept it looking a 32 bit rpg. They did do something to keep the story moving along with anime clips, wonderfully done by the way, which they used to introduce characters and to help the storytelling.\n\nMusic: The battle music gets repetitive and so does the traveling music as I think they could've done a better job in that department. The voice acting was done really well but the women's voices do get a bit high pitched at times and it happens to the guys on occasion.\n\nThe characters were developed nicely, each having their own background story which adds to your liking and caring about each of your character in your party. You can easily put 50+ hours in the game and also there are whats called Bromides to collect. Bromides are anime pictures in the game which you can collect throughout your travels-I believe there are 12 in all.\n\nExtras Disc: I watched it and enjoyed the voice actors and developers talking about how much fun they had making the game and what they did to add what they thought would help the game out.\n\nThis game despite its old-school graphics and traditional fighting system gets a 5 out of 5 for its wonderful story and loveable characters.", "summary": "Can't say enough about this game....", "unixReviewTime": 1223510400}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "3", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2008", "reviewerID": "A1AISPOIIHTHXX", "asin": "B00000JIUG", "reviewerName": "Cloud", "reviewText": "It's kind of hard to tell RPG players the appeal of Lunar when other games have more stellar graphics, more complicated storylines and deeper gameplay systems. While some of the older games from the SNES era are considered RPG classics despite very outdated looks, it's strange trying to do the same for Lunar since it wasn't quite as big or as mass-appealing. While yes graphically and storyline wise, this isn't exactly Vagrant Story or even Final Fantasy stuff, there was always an appeal to the Lunar games that made you forget about it and just enjoy it anyway.\n\nStory: You play as Alex from the town of Burg who wants to become just like the Dragonmaster Dyne. But an encounter with a Dragon has Alex, his pet dragon Nall and friend Luna on a quest to save the world where they'll be taken to floating cities and different cities to save the world of Lunar. Again it's not the most deepest and complex RPG plot but like a lot of classic fairytales and fantasy stories, there's a wide appeal for the story simply because of the charming characters and just the general atmosphere of the game.\n\nGraphics: You'll notice a difference between the new stuff and the \"revamped\" stuff. Basically the new is fully-animated cutscenes which help flesh out special events but usually they're served as character introductions. They're gorgeous with great character designs and they really stand out. Everything else is iffy since the overworld/town stuff is incredibly simplistic with mini-sprites and character portraits during dialogue. But if you love Final Fantasy VI or Chrono Trigger, than this kind of graphic style is nothing.\n\nSound/Music: Soundtrack was done by Noriyuki Iwadare who's quite talented at doing upbeat catchy themes and although music-wise it can get slightly repetitive, they're quite fun and the vocal tracks are quite stellar. Sound work otherwise is functional but not impressive as swords clang and enemies die with small groans but this isn't really one of those \"immersive\" sound worlds like Metroid or Bioshock where there is tons of ambience. The voice acting though is quite stellar and aside from the Metal Gear series, Lunar is usually mentioned among games that best use voice acting.\n\nGameplay: Lunar does something different (though not together uncommon) in that spells are actually gained when you obtain a certain level as opposed to finding them in the world, buying them from shops and the like. It encourages level grinding so you can obtain new spells though enemies can get just as bad since they can level up with you a little (mainly bosses though) but really it's just going through a dungeon, beating enemies - which are thankfully onscreen like Chrono series - finding item chests and making it to the boss and whomping them. There's also some collectables called bromides which are character artworks that show up as mini-cutscenes and since the ladies are quite lovely to ogle, I like collecting the things.\n\nSince there was extra care in the making of the game, we get some added stuff like the cd soundtrack, an artbook with a readily-available walkthrough inside (complete with funny captions, character artwork and interviews with game developers) and a map. Might not be the absolute best RPG to many people but there's lots of fans, myself included of course, and Lunar is one to pick up, or at least try.", "summary": "4.5; an RPG classic remade", "unixReviewTime": 1203379200}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "7", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2008", "reviewerID": "A29BQ6B90Y1R5F", "asin": "B00000JIUG", "reviewerName": "Tsanche", "reviewText": "Lunar Silver Star Story first debuted on the Sega CD.  While the Sega CD system didn't last very long, Lunar did manage to get quite a following.  Unfortunately, because the Sega CD user base wasn't large, Lunar was overlooked by several gamers.  The game had a release on the very short lived Sega Saturn, but again, never reached audiences.  In 1999 Lunar finally reached a large audience.  The Playstation.  With several changes and updates from the original Sega CD version to make the story more complete and satisfying.\n\nLunar Silver Star Story Complete concerns itself with Alex.  He one day dreams of being a Dragonmaster.  Just like his hero, Dyne.  He figures he'll just have to keep dreaming, though.  Until his friend Ramus has a plan to go into the White Dragon cave and get a hold of the White Dragon Diamond.  Finally, a chance for Alex to go on an adventure.  But it ends up becoming much bigger than he ever dreamed.\n\nFor the most part, Lunar Silver Star Story has a cliched overly done storyline.  Despite that, however, it is one of the best in the genre because it has a fantastic cast of characters who are all well developed, a good sense of humor, one of the best villains in video game history as well as a very emotional story.  All these things make you forget the cliched storyline and make it something enjoyable and memorable.  The story also has a few really great looking anime cinematics and some incredibly good voice acting to help flesh out the humor and wit.  It also helps that the dialog is extremely well written.  Put simply, the story is presented very well.\n\nThe gameplay is dated, but that's to be expected for a game originally released in 1992.  Lunar has a straightforward combat system.  It's the simple turn based fare you've seen in dozens of RPGs.  You'll select an action for every character to do and then watch the battle play out as your enemies and you take turns.  Every character can either attack, use special techniques unique to only them use items and run away, etc.  Battles are contact based.  That doesn't mean enemies will simply let you waltz by.  Many enemies upon seeing you will give chase.\n\nLunar is by no means a complicated game.  Every character gains magic through levels (save for Alex who will get a few spells from meeting certain objectives in the story) and has their own unique magic.  For example, Nash is the only character who can cast Thunder Magic.  There are a few tidbits to the battle system that help flesh it out and keep it from being overly repetitive.  For one, characters who use staves can use them to cast spells that they otherwise might not be able to cast.  There's also a huge emphasis on strategy here.  Lunar is not an easy game by any stretch of the imagination.  Especially up against the bosses.  You'll find you have to move your characters all over the field and heal every turn to keep yourself a float.  To make matters even more difficult, you only have a limited number of items you can carry and on top of that, items at the market are quite expensive and monsters don't drop a lot of money.  So even though battles are contact based, it's probably best to fight as many as you can.  The only major problem with Lunar's battle system is that battles aren't quick.  Even normal battles can last for several minutes because of having to heal yourself constantly.  For the most part, though, the trip through the game is very rewarding.\n\nVisually, Lunar is a very colorful, artistic looking, smooth running game.  It doesn't push the Playstation to its limits, but it does manage to be a good game nonetheless.  The artistic design is incredibly well done, though.  So are the character portraits and animated cutscenes.  It's actually a very beautiful looking game, but it looks like a smooth over sixteen bit game too.  Luckily, this won't bother most gamers.\n\nIt sounds pretty good.  As mentioned before, the voice acting is some of the best in the industry.  Many of the tunes are quite catchy (particularly the world map and battle themes).  They're short tracks, though, so they loop real soon, which makes much of the music quite repetitive.  In the long run, though, you're getting quite a bit.\n\nLunar Silver Star Story Complete originally came with a lot of extras.  A soundtrack CD filled with the best tracks, a cloth map, a making of CD and a hardcover instruction booklet that even included a sample of the strategy guide made by Working Designs themselves.  It's quite the collector's item to have.\n\nLunar Silver Star Story Complete is a fantastic RPG that despite being released on the Playstation, was still fairly overlooked.  It does, however, retain a strong audience.

The original great game is here, with a few good enhancments. The best one being the Anime scenes. Very well done, and they help move the story along nicely. The game's not up to par with the likes of most Final Fantasy games, or many other Square/Enix RPG's, but it's definitely a must have for any RPG fan.\nGameplay: 8.1/10\nI'll start with the battle system. The battles you run into to aren't random; you can see them on the screen, and avoid some of them if you don't want to battle. A lot of them are impossible to avoid, though; this is needed, so you aren't just running through the game not fighting. You have the usual attack, run, and skills during the battles. When you have your character do a physical attack, he will move to the enemie he's attacking and stay in that spot while the enemies do their attacks. Some of the enemy attacks will move your character a spot or two back. This way, there's some strategy involved on the placement of your character. Each enemy has a certain amount of spots it can move, so if you want to stay away from some of them, don't attack an enemy that's surrounded by other enemies, because they all will be in attacking range, and they will all get a good attack in on you. A lot of the times, I didn't really worry about this, but it's a little added strategy to the battles other than the usual fighting. One of the more useful ways of taking advantage of this, though, is to defend on one turn, let the enemies move close to you, and then hack and slash away. This way, you don't move in without getting an attack on your enemy, and letting them attack you. Be smart, and you can avoid a hit here and there. The battles are turn based, by the way; none of that meter stuff seen in most Final Fantasy games. Really either way is good to me.\nThe way skills are learned in this game is just your basic learn a skill at a certain level system. Example: Learn a small healing spell at level 5. There's no custom way of learning your attacks. You have to realize, that this came out in the early 90's, where there was only a game here and there had a deep system to go along with it. It gets the job done, but it's not as advanced as some RPG'ers would like. I didn't mind, though. Don't let this turn you away from the game. You will miss out on a memorable experience if you do.\nThe areas in this game are big, good looking, and fun to work your way through. Your usual RPG stuff is here. Caves, Villages, Castles, etc. They offer up a good challenge, too, which you can't say about a lot of RPG's out there. It's not impossible by any means, but it's not easy either. Good challenge. The world you travel through is well designed, and pretty big. As a whole, you won't find a bad or boring level in this game. It's an expansive RPG world, with many fun challenges along the way.\nThe characters are very good. They are pretty artistic. A couple basic looking ones, but overall, they have my pick as some of the better ones in an RPG, ever. The character development is not too bad, either. It's not the best, but you should soon care for each character atleast a little. Especially the main ones like Alex, and Luna.\nI like the story a lot. You won't find a deep, complex plot. You get a straight-foward, hero defeating the villian, type of story. There's a good surprise here and there, but not many. You will grow to hate the villians, and the story, while not being too complex, pulls you in and doesn't let you go until you finish the game. I guarantee you will enjoy it.\nI take off the 1.9 because the battle system can get repetitive near the end of the game. The boss battles have you basically using the same spell per character each turn, hoping you have enough left to finish him off. This makes the usual fun boss fights, a little less fun than normal. Atleast they're challenging, though, since they always have the same level as your characters. I didn't take off any more for the semi-basic storyline, and not so deep skill learning system because of the time it came out. That's something you have to realize when playing this game: it was one of the best for it's time.\nReplay Value: 6.5/10\nAs with a lot of RPG's, it's not very good. I, and many will play through again for the positives I mentioned above, but there's really no incentive to come back and play through the 25+ hour quest again. Only for the hardcore RPGer, I guess.\nMusic: 8.2/10\nOverall, some very nice tunes scattered through out the game. It's not mind blowing like some of the Square soundtracks, but it's a good one. You will enjoy it for the most part, I know I did.\nGraphics: 9/10\nI'm basing it on the year it came out. The levels,and battle graphics look stunning. With that said, though, the characters suffered and look pretty bland. That's the reason for the 1 point off. Not a major problem at all, though. Especially when you play this one for the gameplay, like all RPG's.\nOverall:(Not an average) 8.5/10\nFor it's time, it offered a fun battle system, great graphics, a good story, and clever, fun level design. One of the best games in the genre at the time, and rightfully so. It has taken a slight hit over the years, but overall, it has stood the test of time pretty well. RPG fans would be wise to not miss out on this. With the special package one, you get tons of extra goodies; well worth the money, although it's only possible to find it on sites like Ebay.

(I sense people who wrote reviews frowning) I did finish this game and trust me, I had lot of expectation for this game. I haven't played the Sega CD version of it and actually blamed one of the reviewers from EGM, who gave 8.5 when rest of them gave 9 or higher. I thought this game deserves at least 9, I mean, look at the animation, the title animation is one of the most well-represented animated beginning ever, and the music was just amazing.  I was constantly humming the tune because it was so, so, SO GOOD- couldn't help myself from humming it all the time. Not only that, Working Design did a fantastic/excellent job on putting in all the extra you are getting with this game, it's simply amazing- I'm left with no choice but to give credit for that.  However, after I finish the game, I realized that I came to conclusion too soon, when I did play only beginning portion of the game, mesmerized with beautifully animated movie scene.\nI wasn't inspired or felt that heartache or anything like that..\n  I mean, characters are adorable and the story is good enough to pull you in, however, it wasn't just strong enough-\nSo when I read several reviews saying this is the best RPG for PS or anything like that, I just couldn't agree with what they were saying, of course, everyone has right to their own opinion, but in my humble opinion, I just didn't feel it.  It seemed to me that I'm more attracted to the games with more stronger theme, like Xenogear, and Lunar falls into mild-themed game, which is, of course, enjoyable.\nI didn't buy the sequel, Eternal Blue, which comes with more extra and whole box for the game looks great, however, I wasn't inspired enough to purchase Eternal Blue because it wasn't just there to hook me, wasn't just there...\nWell, it's definitely your call.. so if the price is reasonable for you and plenty of time, then give it a try and see how it goes.

Then the hero searches for the White Dragon to become like his hero and from there, he ends up in a battle for the entire land of Lunar. It seems like a straightforward story with plot twists you'll probably see a mile away but the way that it's executed is so masterful.\nThere's some much needed humor in the game involving some pop culture references, such as when a traveller tells Nall(a flying cat) how much licks does it take to get the the center of a Tootsie Pop when it was an owl in the commercial.\nThe music isn't incredibly memorable but it adds life and great background to each location and event the music is featured. The voice acting is amazing some great voices. The one thing that feels odd to me is the voice of Alex, Ashley Angel, is a member of the boy-band O-Town. Although it isn't the most baddest thing in the world, it feels odd.\nDon't expect mind-blowing visuals. These look quite old but they don't retract from the gameplay.

One is a soundtrack, which is nothing to be excited about since the music isn't something you'd want to listen to outside of the game, but is a nice touch.  The other is a making of CD that was rather interesting because you get to see how much the people who made this game were into it and cared about the finished product.\nOne of the neat things about this game is all of the voice acting.  It's such a nice touch and really adds a lot to the game.

The story was flawless and breathtaking then, and yet, somehow, it all seems better this time around. What makes Lunar Lunar though is the fact that Working Designs was behind it. They can translate even the lamest games and make them playable (I even bought Shining Wisdom for my Saturn just because of Working Designs!). The people at Working Designs are a bunch of comedians. There are so many jokes in this game it's unbelievable (second only to Final Fantasy IX in humor). The game has received an upgrade in every single way, most notably, the graphics. Yes, the graphics aren't an important part of any game, but it's nice to see that they got an uplift this time around. Back to the story though. Everything about the story is perfect, it's beautiful, it's touching, and it's one of the best in any game I have ever seen. I could go into more detail...but you should really play it for yourself. What surprised me about playing Lunar again was the length of the game. It's pretty long. While not as long as its sequel, it still offers days of fun like I had with the original version. The characters themselves are great. Typical of their RPG times? Yes, but great nonetheless. Especially Alex and Nall, who I just loved. The difficulty of the game is very applaudable as well. Not incredibly difficult, but it's not easy either, and that's just another reason why I love this game so much. The one thing that didn't stand the test of time was the battles. They're very straight-forward and basic, nothing to it at all. It's just tap...tap...tap. Boring indeed. Thankfully the random number of battles isn't frequent. The packaging also needs mention. Lunar:SSSC comes with a nice box that contains a 100+ page leatherette hardbound artbook/instruction manual, a making of Lunar CD, a music CD, and a full-color cloth map. Who loves ya? Working Designs! Unfortunately, new-school gamers might be put off by Lunar's old-school look and feel continuously asking \"Where's Bahamut Zero?\" This is unfortunate because it looks like Lunar might go back to the cult status it had on the Sega CD instead of selling by the truckloads like it deserves. Oh well...definitely their loss. Nevertheless, this is a masterpiece. Lunar:SSSC should be as mandatory as the controller for PSX owners.

What drew me to Lunar, was the thought of dragons, and the cat-like creature, Nall. That changed as soon as I got into the storyline.  Alex had lived in the small town of Burg all his life, with his companion, Nall, and Luna, a lovely young woman who Alex's parents had taken in.  Luna possesses a wondrous singing voice that ultimately gets her (and her friends) in quite a bit of trouble.  What I liked was that rather than set her up as the helpless damsel, Working Designs allowed Luna to accompany Alex on his quest to meet the white dragon.  She isn't much for fighting, but that magical voice of hers can charm, or frighten away most enemies. Along the way, we meet new friends, and new enemies.  Ultimately, it leads to (doesn't it always?) a battle between good and evil, with the sake of the world hanging in the balance!

The stock music is odd, but the voice clips (thankfully, used sparingly) are crystal clear. Sadly, they don't do anything to make the story any less incomprehensible.\n\nNow, we move on to the controls. Flying Superman is simple, if a little loose. Making tight turns is a problem, but you have a lot of freedom with the controls; you can even do a vertical loop without the need for a second analog stick (see Superman: Shadow of Apokolips). Getting him to stop is tricky, which can be a hassle if you need to land somewhere fast. Camera control (using the + Control Pad) allows you to rotate the camera around the Man of Steel, and his movement with the Control Stick is character-relative. Zooming in or out is also possible, so any Superman fans who want to make machinima about the last son of Krypton, go right ahead.\n\nFor some reason, you can't save at all unless you have a Controller Pak; but when I did have one, it never prompted me to save, nor did it do so automatically. Perhaps I didn't get far enough into the game? There's not even a password feature, so playing later is difficult.\n\nThe mission structure consists of vague objectives linked by timed flights through floating rings. Unless you have completely spastic fingers, the ring stages shouldn't be too hard; I was able to do the first one in two tries, not 100 (like many people seem to need).\n\nOverall, the game certainly isn't the worst ever made; not even close.

It's been almost 10 years since Titus released the most unorthodox game to ever grace our solar system.  It must be good, since we're still talking about all these years later.\n\nSeriously, there's a lot to like about SUPERMAN 64.  You won't need any sort of defect warranty, because the second you flip the POWER switch, it works every time.  It's refreshing to buy an electronic device, knowing that it's electrical circuits will never fail you.\n\nEqually cool is that Superman flies in this game...I like it when he flies.  Every time I pop in this cartridge, I'm even more eager to watch  the Christopher Reeve movies...all 4 of them.\n\nThe plot is revealed to the gamer with great restraint.  You see, there are bizarre, murky images that even David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick wouldn't be able to visualize.  For example, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are confined to, um...a blurry contraption that kidnaps them; or does it imprison them?  I personally couldn't tell if it was really Jimmy and Lois, because it's very hard for the gamer to completely understand the cutscenes.  But isn't it neat to figure it out for yourself?  You see, because the graphics are so confusing and blurry, you get to keep playing again to unearth the game's secrets.  And don't worry about completing SUPERMAN 64 in a short period of time, either.  It's a tough game, and there are few games that equal its challenge.\n\nWhat's most remarkable is how the game also addresses Superman's emotional state.  I'm sure Kal-El struggles to use his powers properly; it's not easy for a near-invincible alien to do the right thing 24/7.  Titus has tackled this concept very faithfully.  You see, when Superman flies, he won't always do what the N64 Controller tells him to do.  A free-spirited main character...brilliant!\n\nLastly, Superman's powers are present here.  He has his eye-lasers and wind/freeze breath.  That's always neat, huh?  But what's even more most fascinating is that The Man of Steel --- according to this game --- has the ability to manipulate the physical dimensions in which he exists.  He sometimes will be flying casually through the sky, and then have a sudden urge to fly through the buildings of Metropolis.  How cool is that?  On the other side of this spectrum, there are moments where Superman will get stuck in a wall or a drainage ditch......you know, I still haven't figured out how to beat those sections of the game.  I wonder, is there a higher power known only to Superman?  I ask, because Titus refuses to give us easy answers to this puzzling N64 entry.  The most gifted scientists, researchers, cryptologists, artists, and gamers will not be able to solve this enigma.\n\nSUPERMAN 64 is one of the most unforgettable and original experiences in all of gaming!\n\n*****THIS REVIEW WAS MEANT TO BE SARCASTIC AND SATIRICAL.

Myst is one of them. I remember playing this game back in 1993 and getting my but whipped with the puzzles. I recently replayed it and found myself in awe of how well constructed it is. Of course, graphics have advanced since 1993, but Myst shows game developers how puzzles should really work.\n\nUnlike too many games today, Myst brilliantly evokes a sense of wonder and mystery. When you start the game, you're just thrown into a new world with no explanation. You are left to explore and discover. There is a story with shocking twists, but the story depends upon your involvement and choices, not simply handed to you.\n\nThe puzzles require a lot of time and thought. If you don't like puzzles and thinking, don't play this game. If you like challenges, Myst will challenge you. The puzzles often require you to make connections between separate pieces of information or view your environment in a new way. Some are frustrating and I did need to look at a hint guide a few times (particularly for the Mechanical Age elevator) but they all do have a logic.\n\nUnlike other reviewers, I found the one area Myst doesn't hold up well is in building an immersive environment. Myst as a world doesn't have a logic. There's a spaceship, a boat, a clock tower, etc., just sitting on the island. It seems more like a video game hub than an actual world. I think Myst makes up for its lack of internal logic by leaving so much mysterious and presenting you with such intricate puzzles that you want to explore the world.\n\nOverall, Myst was a historic computer game back in 1993 and is still worth playing 20 years later. From the early 1990s, I personally preferred Presto Studios' Journeyman Project, which also had a compelling point-and-click adventure and featured pre-rendered 3D environments. However, until that game gets rereleased, Myst is easily the best point-and-click adventure readily out there.\n\nNote: the game is also available on iPhone, iPad, Nintendo 3DS, so there's no excuse not to try it out.", "summary": "A historic game that still has life in it", "unixReviewTime": 1338681600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "3", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2011", "reviewerID": "AJ27FPFTE22QR", "asin": "B00000JL60", "style": {"Edition:": " Standard", "Platform:": " PC"}, "reviewerName": "Nocturnal", "reviewText": "I can't remember if Myst was my first PC game.

But like a first love, I remember it very fondly and treasure it.  It's almost heart breaking to think that some day soon, as Windows continues to do upgrade to different styles of OS, newbies won't be able to experience Myst.  Just like so many young people will never know how it felt when rock'n'roll burst forth.  To confess, I liked the graphics in Riven better.

At most places, the game play wasn't strictly linear so you could play in whatever order you wanted.  You could \"spin\" around and see everything.  It was totally mouse driven.  One feature I loved (but many others complained about) was that it was an empty world, you never had to/got to interact with anyone else in Myst; for me it was somewhere of my own where I could explore to my heart's content, go back and walk around areas that I liked (like \"tree\" world (can't remember it's actual name) even after you finished that level.

While exploring, you begin to discover the dark past of the island which you are visiting. Using ingenious \"linking books\" you can access other islands and unravel the truth behind the lonely, mysterious worlds.\n\n-Environment\n\nThe environments, while not necessarily beautiful, are well done. There are a total of five islands, all with different motifs.

In general there is little character interaction, leaving the player dealing mostly with puzzles and exploring.\n\nMusic drifts in and out of the game, with some locations dominated by the sound of wind while others have music in the background. The music alternates between very dark to dark tinged. While the game does not have catchy tunes, it suits the game quite well as background music.\n\n-Characters\n\nThere are few characters, and interaction is limited. There is a selection of journals in a library which provide interesting reading and histories of the various islands.\n\n-Puzzles\n\nThis game is a puzzle game. The puzzles are generally mechanical in nature. The puzzle solutions can be illusive, but puzzles are generally not incredibly tedious. Once you have solved puzzles once, they can generally be solved again quickly, allowing you to replay the game without worrying about coming to mounds of impossible puzzles yet again.\n\nIf you enjoy puzzles that involve common sense more than mathematics and like interesting and unique worlds, you will enjoy \"Myst.\" The game has decent replay value.

Rand and Robyn Miller created a new type of game which diverted from the typical mass market and took off into a fascinating and innovative direction. It's hailed as a landmark in the industry and praised for both its aesthetics and story.\n\nI think that Myst is best described as an experience rather than merely a video game. Its creators strived to develop a world rich with detail and intrigue, with a subtle narrative intertwined into the strange yet beautiful surroundings. As the game begins, you are dropped onto the island of Myst without very much information to guide you. What immediately strikes you as unique about this experience is that there are no friendly characters to help you on your way, no enemies to fight, and not a very clear purpose. The game is largely about just exploring your surroundings and experimenting with different devices around the various worlds. This is what makes the game so immersive. The graphics of Myst, though not quite as extravagant as today's, were definitely of high quality. Cyan built its 3D world through an extensive layout of still images and QuickTime movies, and the end result is simply amazing. Navigation is node-based, meaning that you don't necessarily walk through the environment but rather point and click your way through your surroundings. Each new section loads as if you really had relocated, giving the appearance of movement. Making a 3D world in this manner might seem strange, but at the time it was a necessary shortcut to make it possible to run the game on computers without a lot of RAM and processor power. Even by today's standards, I still think the environments look impressive.\n\nSo what exactly does the gameplay entail? As you explore the island, you discover two journals with missing pages, each of which belong to Atrus's sons, Sirrus and Achenar. Your main objective is to travel through the different worlds, or Ages, and retrieve the missing pages from each book. As you recover each page, you learn more about each brother, and you must try to discover who is lying and who is telling the truth. In the end, it will be up to you to decide their respective fates. Your journey is not easy, for you will have to solve rather challenging puzzles in order to progress throughout the worlds. This can often be frustrating, for the puzzles' solutions are not always intuitive. It will take much patience and observation, and perhaps even a little help.\n\nThe sounds in this game are mysterious and enchanting. The soundtrack consists of strange, sometimes haunting tunes that blend in remarkably well with each respective area. Moreover, the sounds are integral to the gameplay, for some of the puzzles involve listening in addition to seeing. You will need to observe and interpret different sounds and apply that information to the challenges you face. This is yet another way in which you can truly become immersed within the game.

No one had any idea when the game first came out in 1993 that it would eventually become the best-selling computer game of all time.\nRand and Robyn Miller, the brothers who created the wildly successful game, hit upon a winning idea.  Place someone into an unknown world where the clues he or she uncovers reveals the story.  And one of the biggest perks of all - you can't die.\n\"Myst\" starts off by dumping you on a dock overlooking a vast ocean.  You can hear water lapping along the dock, and a wind makes the hair on your neck stand up.  And from there it only gets more interesting - you discover books that can link you to other worlds like this one, more commonly called Ages; you encounter all sorts of devices that, even though they don't appear to do much, are all part of the underlying thread tying the game together; and just by wandering around you immerse yourself in the world that is \"Myst.\"\nOccasionally, I meet people who are baffled at the success of \"Myst.\"  They don't understand how a game where you just walk around and solve stuff can be so appealing.  There is little or no character interaction, they say.  I've noticed that a lot of these same people are those who like those \"shoot'em up and splatter their guts all over the wall\" type of gamers.  The reason \"Myst\" has been so successful is because it so pure - you don't have to worry about dying, you use your head to get your way through things, and each new Age you encounter is just bursting with intriguing things to discover.  That and each world is beautiful.  Not as jaw-dropping as \"Riven\" and not nearly as mesmerizing as \"Myst III: Exile\", but \"Myst\" has a subtle yet majestic beauty that makes it stand apart from other games.\nIf you have never played a computer game before, give \"Myst\" a try.  You will be surprised at how addictive it can become.  Did I mention that there is no possible way in which you can be killed?  Seriously!  How many games today offer that?  There's a reason why it has been such a hit; millions and millions of people can't be wrong.", "summary": "Continues to Leave Me Mystified", "unixReviewTime": 1010188800}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "12", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2002", "reviewerID": "A3GRU9732S4V1U", "asin": "B00000JL60", "style": {"Edition:": " Standard", "Platform:": " PC"}, "reviewerName": "Robert", "reviewText": "Although the technology behind this game is a little dated now, this is still an excellent puzzler for those who like games that don't involve shooting monsters.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy blowing away bad guys as much as anyone else, but it's nice to play something a little different every once in a while.  This game does not depend at all on weapons or killing anything, nor does it require you to do a lot of jumping or physically manuvering around obstacles.  It is entirely a \"thinking\" game.  The closest you get to physical action is the fact that some of the puzzles to solve are mazes.\nYou start the game stranded alone on the Island of Myst, with no idea how you got there, and no idea how to get home.  Your only clue is a note found on the ground near the island's library.  From this slender beginning, you learn about the history of the island, about Altus and his two feuding sons, Sirrus and Achernar, and the four mysterious Ages you must visit and explore.  Be sure and explore the Library thoroughly.  Check everything.  The books in the library contain important clues.  They are not strictly necessary to solve the game, but they help out a lot, especially the Mechanical Age (with the rocket ship).  Personally, I found the Channelwood Age the most difficult, but all of the Ages can be solved with a little logic, and thorough exploration.  Each Age is also filled with little trinkets and gadgets that don't really help you solve the game, but they reveal a LOT about the personalities of Sirrus and Achernar.\nVisually, the game is absolutely gorgeous.  Each Age has an entirely different look and feel to it.  The user interface is extremely simple and intuitive.  The haunting soundtrack and well-done QuickTime animations also add a lot to the overall feel of the game.\nThe only people you will actually interact with at all in the game are the aforementioned Altus, Sirrus, and Achernar.  This leads me to my one and only complaint about the game.  I wish the Millers had spent a little more money to hire some better actors to play these roles, as all three of them are badly overacted.  But, that's a minor gripe.  Altus' acting is so bad, it's actually funny.\nOnce you've played through this game a couple of times, it becomes pretty easy.  However, I still maintain that the game does have a lot of replay value.  Why?  Becuase once you have figured everything out and memorized the solutions to all the puzzles, you can get to the end in about 3 or 4 hours, tops.  But that 3 or 4 hours is time well spent immersed in the game's beautiful environment.\nI've noticed several people who have mentioned that the game does not run well on Windows 98.  I've encountered this problem too.  If you install the game from the automatic installation dialog box that comes up when you insert the Myst CD, the game will play OK for a little while, but will eventually crash.  However, I was able to find a solution.  If you're running Windows 98 or newer, do NOT install from the dialog box.  Instead, go to the Install subdirectory on the CD, find the \"install.exe\" file there, and click on it to install the game that way.  The installation procedure is slightly different.  You'll know you are doing it the different way when the game installes to a new directory called c:\\myst.  If you use the automatic dialog box, it will install to a different subdirectory.  I installed the game using this alternate procedure, and it has been running fine with Windows 98.  I hope this helps anyone out there experiencing problems.
