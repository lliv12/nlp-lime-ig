I have been slowly adding some of these Peppa books to her collection, as she loves to be read to. She also loves swimming so I knew she would enjoy this one. She knows all the characters, and loves pointing them all out. This book is cute and colorful, however I personally thought it was lacking a little bit as far as the variety of pictures. Each page is pretty much the same with the characters in the pool, with some slight variations. However, as you can tell from my video this book has been well loved in just the couple months that we have had it. My daughter wants us to read it to her over and over, and she carries it around with her all the time looking at the pictures. So although the pictures are a bit repetitive to me, my daughter loves it and that is what matters most. There are 23 pages total not including the cover page, and there are just the right amount of words on the pages to tell a nice story without losing her attention. Overall I like this book, it just isn't my personal favorite in the series. I still would recommend it to anyone with a child who is a Peppa fan. This was a personal purchase bought at the full retail price. I am reviewing it solely to share my experience with other potential buyers.", "summary": "She also loves swimming so I knew she would enjoy this one", "unixReviewTime": 1465516800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2016", "reviewerID": "AIYVMK30Q2G1L", "asin": "0439499887", "style": {"Format:": " Paperback"}, "reviewerName": "Monica Lambert", "reviewText": "a gift and she loved it", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1465430400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 9, 2016", "reviewerID": "AIYVMK30Q2G1L", "asin": "0439499887", "style": {"Format:": " Paperback"}, "reviewerName": "Monica Lambert", "reviewText": "a gift and she loved it", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1465430400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2016", "reviewerID": "A1GQAKL9CGQLP1", "asin": "0439499887", "style": {"Format:": " Paperback"}, "reviewerName": "L.

It was so compact and easy to move around, which is a relief when you live in a small home filled to the brim with kids toys! As opposed to most large easels that require large amounts of floor space even when not in use, I really loved that this one could be folded up into a small size and stored away in an instant. However... within 3 months of receiving it, this product was literally falling apart at the seams. Now normally when a baby toy falls apart after a few months of use, I think \"well, yes, that's why I buy inexpensive toys - kids break them, duh!\" - except, my son was only 9 months old when this broke beyond repair, and had never physically manipulated this product at all! The only us this easel had gotten was from me taking it out about once a week and showing him some magnets while he gazed at it with interest before we fairly quickly moved on to the next activity, at which point I'd fold it up as directed and put it away until next week. Yet every time I folded up and unfolded this easel I noticed the seams were becoming flimsier and flimsier, the boards were seemingly tearing apart... but I still never expected to open it up one afternoon just to see one board finally break free and fall to the ground! All of this from an adult gently using this product for a few minutes, once a week? Yeah, in that case it was pretty disappointing!\n\nI must add that I love leaving reviews here as reading others' reviews helps me so much and I try to give back the same way. And maybe I'm just a really positive person in general, or perhaps I've just had good luck, but the fact remains that I virtually NEVER leave negative reviews for products, ever. I've written hundreds  of reviews here on Amazon and am quite sure this is only the 5th product, if that, that I've given less than 3 stars. I still can't bring myself to give it only 1 star as it WASN'T expensive, so I don't expect that much by way of quality and am not  exactly HORRIFIED that it fell apart, but I am certainly surprised that a few months of occasionally opening up, briefly using, and then properly storing away this little easel was enough to just... destroy it. Bizarre! And since I only owned one of these, I didn't try buying a second, I can't say with certainty that mine wasn't a rare defective one as there are certainly plenty of positive reviews on here... but I still wanted to share my experience because I know that many times people leave reviews after just receiving a product, or certainly within a few weeks of using it, and may not update those reviews later on. So perhaps if more reviews were left after several months of owning and using the product, there would be more experiences like mine... all I know for sure is that I try to be very reasonable with my expectations, and nothing short of a piece completely falling apart after gentle use would cause me to leave a negative review, so to anyone who's looking for an easel that will last them a long time, this may not be the one for you! However, if you just need this for a short period of time and don't want to shell out a fortune for it than this might meed your needs just fine.

The map itself was rolled in a plastic sleeve and there was a modest amount of packing material in the box to keep the map from shifting around. My map was in perfect condition when I removed it from the shipping box.  Kudos to the shippers at Amazon.\n\nThe map has a glossy finish but it is not stiff.  I guess when people read it is laminated, they associate that with laminated ID cards which are hard plastic.  This is best described as paper with a waterproof coating on it. I was not concerned about the coating as we plan to frame this and put it on the wall in our spare bedroom and use pins to mark all the places we travel to.\n\nThis map is absolutely beautiful and looks awesome framed and mounted. It shows many cities and towns in every state, it also show rivers and relief.  It identifies the major mountain ranges, shows most (if not all) National Parks, National Recreation Areas, National Monuments, mountains with their elevation, and much more. I can't express enough at how great this map looks and it was only $10.xx!  We've traveled to most of the US and are embarking on a 22 state trip during the summer of 2014 and we found out a pack of 100 map pins is not nearly enough.\n\nIn summary, you will be very happy with this map.  And we will try to remember to come back here and post a picture or video of it once we get it up on the wall.  If not, it will be on our web site.\n\nUPDATE:  I added a short video showing the map framed and mounted on the wall.

However, the linked map is only $5.95 (and still available for free shipping with prime).

I need a map to hang on the wall and trace routes with pins and strings.  The roads on this map are extremely faint... almost the same color as the background.  Seriously.

It has time zones, capitals, waterways, and mountain ranges all clearly marked\n\nThe negatives - it's not laminated, now if I was buying this for myself that would be fine, but the paper is also some strange form of paper that attracts and holds small sticky fingerprints.

Depending on how you're using the map, it could be helpful or simply get in the way; I had to trim it off because it went beyond the measurements given & got in my way.\n- Although not a problem per se, the laminating plastic is VERY glossy so (even though it's crystal-clear) at some angles there's a lot of glare on the surface.\n\nI bought the map for a mid-scale test of a much larger (planned) fiber-optic travel map, only I'm using it with regular map pins to save money. I found the best backing board to use was a foam board with a thin layer of cork on one side; it attached relatively easily with spray adhesive (although I braced it with 2 pieces of cheap wall moulding cut to length). As you can see from the closeup, it stands up well to being used as a pincushion. However, if you look closely at the full-map photo where the finished project is hanging on the wall, you can see from the way the light reflects off the plastic that even with lots of spray adhesive & heavy books holding it flat on the floor for several hours after glueing, there are still several large wrinkles that simply would NOT come out \"no matter what\" that are the result of the map constantly trying to re-roll itself. Since this photo was taken, I've also had to tape down the edges all around because it was beginning to peel itself away from the backing.\n\nAll in all, a good learning experience for the planned larger project, and a good map for general use as long as you're prepared for both the thinness and its annoying habit of always trying to re-roll itself.", "summary": "Very Good Map with Some Caveats for Project Use", "unixReviewTime": 1473206400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "08 25, 2016", "reviewerID": "A2JLHCS1SNTS3O", "asin": "0528959948", "style": {"Format:": " Map"}, "reviewerName": "james", "reviewText": "great!", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1472083200}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2016", "reviewerID": "A3K9LA0R8AGA8D", "asin": "0528959948", "style": {"Format:": " Map"}, "reviewerName": "Lao Wai", "reviewText": "Good size and can be used with erasable markers", "summary": "Four Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1468627200}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "2", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2016", "reviewerID": "ALLRDNLLV5MTY", "asin": "0528959948", "style": {"Format:": " Map"}, "reviewerName": "Wahoo Gal", "reviewText": "I purchased this at full price for my mom for Christmas.

Zack", "reviewText": "This is a very attractive binder for organizing recipes. The binder is sturdy and thick with a good, strong, set of rings that would hold up well under moderate use. The colors are bold and attractive, and the prints vibrant and exciting. The binder itself is organized into eight colorful sections separated by pocket dividers (Fruits & Vegetables, Breads & Pasta, Meats & Poultry, etc.) Each section has a different colored William Morris print, so you can visually tell the sections apart at a glance. Recipes can be three hole punched, tucked into the binder pockets, or copied onto recipe sheets that match the colors of the binder pockets (5 sheets per category, 3 recipes per sheet). Sheet protectors would be a useful addition to this binder to keep printed pages clean and accessible. The front and back covers have helpful information like metric equivalents, a roasting chart, and oven temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius.\n\nThis is a nice binder, and probably would be useful for someone far neater and more organized than I am. I am no Martha Stewart, and my kitchen is a busy, messy place where my children are as likely to be cooking as I am. To me, this binder is attractive, but basically useless. Firstly, as most of my recipes are printed off the internet, I would get little use out of the printed sheets. Even my old family recipes have been typed, and other recipes remain in the annotated cook books I got them from. I don't have the patience to hand copy recipes, and I prefer to type because my handwriting is messy. The binder has a fairly durable cover, and is treated so as to be water resistant, but I suspect that in MY kitchen, at least, this binder would quickly get dirty from spills. In addition, I question the utility of a three-ring-binder for long term use. Although I have not tested this one extensively, I generally can count on a year of use from a high quality school binder in daily use. Since this won't get nearly the same level of wear and tear, then perhaps I could get a few years before the binder stops smoothly opening and closing, gets caught, or the cover becomes overly damaged. I doubt this would survive long enough to be passed on down to my children. The binder is also stiff, and inflexible, and doesn't fully close so all my recipes are constantly slipping sideways or to the bottom. I can't easily put the binder on its side either because it is so bulky it takes up a lot of space on my counter, and does not fit easily into my cabinets. In addition to the pointless recipie cards, the pre-printed recipie sections are more or less useless to me. They would have been better off allowing us to customize the dividers ourselves. An entire section dedicated to beverages? Really? And breads combined with pasta when most of my recipies involve either breads or pastas? Clearly this binder is way too fancy for my kind of cooking.\n\nI am not sure this binder, as attractive as it is, warrants a cost of $22. The recipe cards are useless to me, and although the charts in the cover are useful, I could print my own. Also, the recipie subdivisions don't match the way I actually cook. So really what we are looking at is a very expensive, albeit beautiful, binder. I suspect I could find a pretty binder, with a plastic cover, far cheaper than this one. Then I could purchase my own dividers and make the system more appropriate to my cooking style.

Most of my standalone recipes are already printed, so I'm not sure I'll use many of them, but I do like 'em. (A small note says that free downloadable PDFs refills are available online.)

Heres my take on it.\n\nThe binder is attractively designed in a William Morris floral print, lime green and two shades of teal on a white background.. Similar matching floral prints adorn the eight pocket dividers categorized as Fruits and Vegetables, Breads and Pasta, Eggs and dairy, Soups and Salads, Meats and Poultry, Fish and Seafood, Desserts, and Beverages. In addition to each section, there are four additional double-sided pages in a heavy weight paper for handwritten recipes (two on the front, one on the back). The binder and prints are lovely and would make a delightful gift for family members with favorite recipes included. However, the binder has limitations for my recipe collection, namely, I do not file my recipes under these headings and theres no section for sauces and marinades or pickles and preserves. I have added additional tabbed sheets for these. Also, the binder is constructed of heavy cardboard that is not impervious to spatters that stain so will need to be stored and used away from the cooking area.\n\nThese shortcomings are overcome-able, but the three ring section that holds the recipe pages is flawed in that theres no tab at the top or bottom to assist in opening the rings to insert more paper. It can only be done with brute force, something difficult for someone with arthritic fingers.\n\nI like the binder idea and wanted to like it more, but these items make it hard to use and not very practical.

The binder contains pre-printed, two-sided recipe sheets for handwriting recipes, and it uses the pocketed dividers as tabs labeling the major kinds of dishes -- everything but appetizers.  The problem, of course, is that in today's high-tech society, we want to print or scan recipes, not go through the laborious process of writing them down by hand.

It's always a challenge to find the ones I need.  So I figured the V&A William Morris Recipe Binder would be a wonderful way to organize my recipes and store them together in one convenient place.\n\nThe binder itself is very attractive, larger than I expected, and very sturdy.  It's basically a three-ring binder with a heavy cardboard cover and eight pocketed dividers organized by type of recipe (i.e. \"Fruits & Vegetables,\" \"Breads & Pasta,\" \"Meats & Poultry,\" etc.).  Recipes can be tucked into the binder pockets or copied onto pre-printed recipe sheets (each of the eight categories includes five of these sheets, printed front and back - each sheet actually provides space for three recipes, one on the front and two on the back).  Inside the front cover of the binder are charts showing \"Food Equivalents,\" \"Liquid Measures,\" and \"Dry Measures\" (showing metric conversions).  Inside the back cover is a \"Roasting Chart,\" and another showing oven temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius.  The William Morris floral patterns used for the cover and the dividers are lovely.\n\nBut is this a convenient way to organize recipes?  Maybe.  The majority of my recipes have been scribbled on pieces of notebook paper, printed from the Internet, or clipped from magazines (some as long ago as forty years!).  I could certainly copy these disintegrating recipes onto the pre-printed recipe sheets in the binder, but I'd like it better if I could type them out, save them, and then print them (the sheets are not formatted in a way that would make this work).  What I plan to do is ignore the pre-printed sheets and just print my recipes out on standard paper, which I can then hole-punch and place into the binder.  But that means a big part of this binder system isn't being used as it was intended.  Please note:  a PDF version of the insert pages is available free of charge from Galison.com, so you can print out unlimited pages; had this not been a PDF file, it would have been possible to type recipes directly into the template, and then print them.  Since it's a PDF file, however, that's not possible.\n\nBasically, this is a fancy-looking three-ring binder with pretty dividers and pre-printed recipe sheets that aren't really necessary.  For less than half the price you could buy a binder and some pocketed dividers, and then set up your own system.  Now that I have this, I will use it.  But I probably wouldn't have purchased it on my own.  It's definitely pretty.  It's just not as practical as it could have been.\n\nUPDATE 1/20/2014:  After working with this a bit, I've found that the categories listed on the dividers don't work all that well for the recipes I collect.  I have a lot of recipes for sauces and marinades, for example, and there is no divider for that.  Additionally, there's no place to put rice dishes or snacks/appetizers.  There's a divider labeled \"Beverages\" which I will not use, so I can re-name it \"Sauces\" -- but that still leaves me with a bunch of recipes with no place to put them.

I love the Dilbert comics and being able to wake up every day and read one in the morning is very enjoyable. It's always good to start your day with a smile. I loved the Dilbert calendars I used for the past couple years.\n\nHowever this years calendar is beyond horrible. It looks like it was designed by a three year old and was then outsourced to China for printing and assembly. I will explain:\n\n1. Craftsmanship - When I got the calendar in the mail, I took it out and tried to set it up. The cover and binder promptly fell off the calendar, it now has the glue backing that the pages are stuck to exposed on the top. Since the calendar attached to the plastic stand with sticky glue on the back cover, the calendar doesn't \"stick\" to the plastic stand anymore, since it only has the glue and pages left.\n\n2. Where's Sunday? - For whatever illogical and inconceivable reason, they removed Sunday from the calendar. They combined the weekends into one page, so now you have pages for \"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat/Sun\". I can't understand why they did this. The whole reason I use page-a-day calendars is because I can never remember what the date or day of the week is. It is only through the habit of removing a page every morning that I have any clue what month/day/year I am living in. I'm serious. I don't keep track of time like other people do. So combining the weekends like this really throws me off.\n\n3. The Font - The old Dilbert calendars had an easy to read font for the date and day of the week. They used a bold black font on a white background, something that everyone is accustomed to and can read easily. Now they have a thinner black font with a white highlight on a lime green background. It actually is harder to read, especially when you wake up in the morning. The obnoxious orange seal on the bottom right of every page with Scott Adams name only adds to the visual aggravation.\n\nTo conclude, the calendar is in almost every way horrible. I love the Dilbert strips, and the strips are the only enjoyable thing about this. I will be shopping around for another page-a-day calendar to use, and probably won't buy another Dilbert one.

I am sure that her estate will keep on producing more calendars and planners, such as this lovely 2013 edition. As usual, each month has an appropriate country or village scene depicting activities from the 19th century. The village scene on the front of the calender is for the month of December, and shows Ms Stocks usual attention to detail. People are shopping, riding in sleighs down snowy streets and up hill sides, the homes and stores are inviting, and a lovely Christmas tree sits in the village square. It is the idealized rural village that continues to have a grasp on the imagination of so many of us, especially when you from time to time find yourself longing for a slower pace of life, even on just a temporary basis. The calendar can bring that to you! I have purchased Ms Nelson's calendars for years, and am never disappointed. I always look forward to her illustration for the month of October, as I believe she must have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of Halloween celebrations, as her picture for that month is always amusing.

Pepper\" is arguably the Beatles most recognized album. Released in 1967 at the peak of the 'hippy/flower power' movement, it combined art with music in a way that no album had previously done. From the way upbeat, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" to the surreal, somewhat somber, \"A Day In The Life\", every song is a classic. The sound is what makes this album amazing. George Martin and his son remastered and remixed several songs for the \"Love\" album. This same remarkable remastering has revitalized \"Sgt. Pepper's\" to an unbelievable clarity. Mixed with an array of sound effects, the remastering not only enhances the instruments and vocals, but brings all those art/music sound effects throughout the album to a vivid height. It's really remarkable how great this album sounds.\n\nAlso included in the great album is a multi-paged booklet with some excellent liner notes. There is also a diagram identifying all the famous people in the cover photo! On your computer, you can play the five-minute mini-documentary about the album (Quick-time), which showcases comments from all four Beatles and George Martin. All of this is mixed in with rare photos never seen before. Imagine learning that this album was recorded at night with over 400 hours devoted to it. That's perfectionism and its shows.

(NUMBER 9, NUMBER 9, NUMBER 9, of course!) So, for those of you who have NEVER bought any of the Beatles CDs, PLEASE WAIT!  The Beatle's music was very late, as far as ALBUM CLASSICS go, for their original CD mastering.  Nothing was released until around 1987, which means the digital quality is  what was current, over 20 years ago. If you compair the digital bit rates, to PIXEL DEPTH of a photograph or TV, then you are compairing a picture of the MONA LISA made from 8 pixels per square inch, with a photo of the Mona Lisa made from 100,000 pixels per square inch. Now, we have that HIGH DEFINITION, 24 bit remastering. All the warmth of Analouge is preserved, with the clarity of digital.  FINALLY the Beatles will release their ENTIRE CATALOUGE remastered. PLUS, each album will have a quick time movie, that shows HOW the album was made, little audio outtakes, etc. PLUS, past masters 1 and 2 are going to be united to ONE CD, and....THE MONO EDITIONS WILL BE RELEASED AS WELL!!!! (Finally, the MONO SGT PEPPER ALBUM, MONO WHITE ALBUM, MONO REVOLVER ALL ON CD!!!!!) OKAY, so now that we know to WAIT until September to buy the SGT PEPPER ALBUM, i just want to put my two cents into the reason why THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER RECORDED.\n\n  Most people have heard so much about the Beatles, and this album, that they have formed an opinion about it, often without ever having heard the album.  This was true back in 1980 with some of my friends, and it's still true today.  Now that this album is 42 years old, you would think it would be at least SOMEWHAT dated. Much from the 60s DOES SOUND dated, but the Beatle's work does not. It truly DOES tap into the eternal beauty of the human soul.  Sgt. Pepper is often credited as the first \"artrock\" album, and first \"Concept album\" as well.  John Lennon used to INSIST that this was a  concept album, without a concept. But the concept is almost TOO SIMPLE to see.  It contains a very obvious concept: THE BANALITY OF MODERN DAY LIFE.  The whole idea of \"Psychedelic music\", was to return \"technicolor\" back to a drab and dreary world, to make the monotony of WORK, HOME, EAT, SLEEP, WAKE UP, WORK, HOME, EAT, SLEEP, or the monotonous rites of passage like, MARRIAGE (when i'm 64), Leaving home (SHE's LEAVING HOME), going to church (WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU), and death (A DAY IN THE LIFE, which talks about the death in a car crash, in warfare, etc.) Either way you look at it, life can be a DRAG, a dull, boring, tedious DRAG. The beatles were really fighting against......A DULL AND BORING LIFE. Each song deals with an aspect of daily life, that artists had tried to elevate the human awareness beyond, especially since the romantic movement, and the rediscovery of mind expanding drugs into our culture.  SGT PEPPERS LONELY HEARTS CLUB, is a song about the isolation of the human experience....we are ALL loney, ALL unable to really connect with the OTHER. BUT, the idea of Psychedelic drugs, was that you could mind merge with your fellow trippers, and become a BAND with each other, and ONE with the universe. SURE, it does sound a bit trite now, a bit pseudo utopian in these days of terrorism, crackheads and meth heads, and DEATH CENTERED video games, which have replaced the hippie idealism. BUT, are we better off SPIRITUALLY today? For that matter, SOCIALLY? Or MATERIALLY? Well, not really.  IN fact, we are closer to this existencial isolation of the human TODAY, than we were 40 years ago.  The Beatles created an album of closely related songs, that examined the Generation Gap, which is really the GAP between the HIP, and the HYPED. How many people today, live a life where they are CONSTANTLY HYPED, into buying a new computer game, iPod, iPhone, etc?  These hypes, are just as empty, and lifeless, as the materialistic hypes from that era.\n\nThis album CHALLENGES YOU to elevate your awareness....not nessacarily with drugs, but with a bigger picture of HOW IT ALL GOES TOGETHER.  Anyone of us, can elevate ourselves like the Beatles did, when they put on the costumes of a typical \"psychedelic San Fransesco hippie Band\", grew out their hair, and studied eastern spirituality, as a way to see that the world is SO MUCH MORE than daily awareness lets us know about. This \"awareness\" was long the priviledge of the artists, but by 1967 EVERYBODY could join the party. Once you joined the \"SGT PEPPER LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND\", and reinvented yourself, you could GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP OF YOUR FRIENDS. (Join a commune, or a meditation group.) ANd, you could see new visions, like LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS. (A childLIKE vision, based on Jesus' saying that no one enters Heaven, unless they become LIKE CHILDREN.)  That is the REAL idea here. Lennon based the song on a child's world, his 7 year old son's drawing of a woman in the stars. Then, once you did this, life would start GETTING BETTER.  If something was raining on your world, making life a drag, instead of complaining, you just go up on the roof, and start FIXING A HOLE. Then, you remove yourself from the world of dull, backward looking people. SHE\"S LEAVING HOME was the parents perspective, of a daughter doing just that....leaving behind parents that controlled her thru guilt (We gave her most of our lives....SURE mom and dad, SURE you did.) THEN, the woman joins the band, and marches right into what Herman Hesse called \"The Circus of the Mind\". And tonight the Circus is FOR THE BENEFIT OF MISTER KITE, as we fly HIGHER and HIGHER into a phasmagorical dreamland, shooting stars twirling into colorful sparks, that you may NEVER want to leave. What does the \"experience\" Teach? George Harrison thought that life always keeps going on, WITHIN YOU AND WITHOUT YOU. (The squares laugh at the end of this song, all about eastern spirituality, complete with sitars, tablas, and the first real visions of GLOBALIZATION applied to a new sound: World music.)  If the album ONLY had George's magnum opus on it, it would STILL be one of the greatest rock songs ever. After you get your head together, with a little help of the CIRCUS of the MIND, and some Transcendental Meditation/eastern Mystisicm, you still had to wonder about what life would be like, in 40 years. Would the lover you have in your youth, love you for MORE than your beauty? Will I be loved WHEN I\"M SIXTY FOUR? Sure, even those people who tried to BE HERE NOW, thought of the future.  Even if you were hip, you STILL had to work, just like LOVELY RITA the Meter maid. (Another strike at the military industrial complex, cos RITA looked a little like a MILITARY MAN.) SURE, you may become aware of the TRUTH,  but you STILL have to get up  tomorrow, and face another day, pour your cornflakes and milk, and say GOODMORNING GOODMORNING to the blahs of the working week. BUT WAIT!! THe circle is always coming around again, as the time comes to meet up with your friends who help you get high, and see the VISIONS again, and again, and again....each day become another DAY IN THE LIFE, until all the days are past, and we DIE. BUT, before we die without knowing that another way of seeing the world exists out there, the Beatles want to do something for you, they would LOVE TO TURN YOU ON!  Oh yes, yes they would, and they STILL  want to do that.  Fourty years later, and i cant think of a SINGLE album that sums up the world, and life, and death, and all the circles within circles we pass thru,  all the stages of life, all the joys, and sorrows, all the boredoms and ecstacies, the way SGT PEPPER does. Is it the BEST music, that the Beatle's recorded? Well, song by song, maybe not. I still like the WHITE ALBUM a bit better, just cos the songs were a bit more centered.  But if ART REFLECTS LIFE, and if LIFE is about the BEAUTIFUL and the DULL, the YIN AND YANG, being BORN again (as a new BAND, or persona), and DYING (to the self, or to the world), then this \"Sgt. Pepper\" world recreats what other poets couldn't achieve thru PAGES and PAGES of obtuse poems meant for the educated, privledged few. NOW, this is a TRUE ART, produced for ALL PEOPLE...and like all TRUE ART, it isn't about the PAST. It's about NOW. BECAUSE THE HUMAN CONDISTION IS ALWAYS THE SAME. WE might decorate our lives a bit differently. Maybe telephones are smaller, or you can watch a million different movies on your BIG SCREEN TV, but its the SAME LIFE, the same people living it.  ONE THING IS FOR SURE....if you think that this was your PARENTS/GRANDPARENTS music, or whatever, then you might as well never listen to MOZART, cos it was your GREAT GREAT GREATx3 GRANDPARENTS MUSIC, or not listen to the sitar, because its music for somebody else's ancestors. If we have REALLY come to the point, where we cant find TRUTH, BEAUTY and ENLIGHTENMENT unless it comes packaged as a BRAND NEW VIDEO GAME, which needs a $300 new control unit, and a $75 program, and a $800 HI DEF TV screen, then I really feel sorry for the world today, and the kids coming up. BECAUSE, for the price of a MOVIE, this album gives you MORE ENTERTAINMENT, than a hundred video games, which grow old, as soon as the next version comes out in a couple of years, or a new RAP star, who also becomes old, as soon as the newer face comes on the scene. SGT PEPPER has a message. Yes, we are ALL UNITED, by our COMMUNAL LIFE DRAMAS, DISAPPOINTMENTS, DREAMS, and VISIONS.  It is the voice of the ETERNAL SHAMAN, and if we no longer listen to THAT voice, then life IS A DRAG.\n\nIf you are just TOO COOL, and TOO KNOWLEDGABLE to get into this CD, cos you know ALL ABOUT WHAT IT IS, even if you never heard it, then you are very closed minded. OPEN YOUR MIND. As for the music on this album, it is every bit as fresh now, as when it was made. MUSIC PRODUCERS to this day have no idea how all this sound got onto a 4 track tape.  It should sound as lo-fi as Half Japanese. Instead, there is so much happening, that you could listen to it all your life, and NEVER hear everything. BECAUSE GREAT ART CHANGES WITH YOU, and renews itself WITH YOU, because its part of the ETERNAL CHANGING NOW.  And, if you need ANY MORE PERSUASION, just wait until SEPT 9th, 2009, and hear the NEW REMASTERING. AMAZON.com aren't placing pre-orders yet, but as soon as they do, I'm there.

I was similarly bowled over by Joe Cocker's (slower) version of this composition which he sang live at Woodstock.\n\nBrian Wilson of The Beach Boys, who was so impressed with Sgt.

The Beatles were at their height. In the U. S., it was before the assassinations of Malcolm X, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King when all the world seemed young and everything was possible. It was more than just world class music, it was a social and cultural phenomenon. There had never been anything just quite like it before. It helped define the 1960's.\n\nThe music of course is of one cloth as each song seques into the next one. No song stands out above another although my favorite has always been \"When I'm Sixy-four.\" It now has a poignancy that we never dreamed of in those our salad days since neither George Harrison or John Lennon lived to see sixty-four. Then there was a whole generation of men, many who grew up with the Beatles, who perished in the first wave of AIDS.\n\nBesides the marvelous music, there is of course the artwork for the album/CD. According to the liner notes by Peter Blake, he asked the Beatles for a list of people they would want at an imaginary concert. John initially wanted to include Jesus, Ghandi and Hitler but eventually left all three off the list because of the controversy in the U. S. over his recent comment about Jesus. Some of the people who made the list were Marlene Dietrich, Shirley Temple, Marlon Brando, Bob Dylan, Dylan Thomas, Edgar Allen Poe, Tony Curtis, William Burroughs, Karl Marx, Oscar Wilde, Johnny Weismuller, Stephen Crane, Albert Einstein, and Mae West (who refused at first but eventually agreed to be included in the life-size collage.)\n\nIt is impossible to write about either popular music or the popular culture of the last half of the twentieth century without a discussion of this CD.

Pepper' should be viewed as their most creative and ground-breaking album.  However, as great as it is, it isn't, subjectively, their best.\n\nThe false start and the blaring guitars that herald the album with a show tune accompanied by able brass is certainly an ear opener even today.  It starts out the show, a carnival, but it does have some side shows as well.  There are segues throughout, and the special effects elevated The Beatles to the stature of artists in a way only looked at in retrospect on 'Revolver' and 'Rubber Soul'  (Thankfully, the latter classics have in some ways surpassed 'Pepper''s reputation.)  \"With a Little Help from My Friends,\" one of the very best songs on the album, melds in with the title song and is still one of their best pop classics of all time.  While \"Lucy in the Skies with Diamonds\" and \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\" continue the carnival perfection, they also date the album somewhat.  Some of the other highlights of the album include \"When I'm Sixty Four,\" with the beginning of Paul's stretch of vaudevillian numbers.  Then, \"Lovely Rita\" is ethereal and entertaining.  John is quite able to lift the veil off the conventional world with \"Good Morning, Good Morning\" (based on a Kellogg's Corn Flake Commercial).  Just before the tent folds up, The Beatles deliver the better and more fluid reprise to \"Sgt. Pepper\" just before they end with a remarkable finale.\n\nAll The Beatles try to showcase a new consciousness with songs like Paul's \"Getting Better\" and \"Fixing a Hole\".  George gets his turn with the deep, spiritual realm of \"Within You and Without You\".  (And, while it is sincere, articulate, and perceptive, it doesn't fit the album musically as well as \"Love You To\" does on 'Revolver'.)  Paul certainly adds depth with his contribution \"She's Leaving Home,\" almost a classical piece with tear-jerking lyrics and a story that challenges class differences like 'Lady Chatterly's Lover'.  The finale, \"A Day in the Life,\"  is the most celebrated song.  It is the grandest musically and lyrically transcending the ordinary values of life.  The song remains innovative and awe-inspiring.\n\nOverall, The Beatles brought the most innovations to pop music on 'Sgt. Pepper'.  The music is meant to rise above conventional consciousness.  In this sense it can be regarded as a concept album that has some diversions along the way.  Still, 'Sgt. Pepper' is a period piece, one that is magnificent, but is their most dated.  It does come from 1967 and, for better or worse, seems locked in time.  They abandoned the drugs and the magical studio effects, but went ahead later with 'The White Album,' another masterpiece that is more decidedly rock, but without much compromise.

For the first time, Rock music was capable of being more than mere dance music -- it was to be listened to and digested.  Where the Beatles first album took 10 hours to record, this took 700 hours and 129 days.  The sound of every instrument is in some way altered:  instruments and voices are compressed, limited, and echoed.  Violins were recorded by taking headphones and using them as microphones.

This was the the first \"concept album\" where the songs on each side of the vinyl did not have pauses between them.  Thank you Sir George Martin!\nThe songs themselves are very good.  The last song on the album, \"A Day in the Life,\" is John Lennon's materpiece.  The title song, Sgt. Peppers, etc., is one of Paul's niftiest pieces.  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, is a great psychedelic song which we thought described an LSD trip.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is, in my opinion, the most historically important album ever released.  This album revolutionized the rock and roll industry; often imitated but never duplicated, it continues to exert a significant influence on the very business of singing and recording music.  Even the timing of the album was perfect; the year was 1967, the Summer of Love, and this album captured the spirit of the times in such an amazing fashion that other recording artists immediately recognized the profound significance of what the Beatles had just succeeded in doing.  I remember seeing an interview with David Crosby, who basically said that Sgt. Pepper accomplished what he and so many other artists of that war-torn generation had been trying to achieve themselves - musically, artistically, and culturally.\nThere had never been an album like Sgt. Pepper's before 1967.  Before then, an album was simply a collection of songs; since Sgt. Pepper's, an album has been looked upon as more than the sum of its parts.  The Beatles were determined to break new ground, putting in an estimated 700 hours in the studio to produce the thirteen songs you find here (three additional songs were also recording during the Sgt. Pepper sessions but went on to be released separately: Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, and It's Only a Northern Song) .  The amazing stereo sound was borne of carefully placed microphones all over the studio, including the insides of instruments.  All manner of mixing, tape speed manipulation, and other elaborate technological twists were done to the recordings to make each of them sound unlike anything ever heard before.  There were no breaks between songs, so each side of the original long-playing record played without pausing from beginning to end.  In the case of the second side, you could even say that there was no end to the music; John Lennon, after adding several seconds of a high-pitched tone near the end of A Day in the Life, had several seconds of inane chatter stuck at the very end - this chatter played over and over again in one continuous groove until the listener lifted the needle (unless the record player featured auto return).  The historic evolution of the album went far beyond the individual song tracks.  The album cover, featuring a gallery of familiar men and women is famous in and of itself - as much for those individuals who were rejected as too controversial as it is for the faces you do see (many of whom had to be paid for the use of their likenesses).  Sgt. Pepper was also the first album to come with the lyrics of the songs printed on the sleeve.\nYou can already see the importance of this album, and I haven't even discussed the song selection yet.  What's to say, really, when every single track is a classic?  The title track gets the music off to a rousing start before bridging smoothly into With a Little Help From My Friends featuring Ringo on lead vocals.  Then you have John's remarkable Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.  Paul jumps out front on Getting Better, Fixing a Hole, and She's Leaving Home, followed up by John on Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite.  The next track is the most unusual song on the album: George Harrison's Within You Without You.  At first, this song - with its Oriental, psychedelic sound - doesn't seem to fit in with the surrounding songs, but all it takes is a couple of listens to see just how important the track is to the album itself.  Next comes Paul with the jaunty When I'm Sixty-Four, followed by Lovely Rita, the most entertaining and enjoyable song on the album in my opinion.  After John says Good Morning, Good Morning, the band is back for a reprise of the title track and an encore of sorts in the form of A Day in the Life, a particularly unusual track that changes drastically in terms of sound and singer midway through.\nIt is hard to do justice to this album in words; as important and influential as it is enjoyable to listen to over and over again, Sgt.

Teenagers had been buying rock'n'roll records since Bill Haley and the  Comets released `Rock Around The Clock.' But the 60's decade was different:  never before had there been so many kids with so much cash (economists call  it `disposable income'). Teenagers bought fast cars, fast food and millions  of those black vinyl things.\nThe one commonality of all Baby Boomers was  the War in Vietnam. Teenagers were either waiting to go to Vietnam, in  Vietnam, coming home from Vietnam (perhaps), or doing their damnedest to  stay out of Vietnam. The War was an American invention, and so was  rock'n'roll. Teenagers denounced everything institutional and embraced  anything foreign. The British Invasion, led by the Beatles, was scarcely an  invasion at all: it was a welcoming party given by the Baby Boomers. The  Beatles were at the right place at the right time. Sure Sgt. Pepper was the  art album of the decade, but more importantly it was the Great Escape. One  could understand the assignation of President Kennedy `With A Little Help  From My Friends.' `When I'm Sixty-Four' was an optimistic ditty if your  draft number was 1,000 and they had just called 999. `A Day In The Life'  was an ideal way to reflect on America's greatest (and dead) civil rights  leader - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. If you were unfortunate enough to have  suffered the Tet Offensive, `Lovely Rita' (your girl back in the world) was  the only thing that kept you going. And lastly, `Good Morning Good Morning'  was a sardonic greeting shouted by police during the Democratic National  Convention in Chicago. Sgt. Pepper defined a generation? Nonsense. The  generation defined Sgt. Pepper.", "summary": "Defined by a generation", "unixReviewTime": 953424000}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "2", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2014", "reviewerID": "A1QPUBF6U5EQM6", "asin": "0769653669", "style": {"Format:": " Paperback"}, "reviewerName": "Dare2Dream", "reviewText": "I'm a homeschool Mom with a 6th grade child who is on the spectrum.

But, if you want to jot a few brief notes, the boxes will be adequate. All public holidays are well-marked, and  the day page is a soothing on the eye beige-type color. The prints and etchings surrounding the edges of the pages are very evocative of the Edwardian, and even the Victorian period. There is not much Art Deco to be seen here., although Downton certainly approaches that period.\n\nThe pages and the pictures for each month are enormous. The pictures of each month do not necessarily reflect the month shown,  and are lacking in explanations of the scene being shown. Of course if you are a Downton fan, you will very well know what each picture represents., but others, who buy the calendar to evoke a certain period in time, and a way of life that is long gone, might appreciative a few informative sentences explaining the happenings represented on each month's picture.\n\nThe photography is glorious. The paper stock used, is of high-quality, and each calendar page itself is very cute, and very quaint, this is not a grand calendar, in the Downton tradition, this imparts more of a cozy feeling, and it would definitely have been displayed downstairs, and not upstairs at Downton itself.\n\nSo, it is a bit confusing, the grand, very grand annd imposing picture of Downtom on the calendar cover, the very cute, and  the very well-chosen patterns, colors and arrangements of the calendar pages themselves. But, the photographs for each month are really not that exciting, indeed are a bit lackluster when  considering all of the drama and excitement that could have been represented in the pictures, and there really should be some text added to explain the occurrences in the pictures to non-Downton  fans.\n\nSo, a nice calendar of good quality, well-worth the price, but a bit let down by the less than exciting pictures on each day of the month. A Downton fan will love it, others, maybe not.\n\nThe price is surprisingly moderate, considering the run-away best seller that is the series, the quality is high, and it will look particularly nice hung  in a homey or old-fashioned kitchen.

We are trying to get advice/feedback from different sources regarding the framing, but if we do not get that, we expect to proceed with trying the dry-mounting since the map is so inexpensive , especially compared to the cost of framing it, and we could buy a replacement if the heat of the dry-mount process ruins the laminated map.

On the front of the card is a simple \"Thank You\" in the lower right corner and inside they are blank. Being blank on the inside leaves you the entire card to write a message. The cards come in a plastic holder so that you don't have to worry about the cards being loose and getting messed up. The cards are made from card stock paper that has a slight texture. The back flap of the envelope might seem odd to mention here but there are two things about this flap I wanted to point out. First, the flat is not the typical triangle/pointed design but more of a rounded rectangle. I think this gives the card a more expensive look. Second, the flap is self sticking! You peel off the strip and stick it down. This is a wonderful feature to add to these cards! These are quality cards and have the look of expensive, boutique cards.\n\nThese came just in time because we have a birthday party soon and will need them!

Plus, this is a set of 10 pencils, without a nice solid tin box, so the coloring book becomes even pricier, doesn't it?\n\nIf you just color just for enjoyment, then you won't mind the fact that pages are printed on both sides.  If you color to create frame-able artwork, you will definitely mind that you can see the shadow of the black ink from the backside of your work shining through.....

It includes foxes, owls, stags, birds, cows, sheep, rabbits, squirrels and more. The designs are drawn with firm, dark outlines and are made extra fun to color with enlivening doodles throughout the animals.  There are a number of geometric, sort of wall paper designs and a few fun challenges (mazes, areas to color yourself, etc.) which makes the book a little bit of an activity book as well as a coloring book.\n\nThe designs in this book are printed on both sides of white medium weight, non-perforated paper. The binding is glued rather than sewn (which is unusual for a coloring book from the UK.) Many of the designs merge into the binding and some portion of them will be lost if you cut the pages from the book. I could not break the spine enough to get the book to lay flat.  This could be a problem with designs that merge into the binding.\n\nThirteen of the designs spread across two pages.  In my book, the pages were not aligned well.  It seems to be a printing issue rather than an alignment issue.  I found that the elements at the center of the each side of the binding doubled slightly.  That left me with a design that could not be aligned properly. This may be particular to my book or it may be a general issue.  I am thinking a more general issue as the images were sized a particular way rather than printed improperly on the page.\n\nBecause of this alignment issue, the problems with trying to get the book to lay flat, and because most coloring medium bled through the paper, I detracted a star from my rating.  The designs are absolutely five star but the execution of the printing and the paper had problems.  I still like my coloring book and will certainly color the single page designs.\n\nI test all of my coloring books with a wide variety of coloring mediums.  I will list those at the bottom of this review.  This is what my test results were:\n\nAll alcohol-based markers bled through this paper easily.  The water-based markers either bled through or left a distinct color shadow at the back of the page.  My India ink artist pens also left a shadow at the back of the page.  My gel pens left a shadow of indistinct color on the back of the page.  All of my coloring pencils performed fantastic. The book is published by Derwent and is supposed to be especially good with Derwent Coloursoft pencils.  I found that Prismacolor Premier Soft Core and Faber-Castell Polychromos worked just as well on this paper.  My hard lead Prismacolor Verithins laid down nicely and did not leave a dent on the back of the page.\n\nThese are the coloring medium that I use for testing. If there is something else you feel I should be testing, please let me know and I will see if I can add it to my growing pile:\n\nMarkers: 1) alcohol-based  Copic Sketch, Prismacolor double ended markers (brush and fine point), Sharpies (fine and ultra-fine) Bic Mark-its (fine and ultra-fine) and 2) water-based  Tombows dual end markers (brush and fine point), Stabilo 88, and Staedler triplus fineliners\n\nIndia Ink:  Faber-Castell PITT artist pens (brush tip)\n\nGel Pens:  Sakura, Fiskars, Uni-ball Signo in the following sizes - 0.28/0.38/0.5/1.0 and Tekwriter\n\nColoring Pencils:  Prismacolor Premier Soft Core, Derwent Colorsoft, Prismacolor Verithins, and Faber-Castell Polychromos", "summary": "Beautiful Hand-drawn Designs of English Wildlife but with printing and alignment issues  printed on both sides of the page", "unixReviewTime": 1456617600}, {"image": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Ocmtwl0rL._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sxXV4+t9L._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811Llx754vL._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819Y8oDs-xL._SY88.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Tia9W9kjL._SY88.jpg"], "overall": 4.0, "vote": "6", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2016", "reviewerID": "A26BU3ZU0R5IPF", "asin": "099337980X", "style": {"Style:": " Book"}, "reviewerName": "~*~ Sunshine ~*~", "reviewText": "This adult coloring book contains 89 single pages that you can color plus the inside covers could also be colored, though they have a different, shiner finish.  The drawings vary between intricate, geometrically patterned animal figures and designs and those that are less so, but all could be considered challenging enough to keep one occupied for many, many days.  The many, different patterns encourage you to create and experiment with your own individual color schemes and result in finished projects that are unique to each \"artist\".\n\nI enjoyed the information, examples, and the tutorial in the front of the book.  I didn't so much care for the interactive pages of finishing your own drawings, mazes, or the object searches.  I believe that some of the searches are incorrect as I couldn't find all of the objects in the tadpole/frog search, and I looked and counted numerous times.  Fortunately, there aren't that many of these distractions, and you can color the page, finished or not.\n\nThe pages are all of a heavy white stock and are printed on both sides.  Most all of the drawings are made up of small spaces that are best colored with pencils.  I also purchased some sets of Prismacolor pencils when I ordered this book.  They work quite well but are expensive compared to standard brands of color pencils.  I am happy with both book and pencils but fight the thought that I'm \"wasting time\" while feeling rather unproductive coloring.  I do have a sense of satisfaction when I see the finished pictures, or even the colored individual parts, as it takes a lot of time to finish an entire page!\n\nIf you are creative and like drawings of plants, insects, and animals in nature, I think you would enjoy this book.  If you want simple drawings that you can color quickly with crayons, pencils, or markers, this probably isn't the book for you.

No wonder I am always changing my Facebook password. I just KNOW that there have been times when I have put in the correct password several times and when I put it in to change it they tell me that it was the previous password. Who can remember all these different passwords and not to forget that passwords are \"Case Sensitive,\" which just means that when you put in the 15 digit password, don't forget that the third T is a Capital T, because if you put a lower case \"t\" your password WILL be rejected and you will have to start all over again. So after seeing a couple of password books on Amazon, I decided to breakdown and get one. The first one was so big that I had nowhere to put it. I no longer use my laptop and always use the iPad, so I wanted something small enough to put on the table next to my chair. The next one I ordered was the size of a pad of deposit slips with cheap paper cover and four entries for each letter of the alphabet with X,Y and Z sharing four. Ridiculous! I found this one and looked at the dimensions and decided try try this one and kept my fingers crossed.\n\nI got it right on the third try. It is a bit smaller than a paperback. There are a few pages in the front giving you tips on creating a password. There are almost 150 pages with 3 entry sections on each page and several pages in the back just for notes. There is a magnetized flap that keeps the book closed and room for a pen storage. This book has just what I was looking for and if it was sitting on a table it DOES NOT scream Password Keeper. There is only one thing wrong and the rest is so right that I will find a way to work it out, but I did take off one star because that might be very important for some people. There are no alphabetical sections. There is no tabs with letters on them and I really can't figure out why because there are plenty of pages separate into sections for each letter, so you will have to make the determination, what is the criteria most important to you.

Each book takes a different facet, even a different point of view, of early California.  Also, the writing is very age appropriate and easy to read. (California history is the fourth grade curriculum in California). Every page is colored, and every page has a lot of illustrations, usually drawings but also some photographs.

Setup it simple: 1) unplug your Echo. 2) Plug the power cable from the Ecoboot into the Echo. 3) Squeeze the Echo down into the boot. 4) Plug the Echo's original cable into the boot.\n\nAfter you let it charge, you can unplug your Echo and walk around your house with it. Of course, you need to stay in range of your wifi because the Echo has no onboard storage, but as long as you do you'll be able to use the Echo's full functionality.\n\nI've used this for:\nMoving my Echo into my kitchen to listen to music while the family watch TV.\nTaking the Echo out onto the patio.\nTaking the Echo to my basement so I can listen to news while I'm reorganizing all the junk.\n\nAlso, if you use your Echo for your morning alarm, this gives you a back up against a possible power spike (I don't use this function, but some people do, and it's nice to know you're not going to be late for work).\n\nA couple of things I would point out: the Echo is a tight squeeze into the base. And if you don't get it a just so, the Echo will sit a little off kilter. Because this adds a few inches of height to the Echo it also makes it more apparent if its sitting at an angle. So, you may find yourself needing to finagle it a bit.\n\nIt is not a perfect match for the finish. If you get right up close to you and really look at it, you can tell it's aftermarket. That being said, this doesn't bother me at all because kind of the point of a voice-assistant is that you *don't* need to get right up close to it and really inspect it.\n\nI haven't had a chance to do a battery run down. I started one a couple of times by putting the volume at 5 and telling having the Echo just play non-stop music.

The other stuff in the handle is a bonus.\n\nI've had several multi-function tools with pliers before, and eventually you ask more of the pliers than what they are capable of doing. Next thing you know, the pliers have been torqued way out of alignment. These pliers are very robust and could be used effectively to turn a stubborn nut or pipe. It's because of the way they're shaped into the hammer head, because the hammer head needs some steel in it to be useful. But also because of the shape, the pliers are going to be best for nuts or pipe that fit into the rounded jaws. Anything too small for the rounded jaws and you'll have to use the flat part of the pliers. Any nut over 5/8\" and I think you'll find yourself with an awkward bite and handhold. Fully closed, the aperture is 3/8\". At full open, the aperture is 1\". Btw, the pliers are perfect for tightening your car battery posts, old style and new.\n\nThe tool is equipped with a windshield breaker head which makes it a good choice for the glove box.

I expect them to hold their shape for a long time.\nI used Caran D'Ache Neocolor 2 water soluble wax pastels to test the brush's functionality in the field. I love the convenience of the brush carrying its own water! I tried two methods of painting with these, first drawing with the pastel and going over it with the brush, which worked but was too wet for my liking. Better was picking up the color from the end of the pastel with the brush. This allowed me to have both the color intensity I desired and to dilute as needed. To clean the brush when changing colors was super easy; just squeeze a bit of water through the tip a couple of times and you're good to go. The caps snap on tight and stay put, no concerns about leaking. They come in clear plastic case for transport and storage. I highly recommend these brushes.\nI received a discount when buying this set, for my honest, unbiased opinion.

They are easy to fill up and once they are closed, they don't leak. You do have to make sure to tighten them after filling. There is a place on the barrel that says \"Push\" and you push gently on that area to get the water flowing. I would recommend having a separate piece of paper on the side to test that on first because it will give you a big drop of water the first time. After that, you don't have to push continually to keep the water flowing. These will give you a good amount of water so be sure to color on paper that is able to handle that or it will get wrinkled fairly quickly. The only thing I wish they had was a way to adjust how much water comes out because sometimes I only want a little bit of water. For those times, I sometimes push out a drop of water and empty the tip a bit and use that, because the brush will flow for awhile before you have to push on it again. If they could add a twist valve so you could reduce the flow of water, that would make them even better. I've seen that other people fill them with watercolor pigment, but I use them exclusively with my watercolor pencils so I only use them with plain water.\n\nThe bristles are nylon so they aren't going to give you the same feel as a good sable watercolor brush, meaning they are good for making strokes and pulling water across the colored pencil lines, but you won't be able to get circle shapes like with a good watercolor brush. But, for the price, you really can't expect that. You can get a nice stroke with these and because the bristles are a bit stiff, they are good for doing shading work because they hold straight so that you can so soft back and forth strokes to add a bit of water to pencil strokes and get shading. If the bristles were too soft, you couldn't do that. The brushes do have a nice point to them and because they come in three different sizes, you can do some detail work with the smaller brush.\n\nThese are also fun to use with lettering because you can use the pencils to get all your typography just like you want and then use a light touch with the small pen along the strokes to get a cool painted effect with your lettering. This will be fun when making handmade cards for people and signage for my gallery. Too many ideas of ways to use these!\n\nWhile using them, you will notice that the bristles will pick up the color of the pencils you are using, but that doesn't transfer to other areas one you are done with one color. And they cleaned up fine with a little bit of hand soap. It says they are dishwasher friendly, but I haven't needed to do more than quickly hand wash them to keep them clean. The bristles are nylon so they aren't really prone to much staining. And even if they stain a bit, it doesn't affect how well they work.\n\nI've left these half full in the bag where I keep all my colored pencils and they haven't leaked at all. They do come with a nice pouch to hold them, but if you're like me and sometimes just toss them in a bag, they won't leak as long as you keep the lids on them. And the lids snap on top when you are using them so it's easy to keep them on hand and not lose them.\n\nI have another watercolor brush pen that I got last year and it was more than half the cost of this set, so they are a good value. And these are a bit thicker and heavier than the other one I have so they feel better in my hand and feel like they'll last longer. The other one is still working, but I wanted some different sizes and this set offered that.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with these and will have fun painting with them.

I like the wrap around heating element for even cooking, but that slight extra capacity is really nice because I can use a slightly larger cut or amount of meat and more vegetables and still have space. I also like that it doesn't have that steam vent hole because I hate those things. Your cooking progress is partially track-able because as the time lapses the light for the lower time frame lights up. So if you start at 8 hours the 8 hour light is on, then when there is under 6 hours left the 6 hour light comes on, and so on. But unless you remember exactly what time you started you don't know exactly where you are within the 2 hour increment. It's not that much of a huge deal but a countdown timer that lets you set exactly the hours and minutes you want (instead of committing to 2 hour increments) and shows exactly how much time is left would be even better. That plus one of those latching lids that Hamilton Beach has on some other models of slow cookers would make it pretty much perfect, if more expensive. The price is so low there's room for the cost of improved features as an upgraded model.\n\nThe Cuisinart still looks nice, but I really like being able to add the extra vegetables and meat and still have that comfortable 1/2 inch of space from the top of the food to the top of the crock for cooking space, so I'm still glad to have this one instead.", "summary": "Great smaller programmable slow cooker", "unixReviewTime": 1326931200}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "7", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2011", "reviewerID": "A3DEI17SKJNC9S", "asin": "1439716048", "style": {"Format:": " Kitchen"}, "reviewerName": "Erik Smith", "reviewText": "It's a good pot: heavy enough, heats evenly, and made in the U.S.A., which is a nice plus.

None of the locals had the Panasonic that I wanted, so I went with the Samsung HP-R5072.  I had the Samsung for 20 days before I returned it and purchased the Panasonic TH50PX500.\n\nAll-in-all, the picture on the Samsung had a good picture, but it did not have near the picture clarity and color vibrance that the Panasonic has.  Additionally, this Samsung model has and \"electronic program guide\" - not to be confused withe the \"TV GUIDE\" version.  Needless to say, the Samsung version did not work and requires each channel to transit their program information and that just does not happen.  The Panasonic TH50PX500 does have the \"TV Guide\" version and it worked great.  Finally, the split screen cabability and integration capability with other Panasonic products put the Panasonic over the top when compared to the Samsung.  One last thing, the Samsung remote is very minimal as far as capability goes.  Panasonic has this beat hands down.\n\nThe opinions found here are totally mine and were not influenced in any manner resulting from the discounted or free product.

At that time, I bought a large number of them (several dozens) because I was afraid that they would stop making them since Moleskine was still a small company.  Recently, my supply ended and I bought a few more.  I was disappointed because the quality of the paper was not the same as the original.  I tried a couple of alternatives and did not like them (I hated Rhodia paper because it's too glossy and I thought that Leuchtturm's index pages were annoying).  I concluded that the best option was to use Moleskine sketchbooks because their thicker paper is nice.  However, they are pricey. Last week, I decided to try the Essentials Notebook.  I am very impressed.  The paper is better than the current regular Moleskine notebook and more similar to the original.  The binding, cover, etc., are very similar to the Moleskine.  And their price is significantly lower.  I still think that the Moleskine sketchbook is a better option in terms of paper quality but it has its disadvantages besides the price (fewer pages and it might be too much for someone who only uses it for notes).

It will tuck nicely into any little nook or cranny available where you can keep track of the days with a good laugh or two.\n\nMr. Hilburn never fails to make me laugh -- his ideas, drawings, thoughts, are so funny and yet so down-to-earth and easy to related to.  When I worked, I cannot tell you how many times I would bring in a page that reminded me of a friend or a work situation.  His characters on each page are so well drawn and detailed.  Some of them make me laugh all day long.  And that's what it is all about.\n\nNot only do you get a laugh-a-day cartoon page each day, but on the back of that page is a nifty item called THE DAILY EXTRA.  These consist of bonuses -- puzzles, jokes, lists, quotes, life tips and trivia.  Each calendar page is in color and bright and eye-catching.  The cartoon is to the left -- on the right there is a white open area where you could easily jot down appointments, birthdays, events, and then below that is the day of the week, the numbered day of the month and the month itself.  Like stated earlier, the cartoons are so well drawn down to the finest detail and SO funny.\n\nIf you are looking for the perfect calendar that will make your day, keep you on track regarding the actual day and date, and add some color and laughs to your life, this is the one for you for 2018.\n\nScott Hilburn never disappoints  ARGYLE SWEATER is the ONLY day-to-day calendar I will purchase!", "summary": "LOVE THIS DAY-TO-DAY CALENDAR and SCOTT HILBURN", "unixReviewTime": 1501113600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2017", "reviewerID": "A3HOMO4DUXO88J", "asin": "1449481760", "style": {"Format:": " Calendar"}, "reviewerName": "Wind Song", "reviewText": "Thank you!", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1504051200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2017", "reviewerID": "A1ILA25D9W6ASF", "asin": "1449481760", "style": {"Format:": " Calendar"}, "reviewerName": "Skyeisle", "reviewText": "I buy these Mary E products every year for myself and for certain relatives and friends because she so artfully evokes goodness and innocence with her illustrations, wise reminders and quotes.

The homeschool planner market is chock full of gorgeous planners with zillions of lovely pages to use for journaling, book lists, inspiration, cute quotes, daily plans, long term plans, short term plans and every other possible page you can think of.  Keeping up the planners can be a full time job\n\nThis planner doesn't have that.  This is about as straight forward a record book as you could find.  It is for use by your student.  There is one page for basic identification and grade information.  There is one page to list the general syllabus for each course.  There is one page to list the texts used for each subject.  And then, there are 180 pages designed to record all your academic activities for each day.  Every possible category is listed in a way that encourages you to look not just at typical assigned seatwork but also at activities and field trips.  One page for one day.  There is nothing else to this book.  I wouldn't really want anything else except perhaps space for a reading record.\n\nIf you want a beautiful planner with inspirational quotes and lots of sections keep looking.  If you want a simple straight forward planner that will help with excellent record keeping by you and your student- get this one.

Now that I have started using this, I don't need to wait any longer to tell you how wonderful it is. The best feature is that this has you look forward in setting goals, then review backward to see where you stand. I am the world's top procrastinator and scatter-brain. Using this the last few days is training me how to manage time and goals. It's very motivating to look at the big picture (6 months ahead), then narrow your focus to a weekly and more specific daily agenda. I wish I had had this when I was working a hectic job. The whole general-to-specific works perfectly with the look-forward/review-backwards concept, This really is brilliant.\n\nI've fallen into the habit of using phone apps for just about everything, but they are great for someone like me who can be kind of unorganized and manic about projects. I needed something I can hold and refer to more easily. This is better than any other planner/organizer I have used. Keep in mind that because this is not your usual planner, you have to take a little bit of time to get familiar with it. There is online info for using it and it's well worth every minute to check it out. I have never liked a planner this much so I'll try to just list the standouts.\n\nBest things about this:\n1. High-quality materials. The paper is great to write on with pen or pencil (I always use pencil) without bleed-through. The hardback cover feels amazing; it's a creamy, smooth texture that feels good in the hand & is easy to grip. The binder is made so that you can spread the planner flat without breaking the outer binding. That's genius, especially for those of us who will be using this to the fullest. (Don't overlook the pocket at the back of the planner, btw.)\n2. I can see how it will help me not only stay organized but also focuses on some current goals and projects. I don't always procrastinate out of bad habit; sometimes I just get overwhelmed with a project because I can't organize it easily. This should be perfect for that. (I'm working on a book and will be primarily using this or that and for health tracking.\n3. This planner does not just assume your occupation. You can use this one for your duties whether you are a parent, student, worker-from-home or, like me, a creative person. Every other planner I've used focused on one primary area of my life - usually work. I needed something like this that takes into account that I have LOTS to track and need help focusing.\n\nMy favorite sections are the ones to plan and review. I also like the Daily Priorities and Notes & Ideas. I love that this fits in smaller spaces like my purse or backpack. It's possible to just hand-carry this without it being in the way.\n\nLike I said, this is not a planner you can just pick up and start using; you have to check the instructions first. Because of the way this planner is set up, I'm going to be getting one for my niece (who is a mom and a realtor).\n\nOnce I've used this for a month or so, I will try to come back and update with any more observations.", "summary": "Plan forward & review back  **UPDATE**", "unixReviewTime": 1518912000}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "2", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 12, 2018", "reviewerID": "A7VEAGT195RZ6", "asin": "1465077588", "style": {"Size:": " Regular-used"}, "reviewerName": "Shahania", "reviewText": "I love the set up of the notebook and the whole aesthetic , I only wish there were more notes pages and that the paper were thicker, almost all my pens fully ghost through the pages.\n\nAlso notes for creatives who like to decorate/glam up their planner, this planner is pretty small and crammed by the layout, so would not recommend if you want to use Washi tape/sticky notes/etc. this is for the minimalists.", "summary": "Recommended for most!", "unixReviewTime": 1518393600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2018", "reviewerID": "A1EJPXLTO6N308", "asin": "1465077588", "style": {"Size:": " Regular-used"}, "reviewerName": "Birdie", "reviewText": "This is truly a great planner.

Inside the box was two color fans, one \"Solid Coated\" and one \"Solid Uncoated\".  They were wrapped in clear plastic to protect them.  Upon handling them, you notice that the paper they are printed on is pretty thin.  You have to be a little careful handling them because they could easily get wrinkled.  This is probably due to the huge number of colors that are included.  Heavier paper would make the fans much less portable, so you have a little trade-off between more colors or heavier paper.  Overall, it was a nice looking set with a lot of color variety.\n\n Use - As I mentioned before, you need to be a little careful handling the fans.  The top and bottom of each fan has a heavier card that acts as a protective cover.  The pages of the fan slide very smoothly and are easy to work with and use.  It really has a lot of color variety.  It has a really helpful index in the middle of the fan that lists the Pantone color and the page you can find it on.  My wife was able to find a specific blue color that she used on a client's brochure in a matter of seconds using the index.  Flipping through the many pages of blue shades would have taken a lot longer.  That was a great feature and she was really happy to see it.  There was also an additional lighting indicator page that had a brown swatch that was made up of two different swatches.  If they look the same, you have good lighting.  If they look different, your lighting is bad.  It was another interesting little bonus.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, the Pantone GP1401 Formula Guide is a very expensive purchase, but does a necessary job.  It is common to have a color on your computer screen look completely different than the final printed product, and this type of color guide is absolutely critical to have in that situation.  Even though this set is a little delicate because of the thin paper, it is really due to the huge number of colors that would become much less portable with heavier paper stock.  If you are looking for a good set of Pantone color swatches, this one is worth consideration.", "summary": "What You Should Know Before You Buy!", "unixReviewTime": 1379635200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2013", "reviewerID": "AH4CJ7FEFV761", "asin": "1590652681", "reviewerName": "partyparty", "reviewText": "Pantone makes many different versions and you need to be careful that you buy the correct one you need.

The cover us a hard cover that has a slightly textured material (washable with damp cloth). The cover is hard and sturdy with an elastic closure.\n\n* Dividers A to Z on pages...easy to use, in my opinion.\n\n* Quality of paper is OK, I would liked to see a bit thicker paper. This is the one thing I did not like.\n\n* Special features....my favorites...a closing band to kept this book closed in my purse. It is PINK!\n\nMy suggestions:\n\nFor this low price, this is a wonderful and attractive phone book. The one thing that is not great is the paper is a bit thin. Other than that, I give this 4.6 stars rounded off to 5 stars.

I highly recommend it!  The price is less than on the maker's website, and it arrived in 2 days thanks to Amazon Prime.  The map has a nice heavy lamination on front and back and it arrived in perfect condition, rolled, wrapped in a custom plastic sleeve, and shipped inside a very sturdy cardboard tube with packing material in the end of the tube.  We have unwrapped and rerolled it twice now, putting it back in the tube easily each time.  Now we want to have it framed with foamboard behind it and without glass, to use pushpins to show our travels. Our only question at this point relates to the custom framing, and we will follow up here when we see how that works out.  The framer (at Hobby Lobby) thinks it should be dry-mounted, since there will not be glass to hold the map flat, and they don't have mats large enough for it, but they expressed concern about the success of dry-mounting it because of the lamination.  We are trying to get advice/feedback from different sources regarding the framing, but if we do not get that, we expect to proceed with trying the dry-mounting since the map is so inexpensive , especially compared to the cost of framing it, and we could buy a replacement if the heat of the dry-mount process ruins the laminated map.

I have read a ton of different books and articles and blogs posts about art journaling and different techniques and approaches. But \"Art Journal Freedom\" is really in a class all its own.\n\nInstead of telling you what you \"should\" and \"shouldn't\" do, or telling you there ARE no rules, Dina Wakley simply shares her own approaches to art journaling. Everything from materials to technique to approaches to composition and color is included in this book.

I plan ahead with the timing of extracurricular activities, making crock pot meals and prep ahead meals when we'll get home late.
