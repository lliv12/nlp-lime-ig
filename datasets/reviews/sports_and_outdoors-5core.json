The spooner's would go about 4 feet and then just stop and the kids said they tilted to the side and they couldn't stay on. As for using these during the summer if you've got a bike, basketball court, baseball field or a park field around you why waste any time tooling around on this thing? In the summer my son and daughter ride a ripstick waveboard and skateboards and these are infinitely more fun than this spooner piece of crap.

So basically, the product comes with an attachable door anchor which allows you to be able to do a variety of work outs such as pec flies or rotator cuff exercises.

I've recovered from surgery and I'm now catching up on recovering strength using this product.  I feel that the continual and steady resistance the bands provide through the entire exercise motion is more efficient in strengthening the targeted muscles than free weights. Steady resistance is much harder to maintain with free weights.  Even at light resistance, these bands provide that steady pressure that can be increased as the muscles strengthen, plus you can hold the pressure at any point during the motion simply by stopping for a count of 3 or 5, etc. This works great, for example, on bicep curls if you hold on the return motion when your elbows are at 90 degrees; makes you feel the burn! This system is allowing me to regain strength slowly, easily and steadily. The bands, the couplings, the handles, etc., are all well-designed and made of high quality materials.

Now I wanted to get some new ones to continue exercising mainly in the winter as I am very active the rest of the year. My trainer form blue cross showed me some models out there that were endorsed by Blue Cross. I noticed he used these from Black Mountain that were not on the list. He explained that he was on a budget and the latex tubes are all fairly equal. I did some research and they all last about a year if used every other day. I bought them and they are so much better than I was expecting.\n\nI do get a kick out of the reviews that say this $19.99 is not as nice as the $90 sets. Really? Oh well. They are very sturdy and work perfect for me. I vary my routine but keep the ones going for my shoulder. If you are like me and just need some extra exercise in the winter, I recommend this set.\n\nLike all makes of these check for wear or cracks before starting your routine.

They're great.  They're not perfect, but as far as other band products in this range go, these are probably as good as it gets.  The ability to stack the weight on these bands really makes these stand out from other bands out there.  Here is how I use these:\n\n==Cardio==\n\n-Resistance for doing punching movements, over the head movements, etc - greatly increases core, shoulder, & tricep/bicep activation(depending on how its held).  I recommend checking out Tapout XT & Tapout XT2 for many movements and how to do this.\n\n-Anchor the bands under your feet and hold the bands over your head while doing squats\n\n-Several other creative ways to incorporate bands to increase cardio & muscle activatio\n\n==Muscle Building & Hypertrophy==\n\nThat's right, you can really build muscle with these!  If you have no weights and want to work on building muscle, then these are a great replacement to start using.  Have weights and don't think you need these?  Think again.\n\n-You can use the bands themselves like you would for regular weights for most muscle building exercises.  The big difference is that resistance bands have a different strength curve than weights, so you work your muscles in different ways  (at the end of the rep, the resistance will be the greatest, whereas regular weights will either be constant or decrease)\n\n-You can combine weights and bands together in a single movement (holding the band & weight, or have the band anchored on the weight) to increase the resistance and difficulty of an exercise (ex. regular dumbell curls are hardest when your arm is at 90 degrees, band curls are hardest at the top of the curl, holding a dumbell and band together with the band anchored in front of you makes the whole thing hard from beginning to end).\n\n-With the door & pole anchors, you can use these bands like you would any cable machine at the gym.  I recommend buying 2 sets of bands, or getting a different option that includes 2 pole anchors and matching pairs of bands to get the most out of this option.\n\nI've used Athlean X/X2 for a lot of tricks on using bands in my weight lifting routine (check him out on youtube)\n\nThese bands are super quick to stack on, just clip the carabiner to the handle.  It takes seconds to add/remove bands.  To fine tune how much resistance you want, you can also step closer/farther away from the anchor point.\n\nThe included pole anchor works great and is very handy.  Having 2 of these (from the 2 orders of the product) makes for a good cable machine substitute since I will anchor these to the poles on my squat rack (I have the base of the squat rack weighed down by a couple of 70 lb dumbbells to make sure it doesn't move).\n\nThe handles work great.  They have hard plastic handles with soft foam on the outside to make them nice to grip.\n\nThe only downside to this package is the door anchor.  It doesn't seem to be very forgiving if there is a tiny gap in the door.  Other bands that I've used with a door anchor have a larger, harder foam piece about 1\" square so that if there is a gap in the door, it won't easily slid through.\n\nThe only thing I wish about these bands is that they would build in a fail safe.  I've seen other bands that have either a nylon sleeve on the outside (expensive bands), or some sort of rope on the inside so that if a band happens to break, it won't come snapping back at your face.\n\nPSA: always check your bands to see if there are any cuts/fraying.

The red band got so stretched out it can't be far behind.  I used those two bands for pretty much every workout, though.\n\nThe great part - I e-mailed BMP about the replacement band warranty, Rich responded in a day, and had my replacements in the mail immediately at no cost to me!  I just got them a couple days later.  Fantastic service, and a great product I'll continue to use for my home and travel workouts!\n\nOriginal Review:\nI'm a lifelong weightlifter and bought these to take on a several-month trip where I wouldn't have access to a gym.  They worked great once I got used to the difference of using resistance bands instead of regular weights.  I mostly used the red, black and blue together for heavier exercises like standing bicep curls (the bands passing under my feet to anchor them), took off the blue for tricep pulldowns and lat rows, used just the red for front and lateral delt raises, and so on.\n\nCoupled with other bodyweight-only exercises I got a full, toning workout while traveling.  I didn't build up muscle, but I stayed in good shape.  And if you roll the bands up carefully, the whole bag flattens down nicely to fit in the front outside pocket of a suitcase.\n\nThe anchor-strap was great with almost every doorway I used it on, too...there were a couple that were obviously too weak to support the kind of stress I was going to put on them.  And you have to place it so the strap won't slide towards you the first time you pull, or you might do very minor damage to the wood or paint.", "summary": "Great for travel!", "unixReviewTime": 1456012800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2016", "reviewerID": "A15NZD5WINDQZM", "asin": "7245456313", "reviewerName": "BONFOGLIO", "reviewText": "no more trainer  these r great and so convenient  i just wish they came with an extra set of hand grips", "summary": "no more trainer these r great and so convenient i just wish they came with ...", "unixReviewTime": 1455926400}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2016", "reviewerID": "A11LDMNQ9IPG7N", "asin": "7245456313", "reviewerName": "Phil C.", "reviewText": "Purchased these for my wife for Christmas, she really likes them.

The Black Mountain set is 1/3 the price of my BL set, but the hardware is not as robust.  In addition, these bands are rated a lot higher in resistance weight than the BL.  In the BL set, I used the 8 lb band for arm exercises.  With this set I use the 25-30 lb band.  Feels the same.  So if you really want a resistant band for some more strenuous exercise, these are probably not for you.  You can double up on bands if you like, but that's not the point.  The BL had two attachments which allowed you to secure the band to a closed door and pull against it.  Very good for traveling.  This one requires hardware that needs to be mounted if you are going to use them in such a fashion.  The 25-30 lb band I use provides for smooth, not jerky motion.  I like that.  This has a lifetime warranty.  We'll see.\nOverall: they work.  Good for light workout.\nOn Second Thought: I couldn't figure out why I had ordered a set of bands that required metal brackets for a door.  If you've ever used a set of metal brackets on a door, say to just hang clothes, you know that they: 1) scar the door; 2) usually prevent closing; 3) scar the door frame.  So I rechecked the product display on Amazon only to find out that the bands were supposed to come with a cloth door anchor.  Instead, they substituted the metal brackets.  I returned the whole set.

They are still new so I will have to wait to report on their durability and longevity, but they appear very sturdy.\nThe bands are \"weighted\" by color and the booklet has their listed weight estimates. The weight of the resistance can change dramatically depending on how far you stretch it. Example: overhead press puts much more \"weight\" into the band than say a curl might. This gives a similar effect to squatting with a chain. The intensity increases further into the movement.\nThe insertion point of the band into the nylon/hook area is very well manufactured. It has a knot, wrapped in a rubber sleeve, that has been inserted through an eyelet. The clips are strong carabiners and are not hooked to the bands in any way, they are hooked to the nylon.\nThe handles are foam, not rubber, grips, so I assume the normal wear and tear from a foam handle, but they are not, in any way, flimsy. The system works very simply to clip in and out for varying resistance. It's a quick and easy change when you move between exercises. When I had mine in the door frame, I kept all the bands hanging and only clipped the ones I needed. It worked great so my boyfriend and I could swap out between sets without any fuss.\nThe door anchor is decent; I have seen more secure versions but I still don't imagine this will be a problem. The anchor is smaller than what I'm used to seeing (I have always seen the \"tube\" style anchors, this one is a few small... things... inside the nylon) but it seems to work just fine. The anchor can go over the door, or on the hinge side of the door to adjust for height. Both these methods work great and are simple to set up.\nThe ankle strap is soft and comfortable with a sturdy D ring to clip to the bands.\nThe total system is small, lightweight, and incredibly versatile. Aside from being great just to have in your home or small apartment, they would be great for personal trainers who do in-home training, physical therapists, or the fitness minded person who likes/needs to travel; just throw it in your suitcase and go.\nI got a great workout from these bands and they offer resistance in a way that weights do not. Similar to working out with TRX... the moves may be the same, but the muscles it works may be different, or the same muscles may be worked in a different way. This is a great addition to any gym. I don't know what took me so long to get a set. I'm very happy with the system, the product, and the customer service (I called to talk with CS to ask them about a promotion they had noted in the paperwork. They were so nice.

A Biceps Curl is a perfect example.  When using a resistance band for a biceps curl at the top of the movement (meaning when your arm is up towards your shoulder) there is still resistance being placed on the muscle because of the elasticity of the band.  If you were doing the same biceps curl with a standard free weight barbell, at the top of the movement there is little to no resistance being placed on the muscle.  This is the beauty of Dynamic Resistance Training. The muscle is being placed under constant tension.\n\nAt some point you may find that there is not enough resistance when using any one individual band, but no worries!  Just combine a couple of bands to increase the resistance!\n\nAs a Customer:\nI like having a set of bands around for when I can't get to the gym or I am traveling.  Everything easily fits in the bag that is included and they are compact.  It's very easy to switch positioning or add bands thanks to the quick release clips. I enjoy using bands with handles versus the therapy bands that are used by Physical Therapists or Yoga instructors.

This sets also contains more bands than less expensive sets, including a black band for maximum resistance.\n\nThe only thing that could be improved would be the addition of one of those foam donuts on a strap that lets you fix the straps to a doorframe by wedging it between the door and the doorjamb.  Fortunately we had one of these from a previous pack of bands so it wasn't a problem, but if we hadn't had that we would have been out of luck for this type of exercise.", "summary": "Solid product", "unixReviewTime": 1420761600}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2015", "reviewerID": "A2NCKBQIRGL8MK", "asin": "7245456313", "reviewerName": "Brian K.

So far, so good.  I haven't had any quality control problems: no ripping or tearing.  The bands are crisp, and handles are well made and comfortable.\n\nThis is my first time using bands.  I have a few hundred dollars worth of free weights sitting in my basement collecting dust because--even though I prefer free weights--it is difficult for me to juggle my family commitments if I'm sitting in my basement.  I also don't want to bring my free weights upstairs because have a feeling my kids would go to town with them, and I'd end up with a lot of broken stuff (including toes).\n\nWith this set, I can use the door kit and get in a decent work out while keeping an eye on my kids and even talking to them.  If something happens and I need to intervene, I can literally just let go of the handles and run to wherever I need to be to fulfill my parental duties.  If that means taking one of the kids to the potty, I don't have to worry about the other throwing a dumbell at one of the dogs while I'm in the bathroom.  These bands will just hang out for me.\n\nThe only really risky thing I've noticed is that one time my daughter started to open the closet door when I was facing away and doing \"benchpresses.\"  I'm guessing that might have ended with the bands slingshotting into my back, but luckily I noticed her before I had to find out the hard what happens when the bands fly free.\n\nThe kids have tried to play with them, but mostly just jokingly mimicking me.  They aren't strong enough to pull the bands to any degree that would really risk physical harm, and they quickly give up once my workout is over.  After they're done with their \"workouts,\" I just open the door and put these in the closet.\n\nOverall, I think these are a great value.  The package is complete and reasonably priced.  The quality (for me) has been great.  If there is a downside, it's the obvious weight limitation.  You're not going to be entering any Mr. Universe contests using these.  If you want to get *big* you're going to need a *lot* of bands (and you might end up destroying all your doors).  Personally, I'm not looking to get Lifter Huge, I just want to keep my upper body working.\n\nI would consider these good for physical therapy (lots of full range of motion exercises you can do at lower weights), early stage muscle growth, or larger mass maintenance.

I've currently own a Marcy weight cage that has a dual pulley  system in the rear with attachments centered high and low.  My weight bench is a standard Marcy bench that does not allow for the attachment of a leg developer.  Prior to purchasing this set, I could do single arm flyes from the high position in various formats.  This is an acceptable way to accomplish this exercise if and only if you maintain even counts, form, and weight to avoid lop sided development.  This is a lot harder than it sounds.\n\nWith two of these resistance band sets, I am now able to attach bands to my upper right and left supports for true fly type exercises.  Because I purchased 2 sets, I now have 4 handles.  This turned out to be a blessing as it allowed me to loop one set of handles around the upper supports to keep the rubber from the bands from rubbing against any bolt ends or sharper metal edges, while still leaving two handles to perform the exercises.  Additionally, because I ordered two sets, I now have two ankle straps.  This allows me to attach the bands low under my weight bench, looped over the leg restraint foam rollers, and perform normal resistance leg development without the need to purchase a whole new bench.\n\nI've added several new exercises to my routine as a result of this purchase.  The reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5:\nI have a concern about potential wear on these bands.  I received them in what I would consider to be nearly pristine condition, but running my hands along the bands, I can feel slight nicks in the rubber.  This could be normal, but given how rubber bands work, this could be a future concern.  For now though, it is merely a thought that I check after each usage.  Another concern here is in their usage and not so much a testament to the product.  It must be understood that because these are essentially giant rubber bands, they attempt to snap back to original form.  Make sure to take proper, sturdy, stances when using these.\n\nAfter much more time with them, I may upgrade them to a 5 star product.  That depends wholly on how they \"wear\" with daily usage.

This review has been updated after over a year of regular use of the set 3 times a week. Please, read at least the first paragraph if you plan to use the DOOR ANCHOR included in the set.\n\nThis is important usability info. The door anchor included in the set can ruin the bands after a very few uses due to friction of the vulnerable rubber tubes against the rough material of the anchor. This peace clearly requires some technological improvement. I suspected this outcome immediately when inspected the set right after arrival, but, because of the lack of any experience with this kind of equipment, it was assumed that the bands were designed and manufactured to withstand this friction, especially because the enclosed brochure showed some exercises with a band passed through the anchor and handles attached to both ends. After 10-15 rehab sessions both bands showed clear signs of wear and tear in the places of contact with the anchor and a few cracks were found. At that point, after some experimentation, one solution was found, which helped to prolong the lifetime of already damaged bands for over a year,  the anchor was combined with the ankle strap and the bands were passed through the metal ring, which can accommodate up to three bands. The main disadvantage of this solution is that the ring is not large enough to routinely replace the bands, but it was sufficient in my case. A much better solution is to buy an anchor with a protective sleeve or another device that protects the rubber tubes. There are a few different options available on Amazon.com, which will be reviewed below.\n\nBesides the obvious drawback described in the first paragraph the set is quite decent and durable. One practical limitation is that bands included in the set provide only very moderate resistance for major muscle groups even if the strongest three tubes are combined. So, for a reasonably fit man, this set is suitable for rehab rather than strength and muscle building. A premium orange band is available that can help to overcome this limitation, but even this will not be sufficient for a strong man. As was mentioned in the original review below, these bands are not suitable for serious strength building/maintenance.\n\nActually, it makes sense to limit the resistance of these bands because of technological limitations of the elastic material or tube construction, which, apparently, don't allow regular and prolonged tension beyond the limits of the recommended use of bands included in the set. In my personal example, and I am very far from a body builder, after about 10 months of regular appropriate use following recommendations outlined below in the original review, deep holes developed in two of most frequently used bands. They were monitored, and the bands were still used as before. These holes are not related to the damage described in the first paragraph since they are located quite far from the place of contact with the anchor. So, they are obviously due to some technological fault of the tube construction. By now, one band has had to be decommissioned because the hole started to grow with each use and the band could break any time. According to these observations, the bands are nevertheless quite resilient and don't break suddenly even in the presence of a rather serious damage as in two cases described above.\n\nRecommendations: 1. Consider buying a separate door anchor that prevents the tubes from rubbing against the nylon webbing. I've purchased three different anchors -- SKLZ Pro Door Anchor, Heavy Duty Door Anchor by Albingo, and Lifeline Heavy Duty Door Anchor. Also, I got one with the Bodylastics set mentioned below. All of them have different sizes and constructions and maybe more or less useful in particular situations. Nevertheless, all of them have a common distinctive feature  cable protection from friction.\n2. Depending on anticipated strain and load consider buying a more appropriate set of bands/cables. I've purchased Bodylastics Max XT Warrior Edition System, which provides for much greater loads. Also, it's more convenient to use, it looks much more advanced both technologically and aesthetically, and it includes several additional useful items.\n\nOriginal Review\n\nThese bands are as good as most similar products, and they should last for long time with moderate reasonable use. What is different about this set is a shocking number of reports about torn and broken bands that often caused serious injuries and even a few cases of disability. Also, it's quite unusual to read these reports in some 4- and 5-star reviews.\n\nUsually, I don't pay much attention to 1- and 2-star reviews because it's very common for people to have various reasons for dissatisfaction, which have little to do with the quality and usability of the product itself. Actually, since I was going to use the bands for rehabilitation and the number of positive reviews was overwhelming, I decided that this product should serve its purpose for me and bought it in September 2013. This conclusion appeared to be accurate, and, before writing a regular review, I decided to read again what other people were saying. And this time many reviews sounded very alarming, often, apparently, without the author's intention. What could one think reading a 5-star review that asserts that if the exercise equipment breaks, it is beneficial for the user because this indicates increased power of the user, and the sooner it happens the better? And this opinion was not an exception. Somehow, I didn't feel comfortable using this product and conducted in-depth Internet research on similar products including Amazon reviews. The results are as follows:\n\n1. As some reviewers suggested, this product had improved over time, and many reported incidents might not be relevant for new purchases, so it might be prudent to disregard old reviews. Unfortunately, many new positive reviews from 2013 mentioned various quality related issues. This could be due to incorrect use of the bands.\n2. Similar products sold on Amazon have much better feedback, and complains are about incomplete sets, delivery issues, wrong band size, etc., but not about damaged bands and injuries. And a few products, such as Bodylastics and JS Fitness sets have almost no negative reviews. I have no intention to advertise anything, but one should not look any farther than Amazon to find some alternatives to compare and make a choice.\n3. The bands certainly should not break in a few months and even years unless they are defective or damaged by inappropriate use. Of course, some drivers can wreck a perfectly good car in a few months, but it doesn't indicate they've become superior drivers. If the active or working length of a band is not stretched more than 4 times, the band should serve for many months of daily use.\n4. There are bands with built-in protective devices, such as inclosing sleeves and enclosed cords, which should prevent possible injuries and traumas in case of band failure.\n5. The flat bands might be a better alternative since their length and, therefore, resistance can be adjusted much easier. They can be folded multiple times if needed, which increases both resistance and reliability. There are extremely heavy duty flat or loop bands suitable for heavy lifting and body building.\n\nPractical recommendations:\n1. Inspect every band thoroughly on arrival for any possible defects.\n2. Test every band carefully with gradually increased load and inspect thereafter.\n3. Contact the manufacturer in case of any issue and/or question. They have excellent customer service, which I had a chance to verify personally on a few occasions.\n4. This set should be perfectly fine for light to moderate loads and/or infrequent use.\n5. Read the enclosed instructions before using the bands. The most important safety instructions are periodic inspections and overstretch prevention.\n6. If no defects are found after a few uses, the bands are likely to be in a good condition and unlikely to break without any indication of wear and tear, which can be revealed by periodic inspections.\n7. Avoid stretching the bands more than 4 times their active or working length. Rolling a band around the hand or reducing its length in any other way will reduce its working length. This should not be used to increase resistance (overstretch), but only if there is insufficient room for exercises. Using entire band should always be preferred.\n8. Using bands attached to a door, wall, post, etc. effectively doubles the resistance, saves room, and allows for greater control and variety of exercises.\n9. Avoid incidental cuts, pinches, scratches, etc., which can damage the band. Always inspect bands after using them in some unusual way and/or by another person.\n10. If the items above sound like too much hassle, consider buying more reliable and, possibly, more expensive bands with protective sleeves or cords, which will give you peace of mind and can actually be more economic.\n11. Read customer reviews on Amazon very carefully before buying any product if you plan to use it for vigorous and tough exercises.\n\nP.S. A huge number of trivial positive reviews might be caused by the \"free orange band reward\" promised by the manufacturer for a fair review, which can encourage many people to write a few words instead of agreeing with already existing reviews, which would have been much more convenient for new customers.", "summary": "Band Reliability Review", "unixReviewTime": 1396051200}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2014", "reviewerID": "ANSNTK7SHA3CK", "asin": "7245456313", "reviewerName": "Jenny", "reviewText": "I'm mostly using the black and red bands.

I called and spoke to the owner (two brothers own and run this company, no pesky automated phone line or overseas language barriers to deal with when I called!). These are indeed assembled by hand by the owners in the US but because the rubber comes from Malaysia, they can't call it \"Made in USA\". Grin, but I can.

This type of product is certainly convenient to use and offers a fair amount of resistance for my purposes. However, for those intent on building gobs of muscle, weights are of course ideal. I found that I needed some time to adjust to the feel of these bands. While the manual indicates some type of pound rating it doesn't feel accurate. The nominal rating of weak to strong is a better way to judge the resistance of each band. I chose a familiar exercise that would allow me to work through a range of bands. I knew what I  could lift with weights and compared that sensation to the band with a similar resistance. From there I could start to estimate which bands i might start with  for other exercises. The kit is nicely put together with a wide range of bands and extra straps for doors and ankles. The carrying bag holds everything without being cramped and is well suited for travelling. As another reviewer noted, the bands are rubber and are subject to wear. It behooves the user to inspect them regularly before use.\n\nUpdate: I have used this kit several times now and wanted to add a finding. I found the exercises more satisfying when contracting and holding the muscles being worked on at the end of the positive movement. This gives extra focus to the area at hand and makes the most out of the resistance that the bands offer.

We have completed one full cycle of P90X and part of a second cycle, although we eventually switched to weights for most of the program.  We continued to use these bands for pull-ups\n\nThe Good:\nThese bands are easy to use, and being able to clip multiple bands onto the handles is helpful.  Some people may need more weight than this set can provide.  Since my wife did not use the \"heaviest\" red band very often, I borrowed hers to make my simulate pull-ups more challenging.\n\nThe door strap works well near a hinge, and these bands also worked well over a pull up bar.  Overall they have held up fairly well.\n\nThe Bad:\nOut of our two sets, one strap broke at the metal clasp.  I expected one of the rubber tubes to give out, but instead the metal snapped where the clip swivels around on the post that attaches to the band.  Fortunately no one was hurt when it went, but it left a mark on the top of the door frame when it went during a pull-up.\n\nSome of the bands show a lot of wear from friction when standing on the band to shorten it or to increase tension, as the P90X videos demonstrate.  Again, none of them have snapped, but we stopped using one of the black bands just in case.\n\nOverall:\n\nI liked the bands to get started on P90X, but ultimately decided they weren't giving me the workout I wanted.  As soon as I switched to some \"dial weights\" I felt I was getting a better workout.  The weight ratings on these bands did not match up with using actual weights at all.  In theory, if I was lifting 20 lbs according to the band tension rating, I needed to back down to 10-15 pounds on the free weights.\n\nStill, we were not disappointed in our purchase of these bands.

I saw limited use and limited results for them.  No way they could be used for any serious purpose,  I thought.  Limited to light resistance, hi-rep functional strengthening and conditioning within the confines of a physical therapist's office - boy, was I wrong!\n\nI lift 5 days a week, and love to incorporate cable machines for full range of motion resistance.  Only problem is (was) that I don't have access to a cable machine at home or on the road and getting to the gym at 0530hrs was an exercise in self-discipline.  I looked at several other band sets from many other manufacturers before selecting Black Mountain.  At this price and with a 90-day return policy and lifetime warranty, if I didn't like them I could return them or let the wife and kids use them.  Throw in \"Made in the USA\" and I figured they were worth an audition.\n\nWell, color me impressed!  I can easily replicate all of the exercises I used to perform on cables and more.  Rows, lat pulldowns, crossover chest pulls, hammer curls, concentration curls, tricep extensions and pulldowns - these have even replaced freeweights for lunges, good-mornings, and calf raises!  Even with no freeweights, you can still get a full-body workout with these bands, and add-ons are available to up the resistance.  Believe me, the pump you feel after a workout with these is every bit as good as you'll feel leaving a gym.\n\nI like the stackability of these over the individual bands with handles - you can mix and match throughout your sets to increase resistance between sets.  With the handles, door anchor, and ankle strap, there really isn't anything you can't do on the go out of the small carrying bag.\n\nThe quality is great - at first I was a little hesitant to put too much weight on the thick nylon anchor, but now I am more concerned about the door frame I put it in!  The foam handles are comfortably sized, and you can even slide them in the loops to replicate pronated and supinated hand positions for various exercises.\n\nNow these can't be this good without a few minor limitations.  You do need to be creative with positioning the bands or your body to perform some exercises - you'll find them too long for some, too short for others.  I'm 6'3\" and my wife is 5'7\" - we both have to make some accommodations, but there is nothing we just cannot do.  Also, the addition or option of a bar would be awesome - hint, hint BMP!\n\nAll in all, great product - we get great strength training workouts in minimal space.

This might replace my free weights and I won't be ordering a total gym(I had been looking at getting one when I come back from vacation) for a while thanks to this package.\n\nPros:\n- lots of options- 5 bands, 2 handles, 1 wrapstrap, and one door attachment. It also come with some helpful instructions(some exercise ideas in it) and what looks like a great warranty. I won't be using the heavier bands for a while but my boyfriend likes them. Use it on the floor, standing, or with the door.\n- quick and easy- You can use one band or multiples, it is quick to change bands and workouts, and you don't have to detach the bands to put them through the door strap.\n- comfy- The handles are padded and rotate so they don't tweak your hands, the rubber doesn't catch any little body hairs, and the velcro wrapstrap is nicely padded. It is a little stiff, but it should relax with use.\n- door attachment- Mentioned above, but my favorite attachment. A lot of overhead tricep moves hurt my elbow but with the door I can pull down instead and it feels good and strong. I have other straps and resistance bands but these are way nicer. I use the door thing most in the 2 times I've used the kit, and I can't rave enough about it. Use it for inner or outer thighs while standing, to help with situps or add resistance to them, use it to work on pushups while standing, or rowing moves. Its great. You can change the workout just by turning around.\n- travels well- The bag it come with is nice and small, everything fits in it, will fit in a suitcase easily, and I can see using in a hotel room no trouble.\n- great price\n\nCons:\nNone so far!\n\nEDIT:\nSome reviews say the bands are too long or short for certain moves. If they are too short don't double it, instead of stepping on middle and raising both ends, step on one end and raise the other end. If they are too long, like for certain leg moves, then double it. The door strap makes length a non-issue for me, I just move closer or further from the door. For leg stuff without the door, I put the wrapstrap on one ankle, connect both ends to the metal loop and put the middle around the other ankle for side steps.\n\nEdit: one of the rotating metal pieces on one of my bands popped off.

These exercises require you to stand on the middle of the band and push all the way up until your arms are fully extended.  For these exercises, the bands are too short for me and I worry how long they'll last if I keep stretching them that far.  I'm 6'0\" tall, so someone shorter might not have any problem.  If you're 6' or taller, I would find something longer because these will disappoint.  The B-Line bands used by Tony Horton for P90x and his other videos appear to be roughly twice as long as these.\n\nThese are good quality bands though.  The grommets are strong and the clips are metal and thus, less prone to breaking.  The door attachment and ankle accessory work fine.  The \"instruction manual\" is a little sparse and simplistic but you can't expect too much there.  Suspiciously, I noticed that none of the exercises show the bands being lifted any higher than shoulder length.\n\nEDIT: I increased my review to a 4 star after using the bands a while longer and speaking to their customer service.  I also got a free orange band for my call.  According to customer service the bands can actually stretch safely up to 5 times their original size  (their max stretch is about 40 ft. although this makes them unusable).  After 3 weeks of overhead use they still show no signs of wear or tear.\n\nEDIT: Still on the fence about these.  After 6 weeks of use I had to get the red band replaced after seeing several tears appear.  Now I'm seeing tears in the black band and one tear in the new red band already.

Whatever you do, make sure you get a number of bands (just like this set!)\n\nWhen I started P90X I used just one braided Reebok resistance band, because I didn't think I'd need multiple different resistance strengths. I was wrong. Certain exercises were too light, no matter how big I made the loop, and certain exercises too heavy, even with no loop. The problem, especially with making a really big loop, is that you overstretch the band and before you know it, it tears. Mine tore within 2 months.\n\nThe BMP set, however, is great. I use all five bands, from the lightest one (yellow) for straight arm shoulder flies to a combination of the heaviest ones (red and black) for bicep curls. Speaking of which, this is a really clever system that allows you to use multiple bands in one exercise, so you can create your own weight. Really smart. The door hook anchor is also cleverly made, with no metal parts, so if for some reason your door isn't strong enough, at least no metal will be flying in the direction of your face.\n\nThe only thing I would do is call BMP before they ship your stuff, and ask them if you could order an extra set of handles to be shipped along with your order. It makes switching between bands (and therefore between exercises) so much easier!

As a free weight lifter myself 5 days a week I needed something to take with me traveling.\n\nPros:\n1. bands are very durable\n2. hooks on bands are great.\n3. enough weight for the average to slightly above average lifter for 10-12 reps\n4. Great for the money and beginner (even with a new door anchor)\n5. Compact bag is great that holds everything.  Easily fits in even the most packed suitcase.  No excuse for not working out while traveling anymore.\n\nCons:\n1. The material they use for the handles are very rough (not the part you hold onto but that holds the handles and hooks). For intense lifting scraped knuckle raw.  With gloves you will be more then good.\n2. The door anchor is a joke! Number 1 complaint by far. Highly recommend you purchase an additional one for 10-12 dollars more with a big base. Trust me if the door is even slightly looser it will snapped back and it hurts! This was a hotel solid door that it snapped back so not even a hollow inside home door. And yes I double and triple checked that it was solid behind the door but when you are doing multiple reps and pulling at full resistance the door anchor can move to the wrong position.\n3. They use a half moon ring for the handles for the bands to snap onto. A little annoying cause it will not stay in place. A round ring would work better.\n\nUltimately this is a great set, minus the door anchor, for the money. I would highly recommend them for anybody looking for a portable gym. With my travels, hotels only provide treadmills typically but the lifter is left out.  Great way to keep up with your workout or mix it up.  It can be a fun way to workout also if free weights are unavailable or you do not have a spotter.  Again BEWARE of the door anchor!  With exception of the door anchor the other cons are not that big of a deal.

What pushed me to the Chicago Pneumatic sets was the fact that they have every socket with no sizes missing (12 mm seemed to be commonly left out and was a thorn in several reviews).  When the sockets arrived, my first thought was of the sturdy plastic box - both that it is far stronger than most shipping boxes and also that it could be much smaller.  Opening the nice latch on each of the boxes revealed a specific spot for each of the sockets.  I would imagine that someone could cut the lid off the box and use it as an organizer for the sockets in a tool cart.  The sockets themselves are well made - perfect machining on the outside with some minor burrs and slightly off-center through holes (1/2 point off the score).  Instead of a smooth interior to the square drive area, or machined in divots, each socket has a hole drilled through so it will work with pin retention, the little ball or a hog ring.  The remaining 1/2 point deduction comes from the size marking on the sockets.  Each socket is both laser marked and stamped - which seems perfect.  Except that the stamped mark is rather small for my eyes and the laser engraving which has the potential to be excellent is mostly used with a big CP and a little size marking.\n\nIn the end, I will live with the (could be better) size markings, be happy that all the size increments are included and look forward to picking up the Chicago Pneumatic 3/8 drive size version of these sets.", "summary": "Has all the sizes", "unixReviewTime": 1349222400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2012", "reviewerID": "ASSY47C6YEJ9C", "asin": "B00000IT1G", "style": {"Color:": " Blue.

I upgraded the electronics to use a 7-cell pack, which unfortunately requires replacing the ESC, receiver and steering servo, as they're all combined into a horrendous plastic maelstrom.  The speed picked up noticeably.\n\nIt doesn't hold up so well at the track.  Without properly damped shocks (\"friction damped\" by default), the car bounces around all over the place and frequently loses control.  It has a high center of gravity compared to its big brother, so it flips over all the time, and even with the 7-cell pack, doesn't have the speed to clear any real jumps.  Also, the turnbuckles are small aluminum threaded rods, and bend very easily.  There are a few companies that offer replacement shocks and turnbuckles, but that's up to you to decide if it's worth it.\n\nIt's still a fun little car to play with.  With a few upgrades to the suspension and motor, it will hold up much better on a track.  It turns well and is very nimble.

The leather sheath has an internal plastic scabbard and it is sometimes difficult to re sheath the knife.  Even after repeated practice, the blade sometimes get hung up. If you remove the plastic scabbard, the blade will bounce around too much and the knife can more easily fall out of the sheath. This really isn't a big deal but if you're buying the knife, you should know about it before hand.\n\nThe gimping on the top of the blade is very deep and is rougher than I'm used to. On the bright side, it will even work when you're wearing gloves.\n\nOtherwise, the knife is what you expect from Case. It is well made, with an excellent finish.  The full tang blade is nicely polished and razor sharp. It made with Case's Tru-Sharp Surgical steel which is about the same as Buck's 420HC steel. I'd love to see the knife made with CV (maybe a future Case Release).  The handle is well pinned with brass rivets and smoothly polished. The tang, handle and rivets are all smooth and the fit is near perfect.\n\nThe leather sheath, is well stitched top quality cow grain leather. The Case logo is deeply embossed and a nice touch. It is leaps and bounds ahead of any so-called top-grain leather sheath I've seen that were \"globally imported. The photos do not really do justice the dying and polishing of the sheath. It was built to last and will hold up well in the field or on the trail.\n\nDespite two very minor flaws I'm still feel this a \"5 Stars\" knife.  I mentioned the flaws so you can make up your on mind. In my view, the knife is definite keeper and will please both the collector as well as the outdoors-man/hunter.

The design is sort of a compromise. Because it is positioned low on the unit, you do have to place the cooler on the edge of a table or other elevated surface so you can get a cup under it.

The handles make it easy for two people to carry it when it is filled and heavy, or one strong person to lift and move. The cooler is double-walled for insulation, and the inside is easy to sponge out when the festivities are over.\n\nMy only complaint is the lid screw design.

I bought it in 2004, and it has held up really well for the past 9 years. Amazon was out of stock for a couple of years, so I'm super glad that it's back in stock, so I can recommend it to my friends.\n\nThis board is different than other balance boards that I've used, and I really liked that. Even if you have another balance board, I'd recommend this one, too. It's probably most similar to skateboarding or snowboarding, but it will help your balance in any sport. It took me about three weeks to get to the point that I am today, but I started out super uncoordinated. You'll probably pick it up much faster. I thought it was a great balance board to learn on, too. I definitely felt a sense of accomplishment after I got my balance enough to stay up on it for a minute or two.\n\nIt says the weight limit is 300 lbs, but this is super sturdy. I think it would actually work anywhere up to a 400 pound person.\n\nIt's pretty simple. You just roll back and forth and balance on top of it. If you got really good at it, you could do tricks and turns, but I'm not good enough to do much more than roll back and forth. I feel like it's really good exercise, too, and you could use weights on it, too, if you got to be really good at it.\n\nPros:\n+Works on any surface. I've used it mostly on carpet.\n+Extremely sturdy. It would be very hard to break this.\n+Helps you prepare your balance for any sport or activity\n+Low impact, so you can use this even if you have sore joints\n+After you get used to it, you could watch TV, play video games, or read a book while you're balancing\n\nCons:\n-Very simple.

I've coached 13 seasons of youth rec soccer between my children, indoor and outdoor, and have seen the full spectrum of skills and abilities on our teams.  I've recommended this training device to several kids on my teams who need extra  touches to improve their passing/trapping/shooting, and general foot coordination, I think they stand to benefit the most, but advanced players can benefit as well.\n\nSo far, we've only used this a handful of times, and it's difficult for my youngest daughter to get the ball up in the air, so the ball plunks off the base crossbar bar and doesn't really rebound back.  This rebounder will encourage her to kick with better form.\n\nThis will help my 9yr/old son improve his shooting and passing as well, but he has already begun using it to practice goalkeeping.  He kicks hard from about 20 feet out at slight angles, and then has to move quickly to cover the rebound.  The ball comes off of the rebounder at surprisingly strong and fast pace.\n\nThe rebounder does tend to tip over for harder shots, and shots that hit the frame, especially when the rebounder is in a more reclined position.  I see the need for using the included stakes, but I haven't tried them yet.\n\nAnother reviewer felt that this rebounder isn't durable enough for serious soccer, and they may be right; I don't plan to take this out to team practices, but you can tear up just about any equipment if not treated properly.  It handles hard shots from me just fine, even the ones that plunk off the bars.  I just don't see this being an issue unless you're shooting from close distance with maximum velocity.  That's not what this device is intended for.  Use a real goal for that type of shooting.  At this pricepoint, I only expect this rebounder to last a couple years max, any more is gravy.\n\nAssembly took longer than I expected, and the instructions were somewhat difficult to read, especially when connecting the top frame to the base, but it's manageable.\n\nI'll probably try this out in the driveway for practicing basketball as well.\n\nIf you have questions, post a comment, I usually respond within a day.", "summary": "Great training device", "unixReviewTime": 1332115200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2011", "reviewerID": "A2E74YKJXGZCJB", "asin": "B00004NKIQ", "style": {"Style Name:": " 6' x 4' White"}, "reviewerName": "Frank Perkins", "reviewText": "I wish I would have known about this product a few years ago when the kids first started soccer.

You can turn it around and use it like a regular goal, too!  It's very sturdy with 1.5\" steel tubes, however, one of the spring-loaded pins broke off with a sharp point showing (not a problem as I haven't taken the goal apart).\n\nAfter 1 year there is hardly any rust (it's been a rainy year here in southern CA with 30 days of rain).  It just BARELY fits into my SUV if I collapse the back (i.e. so the rebound almost faces up) so it's almost flat (no space for rear passengers).  That makes it pretty easy to transport 4 blocks to the park, and saves me time.  The only way to improve it would be to make it foldable.

This griddle cooks pancakes, french toast, cheese sandwiches and eggs on the smooth side wonderfully. Just kick the burners on high, let it warm up, knock them back to medium until its hot evenly and throw the food on. Don't worry about heating an empty pan, Cast iron can take it. When a water droplet bounces and its not smoking its ready. (Smoking is too hot, duh!)\n The other great use is to put it in the oven, turn the broiler/oven on and let it heat up. Then toss on the steaks, ribs, or fish! Yum!\nThe Lodge seasoning is ok for that first time cooking. You do need to wash off the manufacturing dirt, and a good coat of oil is a good way to start that carbon buildup.\nOn the down side, the burner grates on my stove instersect with the indented handle slots. There is a slight lip on the pan so that it rests directly on the grate. If you slide the pan down just slightly and to the center of the stove, it sets in just right. But I could see that on not all stoves it would fit as well. The alternative would be to get two of the open cast iron rings that fit on the stove grates and put the griddle on top of them. (These rings are normally designed to aid in holding a small pot over a larger more open gas stove grate) (I got two cast iron grates from the hardware store. I think they were \"storm\" grates. In an outside fire I burnt the paint off them and now they work fine holding the griddle up off the stove. Also Lodge has a 8\" castiron trivet which looks like it should work as well.)\nIt is heavy, yup. It doesn't fit in my sink very well, but then if you've ever watched the guy at the bar & grill clean his grill, he does it right on the stove. So while the giddle is hot, give it a good scrape with the spatula, and wipe it with a paper towel. You'll get 90% of the food/grease off the pan. Then a quick rinse when it cools down gets the rest. (In the sink put a large sponge under the edge and one behind it to avoid scratching things.)\nAlso if you cook bacon, or other high fat food, it splatters. Since the lip is low, it doesn't catch the grease spatters the way a good fry pan does. More stove cleanup...While it grills ok on the stove top, It's not a replacement for the charcoal cooker. You will need a good vent hood to catch the smoke. (Well yeah)\nAlso if you plan on using it inside your oven, measure first! Not all ovens are 20\" wide inside.\n(I have much older cast iron fry pans and everything that's been said about them becoming smooth and non stick is true.

The coils on the stove did not lift the grill up high enough and heat was trapped underneath which damaged the finish.  I finally retired it to the top of the stove to await the longed for day of owning a gas range.\n\nThat day finally arrived two years later after moving to a new home!  This grill was meant for the open flame of a gas range.  Keeping in mind the mess/damage created when cooking with the grill or oversize pots on the electric stove, I purchased a Kenmore Elite Duel Fuel range that has a really nice recessed range top that helps keep your hot cookware away from the finish.\n\nI used the grill for the first time on the new stove to make the Chicken Paillards from Stephen Raichlen's Indoor! Grilling cookbook.  The grill heated quickly, and the heat was evenly distributed so I wasn't limited to just cooking in one area like before because the smaller element on the electric stove didn't get the grill hot enough.\n\nEven though I wasn't using it that often on the other stove, I kept it seasoned so I didn't have any problems with sticking.  So far in addition to the chicken, I have cooked scrambled eggs, hash browns, and French toast without anything sticking.\n\nI still keep the grill on top of the stove, and I use it daily to toast bagels lightly spritzed with olive oil.  Both sides of the grill are seasoned and neither seem to be affected by direct exposure to the flames.\n\nAs with any cast iron cookware, clean up is a breeze if the cookware is seasoned properly.\n\n8/12/06\nI have since started using this on top of the grill grate of my Weber Kettle for grilling fish.  Since nothing else seemed to prevent fish from sticking, no matter how clean, hot, or how well oiled the grate.  I decided to try this on the grill since fish doesn't stick to it when I cook with it on top of the stove.  I grilled a whole salmon fillet(with skin) on it and scooped the whole thing off with my fish spatula with no sticking!

The only weakness is the set of velcro straps that secure the very good net to the frame.  These will fail over time, and I suggest buying some zip ties for a lasting means to connect the net to the frame.  It comes with six steel u-shaped stakes that hold the goal structure firmly in place.  These are needed with kids 10+ years old.  I think this is an excellent backyard or schoolyard goal and can be used with small sided games for youths.\n\nFor the 6 x 4 goal...This goal can work as a competition goal for kids about 8 and under who play small sided games. For kids that age and younger, this frame can take their best shots. Probably when kids get to about 9+ years old, they will start knocking it around even with the stakes. For all ages, this is a suitable goal for small goal games on a soccer field or in the backyard. The goal is pretty solid and sturdy. The stakes are helpful and the netting is good. If you are looking for a goal to put in the backyard or use for youth games that does not need to fold up, this is a good option.

It would have been nice to have a Pitchers rubber too, but it isn't like you can push off any non stationary base anyway.

Each base probably weighs a couple of pounds and seem very durable.....much better than the real thin, lightweight, flimsy base set.  On a flat gym floor, these will stay in place a lot better because of their weight.  They do a good job on the grass and are wonderful to throw in the trunk for possible pickup games with the kids (or their friends) or at a family picnic.  I guess if you really needed these bases to stick in the grass, I would recommend purchasing some 3/4\" or 1\" wide white webbing that's about 17\" long.  Use the poly/nylon webbing and some spikes to hold the webbing down over the bases.  You don't want to puncture the rubber bases because that puncture is just going to rip bigger and bigger.  My boys are only 5 and 7 yrs old so these are just fine.  If playing in the grass alot, I may have like to see Franklin make this same set in a neon/construction color orange.  The orange color would help make the bases pop a little more in the grass, and probably make them a little easier to see.  If the boys continue show interest in baseball and get older, I will make the investment for a more durable home plate with the 3-5 spikes in them so the home plate is thicker/heavier and stays in place during batting practice.  One improvement that I would like to see Franklin make on these rubber plates is to manufacture some heavy-duty \"tabs\" on the outside of the bases.  The tabs would have small holes in them so that you can use small ground spikes to anchor the bases down in the grass.  For home plate - use three tabs, you could have tabs on the front corners and at the back tip.  For the other bases, you could use four, but at minimum, have two tabs on opposite corners.", "summary": "Awesome temporary base set for kids and pickup games", "unixReviewTime": 1367193600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "5", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2013", "reviewerID": "A2BZVE4BIWPFK6", "asin": "B00004T1JW", "reviewerName": "Diver Dave", "reviewText": "Nice heavy duty base set.

Also, the \"tread\" on the bottom helps keep the bases in place. Obviously, if the grass is wet or the dirt is dry, they're going to slip...these aren't designed to compare to a secured base. Don't have unrealistic expectations. Still, I'm loving our set & think it should make it through the season. They fit in one of my baseball gear bags, but then it becomes too heavy & no room for helmets or catcher's gear. Got a collapsable wagon for the bases, tee, net, & gear bag.  Some have complained about not having a pitchers mound.  It'd be a nice inclusion, but for tee ball, we don't need it.

Extremely simple toggle system let me get right on the best focus.  Just press down with either left or right fingers.  I found it much easier than the ring type focus mechanism.  They are quite light as well compared with some more professional/pricey binoculars I have tried.  It seems they were about a pound with case and lens covers.\n\nThe case is a soft material and I would be careful packing them with anything that might damage the binoculars.  The case gives some protection from damage and has straps, so I carried them in the case at times around neck.  There are also straps for the binoculars.  I would not carry them for long around neck as I'd worry about damage.  The case closes with a single velcro fastener and anything small could easily fall out and get lost.  This is probably the only downside on this buy.  I am looking for some additional velcro I can attach to the case.\n\nThere are four lens covers and they do the job, but would fall off easy were you carrying the binoculars around neck or otherwise not attending close.  I only use the covers when the glasses are inside case.  I suspect these covers will get lost easy, especially as the soft sided case does not zip.\n\nI don't know the material used for these glasses and was shocked at the price for the quality.

He's about 40 inches tall and 32 pounds.  The seat also sits in an upright position, which I think gives him confidence and comfort while he's riding.  The double deck in the back is also great for another child to sit or stand on.

Yes, it is easily opened with one hand, but it seems that's where the convenience ends. If you want to use any of the assorted tools, it's somewhat labor intensive. First, you have to open the tool cover, select the tool you want, then pull it into the open position.\n\nThe problem I have stems from the fact that not all of the tools are easily opened individually. Pull one open and several of the others come out too. Depending on what tools come out, you have to be careful when pushing the unneeded tools back so as not to cut yourself. And no, I didn't, but it was close... ;-)\n\nI am way less than impressed with the locking mechanism. You have to make a conscious effort to ensure that any given tool is actually locked. Yes, another close call. By contrast, the tools on my Gerber are all easily accessible and are locked into position with (in my opinion) a better locking mechanism. In all it's years of use, I never had a single tool fail to lock automatically nor has the locking mechanism ever failed. Given, too, is the fact the with the Gerber, although it does take two hands to open a tool, I can unlock, put the tool away, retract the pliers and re-holster it single handedly.\n\nNow, I honestly bought this truly wanting to like it.

So, feeling pretty confident about my choice, I went online and ordered a Leatherman Wave.\n\nTurns out that Leatherman products are not what people make them to be! I was very disappointed with my Wave for a multitude of reasons, which I explained in detail in my review. The interesting thing is that I got a bunch of \"not helpful\" votes, which is quite funny, considering that a \"not helpful\" review is a review that is either too short, doesn't provide any real information, or is blatantly biased. Which was clearly not the case with mine. So I can only think that there is a good number of Leatherman fanboys who just don't like to see their favorite product criticized and react by childishly clicking \"not helpful\".\n\nThe reason why I'm telling you this is that when it comes to choosing a product for which there is a certain very popular brand, it might be hard to go against the current. But if you see how much of a difference there is between the two multi-tools, you might realize that sometimes it really pays off to go against the current.\n\nPretty much all the issues I had with the Leatherman are not issues with the SOG. The opening action is butter-smooth, and the pliers don't grind against the handle when closing the multi-tool. The tools in the handles come out VERY easily without having to do any \"break-in\" nonsense, or loosening the screws. The handles have smooth edges that make it very comfortable to use.\nAdditionally the SOG has a gear system for the pliers that multiplies your strength two fold. This can either allow people who doesn't have a lot of hand strength to use the pliers very effectively, or people who already have a lot of hand strength to use the cutters to cut almost anything that fits in them.\n\nOverall I'm extremely satisfied with this SOG, I have been using it for so many things, for working on my car to little repairs in the house. Even removing the butt-cap from a marker so that I could pour a little bit of rubbing alcohol in it and allow my wife to keep using it after it was spent.\nAlso did I mentioned that the SOG is actually cheaper than the Letherman Wave?\nYou really can't go wrong with this multi-tool. Sure it's a bit heavy, but that's the trade off to pay if you want to have a real multi-tool. If you want something lighter I would personally suggest looking into Suisse Army Knives instead. The great thing about a multi-tool is that you have a good set of pliers (needle-nose and regular) in your pocket.\n\nIf you have any question, let me know, I'm happy to help!

This is a major problem!\n\nThe picture that Amazon has shows an earlier model S60 that has the piano style locks and the hex head bolts rather than the allen key bolts. The shipping item is NOT as pictured, and as far as I can tell from SOG, the current model is the one with the single lock and the allen key bolts.. I'm sure the single lock is significantly cheaper to manufacture!\n\nAlso, the fit and finish of the S66N (purchased November 2015) compared to the S60N (purchased November 2014) is like a child toy. The S66N has razor sharp ruler markings and a beautiful finish. All the individual tools are shiny without any casting imperfections. The S60N's ruler markings are so faded/indistinct that they're almost unusable. The phillips screwdriver is a rough casting with poorly defined screw blades. The marlinspike has jagged burrs on it - it will ruin the rope of any knot you try to use it on.\n\nAlso, the cam/gear mechanism for the pliers is a very nice force multiplier, but it means that if you need to open the pliers particularly wide, the handles go out very far which may leave you with insufficient room/leverage to actually use the pliers... I would say that it is more common for me to wish that there was some way to turn the cam/gear mechanism off than for me to be thankful that I have the extra gripping power....\n\nI don't know if the S60N has always been inferior to the S66N or if SOG's manufacturing has just gone downhill, or if I just got a poor specimen.. However, I could live with the casting issues and I could live with the faded ruler, but the single lock is just a pile of steaming doodoo.", "summary": "Get An S66N Instead!

One important feature for me in a multitool is the pliers, and these are quite good.  As has been stated, the compound leverage give excellent gripping force.  The wire cutters are great.  My first test was to cut a coat/shirt hanger, that was done quite easily.\nI read complaints about multiple tools coming out when you pull one out, that's true.  They do.  The smaller tools are also a bit difficult to get out.  I have to use both hands to get any of them out... I don't know how you could do it with just one hand.  I like the tool covers as well, they work quite nicely to eliminate the pain of really cranking down with the pliers that you might experience with other multitools.\nPlease note, the complaints about the tools and the locking mechanism... very true.  When you pull out a tool, make sure every other tool is closed back in just right and then make sure your tool is locked. It's very easy to pull out the knife, push the other tools back, and forget to make sure the knife is then locked.  The \"piano style\" lock SnakeStrike77 mentions in his review, and as seen in the pictures would be very nice, but they don't exist on this model.  The single plate as seen in the video does.\nDavid Chesterman says the drive socket and bottle opener can come loose... that's no more true than for any other tool.  And the drive socket can actually lock in 2 positions, fully extended (like all the tools) and half extended (sticking out sideways)... though you can't close the tool if it's out sideways as it will hit the other handle\nJust a note on the case: initially I thought with the clip it may not stay on my belt all too well, I've had problems with those plastic clips just being too flimsy or something.  Not so... It stays quite well and is strong; and the bottom of the clip has a hook-like end and catches very well. I'm quite pleased with it also.\nOverall, good quality product.\nRated 4 stars for 3 reasons...\n1. The 'less-than-perfect' locking mechanism\n2. \"Clumpiness\" of tools and difficulty pulling out just the smaller tools (common annoyance).\n3. And an issue I had with one of the tool covers.

I got it because I loved the blade style. Now, after having used it for daily carry for 6 of the past 8 years (I got a Kershaw Cyclone, black, serrated blade about a year and half ago) I see several other benefits to it.\n\nFirst, I should probably make the distinction that this is a TACTICAL knife, not a FIGHTING knife. If you want a knife designed with fighting in mind, look at Gerber/Applegate's Covert folders, or Cold Steel's Ti-Lite. This knife was designed more for law enforcement than an assassin. As other reviewers have mentioned, the shark-tooth tip was a genius idea and perfect for punching into boxes and tough plastic packages before cutting. There's no doubt in my mind that you could do some serious damage to the human body with it, but its thicker Zytel handle and wider, thicker blade seem designed more for wood, rope, plastic, etc., all of which it handles very well.\n\nI really like the arc-lock, which is similar to some Benchmade knives. It opens and closes easily, yet it's very firm with no play or rattle when extended. As other reviewers stated, this knife can be opened in the blink of an eye, and I've made the mistake of frightening people when going to open a box. It does NOT have a spring or torsion bar - no assisted opening, the blade simply pivots easily when using a quick half-circle flicking motion.\n\nWhen they ask why I have to carry such a big knife I reply \"Because I never want to be caught with a knife to small to handle the job.\" I would call this a medium sized folder - there are many larger ones out there. It's easy to clip inside the pocket, and the stout handle doesn't make itself felt. When I got the knife, I lived in a different state where the blade length law on concealed knives allowed for 4\" blades. Since this is 3.9\", it was perfect.\n\nI still use the knife when I go camping or for outdoors activities (to save the black blade finish on my Kershaw). I also have a beautiful Cold Steel Triple Action tanto, but it's not practical for daily use. I have used the Pentagon Elite extensively and it still looks almost new. It's very well built and continues to function, (8 years later) like the day I got it.

I think it's skirting the lines of legality in my state because you can flip it open, but it's not a \"gravity knife\" -- it holds itself closed and it has a locking mechanism to hold the blade open, so it seems to fit within the letter of the law.\n\nThe \"shark tooth\" tip is a neat design idea that gives it a VERY sharp point, there are serrated edges towards the handle that help out if you're trying to cut through something like twine or wires, it has a belt clip if you're toting it around as a utility knife but is also small enough to easily fit within your pocket.\n\nIf you're looking for a good utility \"buck knife\" you might as well get something like this.  The flipping action and one-finger lock disengage means you can easily use it one handed and it seems rugged enough for everyday use in the tool belt.  No more dropping what you're doing so you can pry the blade out or safely close it, just a little wrist and thumb action will do it.\n\nEdit:\nI've had this knife for almost 2 years now and I still like it.  I use it frequently (primarily for cutting open boxes from Amazon... *cough*) and can't get enough of the wrist action on it.  It's so nice to be able to open and close it without having to pry the blade out 2-handed style like other utility knives.

Now it opens much easier.  I just unscrewed the hex bolts a little bit, and added some oil, and presto!  this thing looks usable now.  It's nice and compact and I can open the pliers with one hand.  Should have tried lubricating and loosening earlier.\n\nIt's still true (as I pointed out in my earlier review below) that it's useless when the plier head is not fully out; I had wrongly thought, from the marketing pictures, that you could actually grab things with the plier heads offset at an angle.\n\nBut now I can actually open the thing with one hand, and I can even get out the other tools, too, some of them with one hand.  Now that I don't have to apply nearly so much force, the knife blades don't seem as dangerous, though I still find it awkward.  But I still don't like the fact that the tools all come out clumped (like on SOG's other products, and unlike Gerber or Victorinox); it's hard to pull one out without pulling out more than one.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the tools do not lock.  For the most part, that's not a problem; plenty of other multitools do not lock either.  But it's actually dangerous for the awl, which is pointing the wrong way on this tool.  If you apply any force to the sharp side, it will fold in on you.  Definitely bad design; probably only usable for poking something, not working it around.  For the other tools, the lack of a lock is not a fatal flaw.\n\nFor reference, here was my old opinion, when I first got it:\n\nSOG products are hit or miss; some are really good, some are not.  This one is definitely not.\n\nI got it because I was intrigued by the offset pliers, hoping I could actually use them to get at things in awkward positions.  Turns out that does not work well if you have to apply any reasonable amount of force, because the act of squeezing the handles causes the plier head to rotate inward if it's not locked straight.\n\nOut of the box, the plier head was quite stiff, so it was very difficult to open it with one hand, or to close it with one hand.  I assume it will loosen up with use, but it was definitely not a one-hand opening plier out of the box for me.\n\nThe other tools (knife, etc.) are *really* hard to get out.  The knife in particular is almost impossible to get out without cutting myself.  I have a SOG power-assist multitool, and that works far, far better.  (In general, the other tools on SOG multitools, even the ones that I would consider good multitools unlike this one, are not all that fantastic, anyway; the can opener works much worse that can openers from Victorinox or Leatherman, and I much prefer the Victorinox files; but SOG knife blades are excellent, if you could get them out easily.)\n\nAs others have pointed out, none of the blades lock.  This might not seem so bad, except that they don't even snap out (like Victorinox knives); they simply rotate with no sort of catch at all.  And the even weirder thing is that the awl is oriented in the wrong direction, so if you actually use the sharp side, it will fold itself in.  A clear design mistake.\n\nAs usual with the SOG products, the materials *appear* to be pretty high quality, though I'll never know because the poor design precludes me from actually using this one for real.\n\nSorry, this multitool looked cool, but it's just not very functional for much of anything.  If you want pliers that can be opened with one hand, then you should get a SOG power-assist or power lock, or one of a number of Gerber multitools, or the leatherman OHT, or a CRKT zilla; but don't get the SOG paratool.", "summary": "Not as bad as I first thought", "unixReviewTime": 1408406400}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "08 7, 2014", "reviewerID": "A11Z1ISZY9M058", "asin": "B00004U9IY", "reviewerName": "Edmund Altair", "reviewText": "I have owned this multi tool for years. And while I love it, I can not say that I'm IN love with it. The pros for this tool are the Allen assembly that allows you to swap out tools, and completely disassemble the tool for cleaning. The plier heads can be angled to get into tight spaces. The overall design is ultra sleek, and lightweight.\n\nThe cons I found with this multi tool were odd, didn't affect it's daily use, and with care (and in my case brains :P) could easily be overcome. The tools don't actually 'lock' into place, when they fold out they seem to be held just by compression. This is fine for most uses but just be careful not to go trying to break a stubborn bolt loose, or you will ruin your knuckles. When using the pliers, think carefully about where you want your hands to go when the head folds up or down unexpectedly. I have used the angle headed feature maybe a handful of times, always just to grab something that fell, never to try and loosen something with it. I was slightly disappointed with the number of tools available from SOG to swap out. Sure a seatbelt cutter is awesome, but I feel that they really could use this design as a skunk works to test new concepts in what a multi tool could be. swap out all 5 tools on one side for a spring loaded window punch? Why not? Instead of pliers, have a RG45 crimper? Crazier things have been tried, and who knows maybe it changes the world of multi tool forever.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend the Paratool for anyone who needs a smaller, lightweight tool for tightening the occasional screw.

Leatherman is the granddad of multitools and likely offers the widest variety of multitools, but comparative shopping is a must.  The Schrade tool is awkward in that some of the tools lockout and some don't lock at all.  I am sure it is because some don't require lockout to work, but my opinion is that they should all lockout. I have two SOG multitools (Power Plier and a smaller version)and am very impressed with the heavy duty, anti-corrosive finish, precision, and function of all the instruments.

I needed to tie up part of the netting as it's a bit too lose and kept tangling the pucks, but it's a multipurpose net, so I can't complain. Setup was actually a little harder than I thought (I generally barely look at instructions) as I had to pull out a tape measure to figure out which piece was what, but otherwise, was a piece of cake. It's sturdy, stable (once I glue in those back pieces) and, for me, was an absolutely perfect purchase. It allows me to get some shooting exercise and practice my aiming. If you're using it for a game, it *is* rather light weight, but that also makes it great for me as I can move it around easily. I didn't give it 5 stars as, well, it's not perfect, but then perfect would cost a LOT more money, and I also don't have a wicked slapshot, so I'm not likely to shoot through the back of it.

The term boat is probably technically correct, but I consider the Explorer 100 more of an inflatable raft.\n\nThe key items for prospective buyers to be aware of, is that the Explorer 100 is a one person craft, with a rated capacity of 120 pounds, intended for pools and calm waters.  Its not recommended, but the raft could probably accommodate a couple of small children, as long as the weight limit is not exceeded.  Those heavier than 120 pounds, should probably look at the larger&nbsp;.\n\nThe bright orange material is great for visibility, and seems to be reasonably thick and durable.  The material  should stand up to sand at the beach, but probably isn't tough enough to withstand scraping against a rocky reef.  If you take this boat to the beach, you will need to be very careful.\n\nThe Explorer has two inflatable compartments.  The outer body of the raft is one compartment, while the second consists of the floor inside the raft.  While it is certainly possible to inflate the raft manually by using lung power, it is much easier to use some kind of pump.  Using a small foot pump, it takes me about 10 minutes to inflate the raft.  To avoid a slow leak, make sure that the plug is inserted very securely.\n\nThe raft comes with a short length nylon cord, which is practically useless as a tether line.  Most will probably want to upgrade this.  Unless you just want to drift or splash around, you will need some oars.  I bought a set of&nbsp;, which are well made, and not that expensive, if you can get them on sale.  The Explorer 100 has a nice set of plastic oarlocks, which are designed to work nicely with the Intex oars.\n\nThe price of the Explorer 100 seems to vary quite a bit, typically ranging between nine and fifteen dollars.  At the low end of the price range, it is a 5 star buy.  If you stick to a pool, and use this craft as it is intended, you will probably have lots of fun, and not have any major safety issues.  While the raft can certainly be used in the ocean, a lake, or other body of water, it isn't really intended for rough waters.  Overloading or inappropriate use, could have very unfortunate consequences, so safety should always be the number one concern.", "summary": "a small raft, that is great for pools, or in very calm waters", "unixReviewTime": 1388361600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2013", "reviewerID": "A1ATHO85C798DB", "asin": "B00004YTPE", "reviewerName": "Strang", "reviewText": "I bought this for river tubing in some gentle rapids.

The beach is only about a 15 minute walk from the house and sadly I bought the wrong item on Amazon, so we didn't have any ice for the cooler. We didn't have much to bring, so there were some cheese sticks, pretzels, etc. and some sodas in there.

Don't inflate them too hard, because\nit could hurt a little if it is hard as a rock.

Pen blade good for detail work.\n\nOrange peeler with flat head screwdriver--haven't had a chance to use the orange peeler, but the screwdriver (which fits no. 2) Phillips can't have torque put behind it.\n\nNail file with nail cleaner--this is the only nailfile Victorinox makes that still has a cut (metal file) style surface.  It files metal and nails equally well--which is excellently.  Nail cleaner doesn't work as well as on the 58mm series, but is an excellent No. 1 Phillips screwdriver.\n\nScissors--as to be expected with Victorinox scissors, they're excellent. They're also a bit larger, making them easier to use.\n\nPS--if you get a Swiss Army Knife 74mm with advertising, and the advertising is on the side of the blades, reverse the tools if you've removed them from cleaning and are used to the tweezers being on the cross side.

This measures about 19 inches from the black handle to the red base, while the hose comes to 40 inches. The red base has a flat surface with the two holes for the hose to be inserted. The hole to the left has the arrow pointing up indicating this is for inflating. The hole on the right side has the arrow facing down to be used for deflating items. The handle is easy to twist off and pull out. There is a plastic ring divider with two other black tubes in this suction cup container.\n\nIn order to maneuver the hose to fit into the intended slot it is necessary to squeeze it just so and jimmy it into the hole. The nozzles are attached to the top part of the hose and need to be fastened before sticking it in the hole of the item needing to be inflated.\n\nI have used it both with bare feet while indoors and with shoes on with no problems either way.  I also used this for an air mattress and it was a cinch.\n\nThere are times when we become over zealous with our pumping and cause the hose to pop out of the socket. In just a minute it can be fixed and pumping can resume.

I kind of resented that they went to plastic. I am no longer disappointed. The hardened steel drill guides are lifetime guaranteed. The plastic housings are substantially made, and thick enough to be very durable. All in all, a nice set. You get a three hole, that comes mounted on the jig. In addition, a two hole and a single hole are included in the set. Pocket, rocket or whatever they want to call them, it covers all three sizes and options so your ready to take on the world of pocket hole joinery, whether you use the jig mounted on the portable clamp to anything models that are included.\n This set sure saves a lot of time. You don't have to wait for hours, or overnight for the glue to set up. Also you don't have to contend with lots of clamps. The trade off is that you have to contend with the fact that their is a hole on the inside face of your work. They sell plugs in different types of wood to fill them. Then you chisel, sand, or whatever to get them flat. You could cut your own with a plug cutter. Do them deep, then cut them on a saw at the angle of the pocket hole jig. If you are exacting, you could glue them in flush. The other alternative, is in the case of kitchen cabinets, to attach the face panels, you cut your pocket holes,on the outside of the cabinet, so when they are joined together you do not see them.\n All in all, you can't beat the strength of the screw holding your piece together by itself, or as an internal clamp with gluing. If you use a finish nail, it holds for glue drying, as long as you don't move the piece very much. With the pocket hole, you can go right into the rest of your assembly.\n Additionally, you have the option of dry fitting your pieces. You cut to fit, then disassemble them for transport, and do final assembly on the job site. Great flexibility.\n It's a trade off using biscuits, or dowels, you get totally hidden joinery, but you have to wait for the glue to dry. For finish projects with all sides exposed, that is the way to go. Slidiing dovetails, take it a step further, and you not only have no holes to contend with, and the exposed dovetail is a signed marquee of your work.\n The Kreg Pro Pack comes with a very nice carrying case. One of the best cases I have seen. Well made, and the pieces fit well. It is ideal for keeping your jig in good shape, and keeping all of the components handy.\n As far as the screws are concerned. They come in different lengths. the 1 1/4\" thousand pack is good for the common 3/4\" woods. That way you get a 1/2\" bite into the adjoining material. The fine thread screws are for hardwood, and the coarse thread is for soft.\n I found the Kreg ProPack to be substantially made, and I expect that it will last for a lifetime of regular use. They do make a professional one that is the main unit only, which is made out of metal, and intended for production use, for about the same money as this complete pack.\n I have seen pocket hole jigs made out of hardwoods, I just don't think you are going to get the longevity out of them with a drill bit eating away at the sides. At least not as long as these with case hardened steel. I can see someone grumbling over the price versus the plastic, that is gnawing at me too, but the engineering and convenience of this kit, is well worth the money.

We just moved to a place with a small pond in our back yard and I thought this would be perfect to paddle around in.\n\nHoly cow is it impossible to steer!!!  I couldn't believe it.  I have experience with canoes and kayaks and I almost got stuck in our tiny little pond because the end of the oars kept unscrewing and there was too much give in the spot that holds the oars on the boat.  If you're experienced with row boats this might work out for you, but it was not fun for me.  I couldn't get home fast enough.\n\nThe bottom also ripped the first time we used it.  It was still pond-worthy (it just punctured one side) but it was unfortunate timing, and reminded me it was only a $20 boat.\n\nI also felt like I was going to fall into the water.  I've been in inflatable boats before but this one felt like it was going to sink at any moment.  This wouldn't have been a huge deal except it turns out that while the pond is pretty from far away, it's absolutely disgusting when you're sitting above it and I didn't want to touch the water, let alone swim in it.  So if you're in a bathing suit, that's great, but if you really actually don't want to get wet this may not be the boat for you.\n\nThe idea of it being a compact set is really nice.  It does come with oars, a manual pump, the boat and a string.  There aren't instructions, which isn't a big deal except for that the valves were stuck and the pump has a weird hose thing you're supposed to attach to it, which isn't obvious (it's closed at the end so it doesn't look like part of a pump).  If we'd looked at the box we would have figured it out sooner.  So I ended up using a meat thermometer to puncture the valve to get air into the boat, and using a different pump.\n\nBasically I ended up feeling like it was a total waste of $20, and my expectations were really pretty low.  I just wanted something I could row around in.  Now I'm thinking we may just spring for a kayak because this was decidedly not fun.

It is one of those valves that comes on any cheap float or tube you buy at the beach. The Intex River Run tube I bought for my granddaughter had a heavy duty inflation valve that you could unscrew and it would deflate instantly.

Two brothers use it together and independently to tool around a relatively small pool.  It's their favorite pool toy.

I didn't try the small included hand pump, but am glad to have it to keep by the pool for small inflatables needing a boost.  When using a bicycle foot pump, I did find I had to push right through the one way valve membrane to get it to attach well enough to fill the boat, so the valves are no longer one way and must be closed quickly.  This isn't a problem for us, and is a worthwhile trade off to be able to use a better pump.  It appears to be durable.
