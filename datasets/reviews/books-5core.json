I had to go back and reread it as soon as I finished it because it is so rich in historical and psychological  details, particularly themes centering on painful family dynamics and history.\n\nPotential readers of this novel by Claire Messud should know it isn't exactly a sunny, bouncy work. If you are looking for that you'll want to look elsewhere. It also moves between countries, including sections based in France, the U.S. and Algeria.\n\nThe focus of the novel is the LaBasse family and the story is told from the viewpoint of Sagesse, a woman who conveys the weight of a turbulent family history. Starting with Sagesse's grandfather, a man who owns the Hotel Bellevue in France,the family dynamics begin to play themselves out, connecting to larger themes of France and Algeria's history as well, with stunning consequences.\n\nSagesse's parents, Alex and Carol, reveal plenty about the kind of problems that can arise when there are cross-cultural challenges to face in a marriage. Carol, coming from America, marries Alex, but is unable to see the potential sacrifices and problems she'll face as she moves overseas to live with her husband...or the impact the marriage will have on her daughter and the rest of the family, including a handicapped son.\n\n It is a bit hard to categorize this book because it covers so many areas. It is part mystery because Sagesse is trying to separate truth from myth when figuring out her family's history. It is part suspense because of Sagesse's short love affair and a moment of violence (and I don't want to give the details of that moment or I'll spoil it for you). It is also a historical novel, rich with information about events in Algeria and France and the United States.\n\nFor me, also, this one centers on themes of personal identity and displacement,primarily for Sagesse, a woman trying to figure out where she belongs in the world and how to make peace with her difficult family as well as coming to grips with history's impact on her family.", "summary": "I'm a huge fan of the author and this one did not disappoint", "unixReviewTime": 1220313600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "13", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2000", "reviewerID": "A1T17LMQABMBN5", "asin": "0151004714", "style": {"Format:": " Hardcover"}, "reviewerName": "Caf Girl Writes", "reviewText": "What gorgeous language!

A jeweler has an emerald pendant for sale. Sharples believes this was part of the estate given to Shirley Bruce.

Lam sees Robert Cameron, the other co-trustee show up. Sharples is surprised and astonished to hear this news (Chapter 3). When Lam and Sharples go to visit Cameron, they find a dead body. They call the police from outside the house (Chapter 4). Sharples tells Sgt. Sam Buda that Cameron had no enemies (Chapter 5). The emerald pendant was there. The police investigate the jeweler and the stockbroker who was visited by Robert Cameron earlier that day (Chapter 8).\n\nLam visits Dona Grafton, who minded Cameron's crow when Cameron left the country (Chapter 11).

Though the plot seems straightforward and predictable, Zoey Dean sets up the conflicts wonderfully.

I had to pause, put the book down, and come back to it. After that break from the book, I couldn't put it down. When Taylor seemed naive and too trusting, Dean gave her enough wit to make her likable. As Taylor grew accustomed to manipulation and was veering to the dark side, I still cared about her.\n\nOverall, Hollywood is Like High School With Money is a light, satisfying read. I highly recommend it as a fun escape.\n\nPublisher: Grand Central Publishing (July 23, 2009), 288 pages.\n\nCourtesy of Hatchette Books Group.", "summary": "Fun, satisfying, summer read - would be hilarous movie!", "unixReviewTime": 1248739200}, {"overall": 2.0, "vote": "12", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "04 14, 2014", "reviewerID": "A3J3BRHTDRFJ2G", "asin": "0511189877", "reviewerName": "EJ Honda", "reviewText": "This remote, for whatever reason, was chosen by Time Warner to replace their previous silver remote, the Time Warner Synergy V RC-U62CP-1.12S.

A. Freeman", "reviewText": "Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.\n\nNow on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.\n\n Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI's\n\nTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.\n\npros:\nLarge screen\nterrific images\noutstanding volume\n\ncons:\ninability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and vias\na somewhat outdated POI information.\nNon-truck specific routings.\nCost.", "summary": "1st impression", "unixReviewTime": 1283990400}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "23", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2010", "reviewerID": "A28B1G1MSJ6OO1", "asin": "0528881469", "reviewerName": "A.

Just restarted it and it picked up on my route right where it should have. The exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely. I also love the multi-stop route planning and use it a lot. Updated regularly, it has shown me all the construction zones and has a feature to allow me to detour around them. Creating Groups and storing locations in them is a breeze so I can separate warehouse from store locations, etc.\n\nI'm running an HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 7 OS for the dock and update. The USB port DOES charge the GPS, at least with my laptop, despite the warning in a previous review. Even if it didn't, the supplied 12-volt and AC chargers take care of getting the battery up to speed.\n\nMy complaints are relatively minor:\n\nBattery life when it is unplugged isn't great. However, since I use it plugged in in the cab 95% of the time, it doesn't create too much of a problem.\n\nThe announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn't tell you (or show you on the map display) what state you are in and/or going into. Again, a minor issue because I know where I am but all my other GPS units had this feature. For $500 smackers, I don't expect this kind of slip-up.\n\nThere is a Micro SD slot on the unit and I bought a card for it. Unfortunately, the manual has absolutely no information on using it. The only reference is on the page showing the physical features of the unit, showing the position of the slot.

Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13' 8\" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13'6\" bridges.  The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  Other than this, I love the fact that:  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),  2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).  3) large 7\" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving  4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.  5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  Many times I have gone into areas that it said \"Construction Ahead\" and no construction is being done because it has been completed.  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  But still most of the time 95% it is correct.  7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. You reset every day manually.  Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn't distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  I just manually configure at the end of the day.  The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.  8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  You reset manually when completed.  9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)  11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)  12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)  13) it tells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.  14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  saves info for 1 year.

I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6\" bridges when I'm 13'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.", "summary": "Great grafics, POOR GPS", "unixReviewTime": 1290556800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2015", "reviewerID": "A1QXXAR7PIGHO2", "asin": "0545105668", "style": {"Format:": " Paperback"}, "reviewerName": "Javier Unzueta", "reviewText": "Daughter thought it was a good read.", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1437350400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2015", "reviewerID": "A1TIQNQJZ2LDNW", "asin": "0545105668", "reviewerName": "Chris Gregory", "reviewText": "Roland Smith's account, one of life for a teenage English/American boy in Burma, is marketed as a story for youth.

Elephant Run is set during World War II in Burma, which is located in Southern Asia. The main character is 14-year-old Nick Freestone who lived in London, England. After Nick's parents' apartment was destroyed during the German bombing of London, Nick's mother and father both decided it would be safest to send Nick to Burma to stay with his dad on a plantation to get away from the bombing.\n\nAfter a few days in Burma, the Japanese forces attacked their plantation, taking Nick's father as a prisoner of war, leaving Nick to stay with the rest of the Burmese who were given the choir of building an aircraft hanger for the Japanese. Nick finds a way to escape with the help of a Burmese monk of high importance. The monk's niece joined them on their escape. Once they had left the plantation without being spotted, they hitched a ride on a couple of elephants and rode them over to the prison site where Nick's dad was being held.\n\nThanks to the help of a Japanese friend, Nick's dad was able to escape, too. While all four of them were escaping, two guards who were patrolling the prison gates spotted them. The elephant that had assisted Nick on his journey to the prison camp saw that the guards were wearing tiger pelts around their necks. The elephants, thinking that they were a threat because of the tiger pelts draped around their necks, charged the guards and killed them. Nick, his dad, and the monk's niece all were able to find refuge from the war in Australia.\n\nI thought that Elephant Run was a great book.  It was very suspenseful and it held my attention all the way through.

It was exactly the same size, shape, color and weight.  The only difference was the printed details in the charger.  The print was brighter and crisper in the original, but it was also decent in the new one I purchased.  Also, the QR code in the original was missing in the new one.  Finally, the hinge mechanism in the folding prongs was a little different, but the \"feel\" of folding and unfolding the prong was exactly the same.  With the USB cable, there was virtually no difference whatsoever.\n\nSo, I finally plugged it in and the tablet immediately recognized it and charged.  I honestly do not see any other difference.  If it came in an original Nook box, I would definitely proclaim it to be original.  Maybe it was from a company that bought them in bulk (it definitely looked brand new) and resold it, or maybe it was from the same China factory who manufactured them for B&N and decided to sell units outside their agreement.

There wasn't a lot of plot or character depth here.\n\nAlso, I found Betts' vampires to be extremely boring. It's like True Blood vampires Disneyfied. Her vampires are out in the open publicly and drink synthetic blood called \"NuBlood\" (hmmmmm). Other than that, they don't act like vampires at all. I like my vampires to have a little bit of bloodlust, a little edge... Eric Northman is sexy, these vampires were just BLAH.

The first one is the lightest, the second one gets a little more serious as it involves the involuntary changing of a man with a terminal illness.  The third story is one for Angelina herself, and it is the most serious (in an obvious \"It's a Wonderful Life\" sort of way).\n\nThe background for the stories is that it is a given that vampires have been accepted as real, and overall are integrating into society.  There is very little blood lust/blood sucking going on (well, yes, from those Icky Criminals in the third story, but overall it's all very sanitary).\n\nThe author did a great job of setting the background in an unobtrusive way, and then just giving us the stories.  If the author was so inclined, she could easily expand into full length novels where we could learn the hows and whys of the world, but really she does a great job giving us just enough that she can stick to the shorter tales, and the shorter tales feel complete.  And naughty.  Did I mention naughty?  These are a little naughty.\n\nGreat little set of stories if these are what you are in the mood for.

It was at a time that I was desperately seeking books from Christian authors I'd never read before. The book impressed me, but I hadn't read anything else by Nichols, but this book made up for lost time. Nichols is a great storyteller.\n\nI'm a bit critical about the \"Christian\" message in books, mainly because it's often heavy-handed. Most of the \"conversions\" are contrived and the characters have to twist into some awkward positions in order to see Jesus. In this book, however, the theme of redemption is woven in each scene. Each character discovers God's redemptive power in their own way. Also, Nichols has a way with finding a scripture and creating a moving story around it. She beautifully illustrates the promise of Matthew 10:29.\n\nThe pacing was great, also. I only found myself skimming twice, mainly at the end of chapters because I was eager to know what happened next. Some parts of the plot seemed predictable when I began the book, like Samantha's life as troubled teen and Jonah's situation. Nichols, however, takes these time-honored roles and made them interesting enough to keep me turning the pages.\n\nMost of all, I think I enjoyed the book because it touches on the topic of ministerial burn-out. It is something that happens in church often but no one really seems to offer any solutions. The book, even thought it's a fictional account, shows a pretty realistic picture of how ministers get trapped in doing the Lord's work but not hearing from Him. I found myself going from rooting for Alistair to turn things around to being angry that he couldn't see how far he'd gone from what God intending.\n\nMore than once while reading this book, I had to force myself to stop reading in go to bed.

It is the type of book that reminds a person why they started reading Christian fiction books to begin with.  Linda Nichols touched on a variety of topics highly relevant in today's society including meth addiction, child abuse, and depression.\n\nHer story follows a young woman who flees her own personally bad situation and ends up in a small town where she shortly ends up employed as a nanny at a local parsonage where the pastor is not only the leader of a church but a high-profile Christian in many media outlets.  Everyone in this story needs help in some form or another, and even \"Christians\" are having trouble appreciating their faith anymore.

I know I have read the first few pages of this before and I'm thinking it was a contest that Dave Long held on conversion experience. It was so gripping then that I remember it to this day.\n\nThis story is very unique and, yet, it is the oldest story since time began because we all get caught in Satan's web of seduction, we all think there is no way out, we all bargain with God at one time or another, we all get angry at circumstances and must fight to forgive our loved one's choices, and we all find out sooner or later that only God can cure all ills, heal all wounds and change all hearts... if we just allow Him the elbow room to do it.\n\nThis story is very well-woven. The characters are first rate developed and we see personalities clash in a most believable way. What I love most about this story is that every character grows, blossoms, and finds sure footing on their life path.\n\nThe main character, Bridie Collins, is worn out from the bad choices she has made. One day, she's had enough of buying ingredients for cooking meth and being the maid for two slothful drug dealers, so she bides her time until they both crash from too much of a bad thing. She steals the drug money and makes her getaway, calling a hot tip line to make sure that Jonah is arrested and put safely away so he won't come after her. The drug money is stolen so her plans for getting far, far away go awry. She settles in Virginia. Bridie is not her real name, it is her mother's. Somehow, taking on the name of her mother settles her spirit and infuses her soul with a modicum of peace. She is still running away from her bad choices and not facing the music, but we realize that she has some spiritual growing to do before that can happen. It may be the middle of winter, when snow swirling around, but what a garden grows in the little family that is blessed with her.\n\nThere are a couple of things that distract somewhat, and keep this story from being 5+ stars. When the paths of Bridie and Jonah part, we follow Bridie and then we're jerked from that story into the jail cell of Jonah. It does not lend to the storyline at all knowing what Jonah is thinking. The tension is better built with the fear from Bridie rather than Jonah's intentions. Also, there isn't a thing added to the storyline by knowing what Jonah's attorney is thinking or that she finally winds up out of the public defender's office and in the prosecutor's office. Those were major distractions.\n\nIn my opinion, it doesn't matter how excellently a story is written if we are led down dead end paths which do not include the protagonist. In crafting a believable story, the writer should understand that the reader feels cheated and bewildered when we don't know where we're going, there isn't any light at the end of the tunnel, and we're in the company of a character we do not know.\n\nBut don't let that keep you from buying this book for your Keeper Shelf. It is an extremely good character study of a pastor who is man-called, not God-called and of a woman who is coming to terms, with God's help, with her bad choices and how God works in our lives for those who love Him and are called according to His purpose.

This is not a book about using (just) your MacBook - but, rather, a Snow Leopard-specific introduction to using any Mac.  The only thing that is really MacBook specific - vs iMac or Mac Pro - is the brief illustration that shows what the various ports are.\n\nThis book is only for you if you have an Intel Mac running Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6).\n\nNote, too, that every Mac comes with iLife, yet this book does not make mention of any of the iLife applications.\n\nWhile beautifully laid out and illustrated with screen captures, the editorial content of the book seems to have not been reviewed by a Mac expert, as there are numerous issues throughout that are either awkward, or not appropriate for a typical user.\n\nIn the first pages,  the author notes the use of context menus via clicking a right mouse button, but does not note that with certain Apple mice, the right button must be enabled in the System Preferences first.  He then talks about control-clicking (the way to get a secondary click with a single / left mouse button) on the trackpad - and does not mention the more convenient trackpad methods until much later in Chapter 8.\n\nHe notes that folders can be dragged to the dock, but does not point out that they can only be dragged to the right side of the dock only.  This is unfortunately typical of the almost-correct instructions throughout the book that a knowledgeable reviewer / editor might have helped smooth out.\n\nOn page 23, in a sidebar box called \"Remember your Gestures!\", Ray talks about four-finger swipe, etc., on the trackpad - but he does not introduce these until pages 213-214 in Chapter 8.  Even there, they are not adequately described.  Sort of hard to \"remember\" them on page 23 if you don't see it for another 200 pages.\n\nChapter 2 contains way too much information on extremely unusual network situations, breaking the flow of the whole book.  Most of the content of this chapter belongs in an Appendix in my opinion.  Much later, on page 150, Ray talks about sharing an internet connection in a way that most users would not understand ... or require.\n\nChapter 10 describes MobileMe backup before the more fundamental Time Machine backup.\n\nThe description of the keychain, which saves passwords, does not mention the importance of a secure login password to protect the (login) keychain.  Describing Address Book, Ray implies that a name can only be a member of one group, not describing dragging into multiple groups and opt-clicking on a name to see which groups it belongs to.  The description of displaying calendars in iCal is incorrect - suggesting that selecting a calendar displays its content, rather than checking the checkbox next to it.\n\nThe section on external monitors does not describe the designed-for-MacBook 24\" Apple display or how to operate with the laptop lid closed and with the external monitor as the only active monitor.\n\nThe Time Machine pages do not describe at all how to restore files - or how Time Machine can intelligently recognize certain applications, such as Mail, iCal or Address Book and restore individual mail messages, addresses, etc.\n\nSo, after not describing fully or correctly many of the basics of using Snow Leopard, Ray then goes into describing how to access the LaunchDaemon lists to delete services, something that most users should stay far away from.\n\nThe description of installing a new hard drive (to replace the existing one) is unrealistic unless the drive is dead - suggesting that one reinstall Snow Leopard from the original installation disks.  There is no mention of the more normal choices of (1) boot from the install disk and do a full restore from your Time Machine backup disk, or (2) attach the new disk via a USB or firewire cable and clone the old disk onto the new one before physical installation.\n\nThere is nothing in the book on how to burn data onto a CD or DVD via a Finder Burn Folder.  There is no mention of how to create a zip file (via the Compress command in the file context menu).\n\nIn summary, a lot of good content that is beautifully displayed, however there are also a lot of errors and omissions and inappropriate material.", "summary": "Snow Leopard Visual Guide with a little bit of MacBook thrown in", "unixReviewTime": 1273276800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2014", "reviewerID": "ARYLS99FST9SY", "asin": "0789743035", "style": {"Format:": " Kindle Edition"}, "reviewerName": "Bob in Tampa", "reviewText": "In my opinion this book is a  better value than \"Macbook Pro for Dummies\".

It is really about the OS, and it does a beautiful job introducing the power of OSX 10.8. Almost every page of the book contains numerous full-color illustrations that hold the reader's hand while marching them through operations on the Mac. I am experienced in printing costs, and I wonder that a book so laden with color can be offered to the market at such a reasonable price. It also happens to be very well laid out. Clean and simple. You can read it in a crowded, noisy restaurant and follow the argument easily.\n\nThe review before mine notes that some of the illustrations are so small as to be difficult to read.

Yes, there are warts, but they are few and not consequential.\n\nIf you need a compendious OSX 10.8 resource, I would recommend David Pogue's \"Missing Manual.\" If you need to dip your head quickly and effectively into the features of Mountain Lion, I heartily recommend this book.\n\nBe warned, though, that this is not a beginner's book.

I had a tight space between a desk and window to mount the TV so I wanted something that could move and this fit the bill. I was a little worried about the one stud mounting design but I made sure to find my stud properly in the wall with a stud finder and use a small nail to poke the wall to find the true edges of the board. Once I did that it was some measure to find where it would sit on the wall as far as TV height. Measure twice and drill once. I drilled the holes for the bracket on the wall starting with the top hole and using a level when marking the bottom hole. I put the lag bolt in the top hole first part way and then again used the level when putting the bottom bolt. Before tightening it down all the way I used the level one last time to get it level to my comfort level. Was done the bracket felt solid on the wall. I then mounted the bracket on the TV with fit perfect on the VESA mounts without using the extension arms that came in the kit. The kit was missing one bolt of the M8-15 bolts but luckily the M8-30 bolts fit into the bottom holes of my TV without being too long so I didn't have to contact Amazon about the missing bolt but was a little disappointed about that. Some quick screw driver work on the mount was on with the washers provided. I adjusted the tilt of the mount to face the TV down for my situation and realized I got it backwards once we lifted the TV but that was just an honest eyeball mistake. Some quick turns with the provided allen wrench to adjust the tilt and back on the wall it went. I tighten the one mounting bolt that holds it on and we are good to go. I adjusted the arm to where I wanted the TV and it felt was very solid. The articulating arms were a little stiff without the TV on their but once I put the 35lb TV on it moved fine, done want a loose swing mount. I didn't experience any sagging or off level issues. It is a two person job for heavy TVs to mount them but I did all the mount work on the wall and TV alone and only needed help with lifting the TV on to the wall when ready. Comes with an assortment of mounting bolts for the different TV holes, wrench, and allen wrench. You will need a drill and some drill bits for pilot holes.

I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs. I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it. (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.\n\nNow that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine. Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims. I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install. Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem. The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force. Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.\n\nI won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises. An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount. If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it).

I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs.  I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it.  (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.\n\nNow that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine.  Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims.  I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install.  Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem.  The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force.

I have installed many different types of mounts, so I have a lot of experience with them.  The quality is decent, but there are some items of which you should be aware:\n\n* If you have a 600x400 VESA pattern mount on your TV (as I did for a 37\" LG), then be aware that the extension arms are \"maxed out\" at this size, which means you have zero flexibility.  Unfortunately for my TV, the center plate onto which the extension arms attach completely covered the inputs I needed to use.  This isn't completely the VideoSecu's problem, but since there is no flexibility at this size, I had to rig it together off-centered only using two screws on the bottom arms.\n\n* All of the mounts I have ever done have a tilt function, and this is by far the biggest pain I've ever dealt with.  Instead of using thumb screws, you have to use a wrench (cheap one included) to adjust the tilt.  It is much more difficult to get the TV held in place and tighten this way.\n\n* Similar to the above, the mount gives the ability to adjust leveling after it has been installed.  This is also done with a wrench, but it is a big pain and is very difficult to keep level (keeps slipping) even with a helper.\n\n* Lastly, be aware that when folded completely, the screen is not centered over the wall mount.  It is about 2-3\" to the left or right, depending on which way you fold the arms.  If you're looking for the flexibility of full motion but most of the time it will be against the wall, keep this in mind.", "summary": "No flexibility for 600x400 VESA pattern, Slips Easily", "unixReviewTime": 1389657600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2014", "reviewerID": "A3TAT80JCWYGB4", "asin": "0972683275", "reviewerName": "Mark A.

I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn't be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. So I found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews. I could not be more pleased.\n\n1) PRICE - If you were to go to the big electronics store (BB) or the big box monster (WM) you would pay hundreds. I can't fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Does it cook dinner for me? Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?\n\n2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It articulates to the left, to the right. It pans, it tilts. One small negative.....the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless. I took them off.\n\n3) WHATS IN THE BOX - Normally I would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case I was so impressed I felt it was worth mentioning. It comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall. Last but not least are the VESA adaptors (which I did not need)\n\n4) WHAT YOU NEED THAT ISN'T INCLUDED -  Pencil / Level / Stud finder / Phillips screwdriver / Drill w/ a 7/32 drill bit / Socket wrench w/ a 13mm attachment.\n\n5) CONCLUSION - This is a no brainer.

That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).\n\nI knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?\n\nOption #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.\n\nOption #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.\n\nOption #3. Install a stud.

It mounts with a VESA 400 x 200 pattern, which is in the product description for this mount, but was not clear from the 3 options given in the documentation. To mount 400 x 200 you need to attach the extensions horizontally. For some reason this possibility isn't mentioned as one of the three options A, B, C which all have the extensions going out diagonally. The mount itself is 200 mm high, so you just need to extend it out to the sides. Another reviewer mistakenly thought it was not possible to mount a 400x200 TV (understandably given the documentation), so I wanted to leave this info here for anybody who needs it.\n\nMy basement room is wood paneled with 3/4\" knotty pine, but there was no stud close to the location I needed the TV. So I attached another 3/4\" wood mounting plate to the panelling with 6 construction screws, then attached the mount to that with the included lag bolts. The total thickness is now 1 1/2\" and feels very solid. I even was able to attach a Roku box to the mount with a couple of rubber bands which keeps it out of the way, but the IR remote still works.\n\nAs far as cons: the only one is that it's a bit stiff to move around. However, if like me you're just going to set it and leave it, that should be no big deal. All in all highly recommended for a solid, but inexpensive mount.", "summary": "Works perfectly for 400 x 200 VESA mount Hiteker 37\" TV to wood paneled wall.", "unixReviewTime": 1357776000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2013", "reviewerID": "A3CCITVF0WL6KE", "asin": "0972683275", "reviewerName": "A.

Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won't get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.\nNot so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).  They do get kudos for providing all the screws for all VESA types as well as a regular and an Allen wrench.\nThree stars for ease of installation, five stars for usability, for a combined four stars.

I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)\n-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!\n-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.\n\nCONS:\n-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my <30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.\n-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.\n-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit \"off level\" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.\n\nCONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the <$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.", "summary": "It works!", "unixReviewTime": 1306800000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2011", "reviewerID": "A3KSID0WUMUHZG", "asin": "0972683275", "reviewerName": "Jon", "reviewText": "As long as you know how to use a level, a stud finder, a drill, and a wrench you can easily install this mount.

There is a top screw on the middle joint that can be removed.  Then mount the bracket to the TV.  Then put the middle section back together by simply sliding it onto the post it came off of.  I don't travel with the TV mounted in the RV so I take it off and put it on this same way and never struggle at all.  Another review talked about the mount being out of square with the TV.  This mount is endlessly adjustable and the tilt and pitch both of the TV can be adjusted.  All in all this is a solid mount with endless adjustments.

I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.\n\nThe first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.\n\nThe first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren't recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.\n\nThe second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they're situated rather high and central. Either way, it's something you'll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.\n\nI actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company.

Think of an electronic copy complete with inserts, as it existed when published. The quality is never less than a VERY GOOD quality print edition and most are EXCELLENT quality. I have never been unable to read something or found a bad picture.\nBondi is the software system that allows you to \"read\" the magazines. Searching is not a major problem. Simple searches produce very good results. Do a search for Grahan Wilson or a playmate and the returned information is excellent. Try looking for a dimly remembered story and returns may not be very good. I have no more problems using the Bondi reader than I have with the reader for the New Yorker or National Geographic and the search results are compatible. I have had the Playboy 50s through two PCs and the change from Windows to VISTA. Bondi supported their reader with a download that installed with no problems.

Works perfectly and picture quality is amazing.  It should work perfectly for your device as long as you have slimport (Nexus 4/5/6, LG G2/G3, Nexus 7 2013, others) and use a good quality HDMI 1.4 cable.  To my knowledge, Samsung phones DO NOT support slimport.  If your phone supports slimport, you are much better off buying this adapter compared to MHL adapters which require power input.\n\nI was looking to buy a HTPC or setup a small itx box for running XBMC/TVMC/Kodi on my non-smart Plasma TV, but realized I had a Nexus 5 with a broken screen that was still functional.  Instead of spending a lot of money on an HTPC box, I decided to try out this slimport adapter with my Nexus phone paired with the TVMC Kodi app to stream movies.  I'm happy to say I've found the perfect solution for my needs.\n\nI previously tried using a chromecast for mirroring my Nexus phone, but the input lag and reduction in quality didn't cut it.  Audio was a little off sync with chromecast also.  I haven't noticed any input lag, display problems or artifacts with this slimport adapter at all. Audio over hdmi works through the slimport adapter just fine.\n\nThere are many generic style and older slimport adapters for sale on amazon that are problematic, but after reading the reviews of this particular one and using it myself, I can vouch for it.\n\nOne little tip I'd like to add if you plan to use this slimport adapter with a smartphone for TVMC/Kodi is to download the Yatse remote app.  You can use your OTHER phone as a remote over wifi to control the device attached to the slimport adapter.

This does not mean it will charge your phone at the same time too.  On some phone it will charge your device (G4). Now #2 this one is important, you have to put your phone on airplane mode in order not to lose connection from your device to your TV.  If you don't do this video from your phone to the TV will be cutting in and out all the time or won't display it at all.  On some phones it might work without using airplane mode.

I ordered the \"Kingston\" 64GB uSD card, because the \"SanDisk\" engineers acknowledge that their 64GB card can only be formatted as \"exFAT\". There is currently a problem with any of the Galaxy family devices running Android 4.0 or higher, they can not use or format a card with \"exFAT\". There is a firmware upgrade available from Samsung that will fix that, but they are not pushing it to your device because they say it's not ready for prime time yet, so you have to go to the website and pull it yourself, and use it at your own risk. The alternative is to do what I did, which was use my Linux machine to reformat the Kingston card as \"Win95 FAT 32 (LBA)\". The (LBA) part is important, as that will let you address the full 64GB minus a little overhead for address translation. The only drawback I see is that it's a little bit slower, and you can't store any individual files that are over 4GB in size (personally that's not a problem, as I don't need any single files anywhere near that size on my tablet).\n\nAddendum 2: The Samsung Galaxy forums, and Android forums, are saying that the Galaxy S3 (only the S3) running \"Jelly Bean\" (Android 4.2) will read and format \"exFAT\" cards. A further caveat is that if you use the card encryption setting, or want to use the card in recovery mode, it can only use \"exFAT\". What this means to other Galaxy devices, if and when they get upgraded to \"Jelly Bean\", remains a mystery.\n\nAddendum 3:  Someone bitched at me for not having my facts correct, so I decided to add this addendum.  Here are the facts:  My original facts were correct, in fact straight from the horses' mouth.  The engineers at SanDisk at first simply said \"You Can Not Reformat The Chip\", then later admitted that there was a manufacturing flaw.  If you have a chip manufactured after Jan. 2013, you can reformat it, if you have one manufactured before that, they will replace it for free.  Please note the date on my original review was Feb. 2013, we didn't know about the updated chips at that time, and I apologize.  All I can say is, if you're sure you're getting one of the newer chips, go ahead and try it ... also, go to the SanDisk website and read it for yourself, there's some caveat about the date on the packaging, an old chip could come in a package with a newer date, or some such thing.\n\nBottom line (as far as this review goes) is ... the \"Kingston\" 64GB uSD card will let you swing both ways, while the engineers at SanDisk say that (some of) theirs will not.", "summary": "Need to reformat for Galaxy devices running Android 4.0 or higher, so SanDisk won't work", "unixReviewTime": 1363132800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2013", "reviewerID": "A2V12OD21UJAHL", "asin": "106171327X", "reviewerName": "nickff", "reviewText": "Bought this for my EVO 4G LTE.

As you may know, space is precious when you're talking about military gear. We were very strict on what we could or could not bring on the deployment. Also I need something that could go a long time on a single charge. None of the full tablets were going to cut it and than I discovered the paper white. It claims that you can go several weeks on a single charge (or was it months) I can't remember since it's been son long. There were times on my last deployments where we went almost a month without any electricity. After a successful deployment I can defiantly say that this nook proved it was up to the task. I don't think I charged it more than twice and the second charge was just because I had the time and means. The tablet was also very well built. As you may know, Iraq has lots of sand. There were even a few times where I dropped the tablet in the sand. The device kept on trucking and did not give up.\n\nAfter my deployment I put it away in a drawer and forgot about it until I discovered it after I recently moved to my new town house.

I have the 9\" one, so have moved the review over here.  Some things have been brought to my attention since that have prompted this edit.  I bought this device because the large screen, the sharp display, the expandable memory and the light weight were all attractive.  Prior to buying this Nook I had a Sylvania SYTAB7MX.  I had bought it to get a feel for how tablets operate.  It had limited capability, but it was cheap and served me well for about a year.  Since it was only running Android 2.0 I was excluded from a lot of apps.  I finally decided to update to the Nook.  I had several unpleasant surprises and one pleasant one.\n1. I found that there is no way to be rid of numerous crapplications that come on the Nook and take up memory that could be better used elsewhere.  The Sylvania had fewer of them and there was a way to remove unwanted ones there.\n2. I am a member of Amazon Prime and was looking forward to viewing movies on this device due to its large screen and very good graphics.  When I logged into Amazon and selected a movie to view I got this: \"Amazon Instant Video uses Adobe Flash.  We can take you to the Adobe website where you can quickly install the latest free version of the Flash.\"  Sure.  I'd go for that.  So I went to the Adobe site and got this: \"We're sorry.  This content requires Adobe Flash Player, which is not supported by your device...\"\nNow, thanks to a comment by Torrey Pines on my earlier review, I have learned that there is a workaround.  It requires first using Google Play on the Nook to download and install the Firefox browser application.  Then go to [...] and download and install the \"browser plugin\" application.  Although it is called a browser plugin, it comes from Adobe and is a Flash plugin.  This website downloaded the app to my library but did not install it.  I contacted Barnes and Noble support and learned that I just had to turn the device off, turn it back on and click on the browser plugin icon on the start screen and it will install.  I contacted support through this page: [...]  You send them your phone number by e-mail and someone from support will call you back.  I got called back in less than a minute.  I found this impressive.\nFor some reason, the browser plugin will not work with the Chrome browser that is supplied on the Nook HD+.  After you install Firefox and the browser plugin and select a video to play it will first ask you if you want to use Chrome or Firefox.  You must select Firefox.  Then a gray screen will come up with a single icon in the middle with the usual \"Play\" icon.  Underneath it says to select that icon to activate the plugin browser.  Videos then play nicely.  Volume is less that when playing Netflix (which does not use the browser plugin but does require the Netflix app), but adequate.\n3. The Barnes and Noble web site says that this Nook has \"dual stereo speakers\".  I doubt this is true, but if it is, they \"speak\" out of a perforated area of the case measuring about 1.5\" x .5\" - hardly my idea of stereo.  The sound is clear and clean, however.\n4. My wife's Galaxy Tab has a way to override the limitation on whose apps you can download.  As far as I can see, there is no way to do this on the Nook HD+.\nThe positive surprise was that I discovered the Nook has a nifty voice-command capability.\nI am amazed that, in spite of having spent two hours reading reviews on the Amazon and Walmart and on two sites that specialize in tablet reviews prior to purchasing it, I found nothing to suggest most of the problems I found with this device.  Having read some more reviews since first having published this review, the only place I have seen that would have tipped me off to the inability of the native Nook to play Flash video was on the site for Amazon instant video where they list the capable devices.\nI found reviewers who say the Nook HD+ only has one speaker, but the B&N site says stereo.  Who was I to believe?\nMy main complaints now are items 2 and 5 above.

I got my nook as a hand-me-down from my girlfriend's father who bought it and almost immediately realized he had no use for it. It's been sitting around the house for about two years now, getting extremely occasional use. Recently I've found myself in a situation where I have to purchase e-books regularly because many of my favorite authors are releasing novellas or short story collections without print versions, and this has come in extremely handy.\n\nNow that I've been using it more, I have to say I'm incredibly impressed by how well this technology that was designed in 2011 holds up today. I have zero complaints about it, hardware or software. I doubt I'll feel even the slightest urge to purchase a newer e-reader until this one bites the dust. The text is clear and crisp. The device itself is lightweight, feels good in the hand, and is pretty much the exact size and shape I would want--not too big, not too small.\n\nThe software works perfectly for how I use it. The touchscreen works better than you'd expect. I've had no issues typing on it in the rare cases where I do need to type, and everything is simple to navigate. One minor touch I love is that when the device sleeps or when you lock it the screen shows a classy black and white drawing of a famous author. I'm sure the Kindle has something similar.\n\nOne thing people might be frustrated by is that you can't just buy a book off Amazon and have it automatically sync over wifi or whispernet like you can with a Kindle. For me, that's not a problem. I rarely buy e-books. Usually, like I said, it's a new novella from a favored author which doesn't happen that frequently. Otherwise it's typically books I got from a humble e-book bundle. Since Amazon wouldn't automatically sync those to a kindle even if I had one, I've settled into using calibri to manage my e-book library and transfer over usb to my nook with the proper metadata and in the proper format (calibri can convert anything to anything and keeps the original intact). For those wondering, you CAN buy the kindle version of an e-book on amazon and get it on your nook using calibri fairly easily.

The Sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center, which is perfect placement.  I read the great reviews on the nook and for the price, I thought it was worth a try.  I'm also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general.  I don't need wifi on my ereader but it looks like they're all offering it now.  I also don't appreciate my registration info being used by B&N as permission to start emailing me crap - I am already unsubscribed from that 'service'.  I'm definitely not happy with the nook and I'm going to save up my money to buy another Sony.\n**UPDATE 5/25/13**  I finally was able to download library books onto my nook but it was frustrating and time consuming; I finally found help online.  I have yet to discover a way to comfortably hold this book in my left hand and turn the page.  This was a very bad buy for me.  I bought a book-style cover for it and that was a waste of money as well as I find the cover just gets in the way.

As this could have been labeled as my fault, that I did not pay enough attention to the casing, I did not try to send it back. Plus, I had to take my card out from inside the device somehow. I decided to open the device and forget about warranty to be able to get the card out. I tried to align the casing of the card reader, but instead I managed to break it entirely.

Even better, memory card integration is seamless.\nAmazon's got a great price, too. $10 cheaper than anyone else. Ironic, considering the Nook is their direct competitor.\nOne thing to take into consideration is that the page numbers are synced with the actual pages of the ebook, regardless of font size or line spacing, so you can turn through page 85 two or three times before getting to page 86. It's a little weird, but not a major issue.\nI got my paws on one of these things in the store, and I'm still surprised at how light and small it is.\nThe last consideration (not really an issue, but an odd choice on their part) is the lack of a file manager on the device. You have to plug the Nook into a computer to delete files.

All the books I buy are from Amazon, and so with the nook it won't sync those which is unfortunate.  But where it shines is when I refuse to buy a book because the publishers are being greedy (eg, Dance with Dragons by George RR Martin, game of thrones series...  The ebook costs more than a physical copy.  It even costs more than a physical copy translated into another language!  Give me a break!)  So anyway, when it comes down to piracy to keep the publishers in check - the nook is great.  You plug it into USB, it shows up as a drive on the computer.  You type in the name of a book into google and add \"epub download\" to the end, and somewhere on the first page of results is a working download (at least with every book I've had to try so far.)  Download that straight to the nook's drive letter and you're done.\n\nThe main reason I wanted it originally, before I found out how incredibly easy the above was, was because of the shape and feel.  I love the shape and feel over the kindle.

It now seems like fraudulent advertising because I've since read that the MSRP is $79.99\n\nInitially I had serious problems with the Nook, and requested a refund. The seller, BlueProton, refused to take returns or give a refund for it, and directed me to Barnes & Noble who referred me back to the seller, stating  that the seller should refund it within 14 days; at that time  I'd only had it a few days. My Amazon A to Z claim ended with Amazon siding with the seller, BlueProton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on Nooks - something I did not see when I initially read their policy!\n\nBecause neither BlueProton nor Barnes & Noble would take responsibility for the defective product, and their attitude was \"Take the money and run!\", I'm giving the Nook a low review although later I found an update for the Nook which resolved the problems - with no help or information from either seller or Barnes & Noble!\n\nI now enjoy using the Nook which is so much easier and more comfortable to hold than regular books while reading,  and to carry back & forth to work each day or to travel with. I don't like the gray screen which requires you to face the Nook towards the light; and I don't like the glare on the screen from the sun or lights. I have to sit \"just so\" to read it - which somewhat defeats the idea of portability. Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.\n\nMy favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles! Most of my library's digital books are in ePub format which is the native format of the Nook. However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software. Borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire, or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period.\n\nOrdinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once. Additionally, due to the poor customer service from both Amazon (who owns Kindle) and Barnes & Noble (who owns Nook) I am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies, and will primarily download either their free books or the library's loan books. The companies want us to buy their ebooks, but won't take responsibility for their e-readers, so that infuriates me and alienates me for life.\n\nThe pros: the low price; comfort; convenience; savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something you'll only read once; no clutter of physical books; easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in 14 days (automatic returns); ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free Calibre software. The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.\n\nThe cons: PlueProton's and Barnes & Nobles's total lack of responsibility for their defective Nooks - why I gave the Nook such a low rating; Amazon's siding with Blue Proton's irresponsible returns policy; dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting; touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be - often have to touch the screen a few times before getting a response.\n\nOver all I'm pleased with my Nook Simple Touch now that I managed to FIX IT BY MYSELF, but the companies' irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for life.", "summary": "no responsibility from sellers for initially defective  new product", "unixReviewTime": 1361836800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2013", "reviewerID": "A1SJ2GM93KFY0V", "asin": "140053271X", "reviewerName": "leslie eckhardt", "reviewText": "Smart, sleek and easy-to-read, this Nook is my first E-reader and I am very happy with it.

I don't buy something to read these ads. Amazon and B & N are too greedy trying to push stuff on the users as they feel like, at the users expense.\n\nI will try to get a new Android tablet instead (for reading, and Internet browsing).

I have an iPad but when I do read, sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache.  It came down to this, the basic Kindle, and the new Kindle Paperwhite.  When I really thought about it, the Paperwhite was more than I really wanted to spend on something I would only use an hour or 2 a week.  I ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didn't have to be converted to MOBI files which the Kindle uses.\n\nIt wasn't quite as straight forward as I was expecting.  I initially thought it'd be like the iPad where you just drag the book into the Books section of iTunes and you're ready to go.  I dragged the books onto the Nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened.  I found out you had to download ADE and set it up that way.  From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook, not a huge deal, but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.\n\nI also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time, it wasn't the most accurate.  It also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computer(I think the Kindle is the same way as well though).\n\nThe reading experience is great though.  Its not too bright and easy on the eyes.  The Nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile.  Library is also easy to scroll through once its on your device.\n\nOverall I am happy with it.  I mentioned its shortcomings, but they don't outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience.  From a reading standpoint I'd give it 5 stars, just some other things that popped up that aren't big deals, but noticable.

Seriously, I've played with the current e-ink Kindles, and the difference in refresh rate might SEEM small on paper, but in practice it's a very noticeable difference.\n\n- I never had the wifi problems others did after the November firmware update, but I understand that the latest firmware update should solve it.\n\n- The NST feels really nice when you're holding it, and I really like that there are physical page turn buttons in addition to the onscreen touch turning - I use both, depending on whether I'm sitting up or lying down when I read, etc.\n\n- Navigation is very intuitive.\n\n- I bought a $5 4gb micro SD card and have had no problems using it with the NST.\n\n- Sideloading non-DRMed, non-B&N content downloaded from places like Project Gutenburg is very easy, and it all goes into the same library as your B&N downloaded content.\n\nCons:\n\n- The user interface is easy to use, but it's also VERY basic, and there are very few features.

Metadata from sideloaded content doesn't show up, and even purchased content requires you to be on wifi to see more information.\n\nThat's about it.

I might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet, and that won't be from B+N.\n\nHere are the problems with the whole Nook thing.\n\n(1) You can't use it for a PDF, magazine, or anything with graphics because YOU CANNOT ZOOM OR ROTATE. I have purchased some books with pictures and figures that you can't see.  Guess they want you to get the color tablet-like Nook, huh?  Nope, not going there (see above).\n\n(2) YOU CANNOT SHARE BOOKS. Yeah, yeah, they SAY you can, but that's VERY LIMITED and makes no sense.  (If the publishers trust them enough with their DRM to have the book at all, why can't you transfer the book to someone else using the same DRM?) I can get a paperback, read it, and share it forever.  Not so with Nook and you know it.\n\n(3) B+N (and everybody's) E-BOOKS COST THE SAME AS A NEW PAPERBACK, even though the seller didn't incur any cost of printing, shipping, inventory, etc.  But I can get a paperback for 25% off at my local Kroger grocery store for new releases and best sellers, or I can go down to the used book stores and find quite a few titles at 50% (or more) off list.  When everybody in my family has read that book, I can sell it to the used book store for 15% or 25% of list value.  That's a win-win.\n\nSo, where's the advantage with a Nook other than it's cool?

There are many reviews on YouTube and other places that address that point.  The problem with the B&N system is the fact that you must enter a 'default credit card' to be able to use or purchase any books.  If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.  Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.\n\nI tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.  By contrast, with the Kindle system, you simply buy a book through Amazon using any credit card (which does not have to stay active) and send it to an authorized device.  The Nook system, by comparison, is slow, clunky, and a massive security risk.\n\nIf you setup the Nook and do not provide this credit card during setup, no books can be sent to the Nook wirelessly, they must be sync'ed with a cable tethered to a computer.  Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.  Furthermore, it would appear that B&N is entering into a contract with my minor daughter in this regard.  By opting out of this model, you are left with an utterly useless device.\n\nWhy none of the other reviewers elaborate on this is beyond me.  I suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work, however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child, I'd avoid any device related to B&N altogether.\n\nI give them 2 starts for the hardware only but otherwise the device, in this case, is useless.  While you can delete your credit card from B&N, the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card, order, download, sync, unlock, and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device.

I didn't realize that if you buy books from B&N, you can only read them on your Nook, and not on anything else.  So even though you paid for them, those books really aren't your property.  You have no access to them if you don't use their products! Still, I liked the fact that it used ePub, and you had a variety of stores you could buy from and also that libraries have more ePub books available.  However, I just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from B&N. If I had known this I never would have bought the Nook. It's as consumer un-friendly as you can get!  Really a nasty way to do business.  Amazon is different.  Once you buy a book, it is yours.  You can read it on any device. When it comes to buying books, Amazon is far easier to use and alot more consumer friendly.  The Kindle is by far a better choice of the two.\nI am returning the Nook after only a week, because this is a frustrating product that doesn't function like it is supposed to do.  There are simply too many glitches in how the touch screen works to be reliable. Here are the cons:  First, it often takes multiple touches to access anything.  You touch or swipe the screen, and nothing happens.  You try it again, and still nothing.  What a joke.  Second, pages turn mysteriously on their own and without warning, both forward and backward.  I am always losing my place when I try to read a book.  I've noticed that this happens almost every time you alter the angle of the Nook.  If you're reclining and turn to adjust the pillow, don't expect to return back to the same page you were on.  Third, the pop-up menu and dictionary are too easy to activate by accident.  If you hold the Nook too close to the screen, or at the top or bottom, the pop-up menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally.  This happens several times an hour.  You can't just simply sit down, relax and read unless you sit motionless in a chair and hold it on your lap. Last of all, it does not use a standard USB/micro USB cable. The USB connection to the computer is standard, but the micro USB connection to the Nook itself is NOT!  It is thinner and wider.  You can only use the cord provided with the Nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries.  You can't use the standard USB cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets, like your digital camera or your portable hard drive.  So if you need a longer cord, or lose their cord, you're out of luck. Talk about a major inconvenience, one that makes zero sense!

This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire. This device is designed to read books, and it does a beautiful job at it. I purchased my Sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it, but it was way too difficult, and ultimately I decided to purchase an iPad. Like the Sony reader, the nook can take notes but wouldn't be a great device to purchase for that purpose.\nIt was pretty easy to set up- I didn't read the instruction manual, but I usually don't. I just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet, my barnes and noble account, and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books. I had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet, but that has happened with every new device I've purchased, so I think its my internet's fault, not the nook. I went through the steps a few times and then it started worked.\nI really like holding it to read- I generally read ridiculously thick books, so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that I have to prop up (and its so much nicer to read from than an iPad- the iPad is fine to read from, and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue, but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand). Initially I didn't realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back, so I was touching the screen each time- the delay time is a bit longer that way, and it was annoying to have to use both hands. As soon as I realized that the buttons existed, the experience got even better.\nThe battery life seems great- I charged it all the way up using my usb-to-outlet power adapter that I have for my iphone/ipad, and it worked great. I haven't had to charge it again, and I've been reading for about an hour each day.\nThe one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when I realized that I couldn't load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasn't enough room. The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads. A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble. Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that. I popped it in, turned the device off and on, and I was ready to go again. Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.\nKindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources. Yes, its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people won't be interested in. I would have purchased the kindle with special offers, and hadn't thought much about it, but I've enjoyed the pictures of authors that show up on my nook screen, and would probably get annoyed by the commercials/make a point to put my nook in a case so I didn't have to see them.\nDurability- I haven't abused it by any stretch of the imagination- yet- but it did take a fall off a coffee table and didn't crack/break/show any sort of damage\nI'll update my review as I have more time to play with it in the next few months", "summary": "Great purchase- you won't regret it", "unixReviewTime": 1323388800}, {"overall": 1.0, "vote": "67", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2011", "reviewerID": "A36V8NDDRZYRYO", "asin": "140053271X", "reviewerName": "E.

The Franklin eBookman had nice hardware but dreadful firmware with more bugs than you would find in a swamp in summer.  The Ectaco Jetbook Lite had a number of glitches in its firmware as well, plus an extremely user-unfriendly upgrade method.\n\nI did encounter one major problem with this Nook Simple Touch -- the life of a battery charge was nowhere near the several weeks promised (with wifi off).  Fortunately, however, I called B&N Customer Service, and they advised me to install the latest firmware, V1.0.1, which addresses the power issue.\n\nThe upgrade proceeded easily and without glitches, and it seems to have solved the problem; though I haven't put the duration of a battery charge to the full test yet, the charge indicator is holding at 100% after a full day, including more than an hour of reading.  That compares very favorably to the 83% discharge rate I had been experiencing in just three days using the old firmware.  I will report back if the battery problem returns.\n\nOtherwise I prefer the Nook Simple Touch's ergonomics to the comparable Kindle.  The Nook's front is all screen, with no unnecessary keyboard keys.  Virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something.  The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.\n\nThere are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.  You have a choice of font styles and sizes, and the screen is easy to read even under bright sunlight.  You can touch any word onscreen to get a quick dictionary definition (provided, I found, that the word isn't hyphenated and run on two lines).\n\nI like the ease with which you can download titles from the public library (you download to Adobe Digital Reader, which your library provides free, and then transfer the Epub books to your Nook with the USB cable provided).  The program recognized my Nook without any glitches.\n\nI also like being able to read any book for an hour a day FREE at the nearby B&N store.\n\nNewbies should note that, in their apparent effort to keep the NST instructions short and simple, B&N left out a few useful ones.  Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter \"library.\"  To lock the Nook immediately, without waiting for it to enter sleep mode, press the power button on the back briefly.  And to tell when the Nook has finished charging, wait for the little LED next to the USB input on the unit to turn from amber to green.\n\nSo if you have been looking for an ebook reader offering great value and ergonomics, take a look at this Nook.  But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!)\n\nUPDATE: Trust me to find the bugs in an ebook reader -- or perhaps they find me.  At any rate, I bought a copy of the American Heart Association Cookbook (7th Edition) and was dismayed to see some of the fractions describing quantities in recipes replaced by question marks!\n\nI emailed B&N Customer Support, and they suggested that I try downloading the title again (which you do by archiving and unarchiving a title, whatever that means).  That didn't work, but I found that if I clicked the check box on the font selection screen marked \"Publisher's Default\" (or words to that effect), that seemed to solve the problem.

I'm very happy with it so far and my only real complaint is that the B&N accessories are a little on the high side.  I mean really, you're paying 140 bucks for the reader, you shouldn't have to shell out $30 for a case.  Other than that, I think it's really cool and it doesn't have any of the web browser/mp3 nonsense on it that sucks anyway on e readers.

The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf. There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you. The settings page is a joke, there is almost no customization to be had there. The shop's main view was nonfunctional out of the box; every time I tried to access it, it kicked me back out to the main page, and I had to access it by going to the \"top 100\" page instead, and even then the search would sometimes not work.

While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!\n\nNow here comes the Nook Simple Touch Reader (Nook STR). I got one via pre-order when they came out in early June.  It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook STR, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the \"slide to unlock\" feature like the iPhone. The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine. I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.\n\nIn response to the reviews about the touchscreen ceasing to respond, the pre-order Nook STR I had suffered from that problem.  The touchscreen would become slow to respond, and eventually quit working altogether.  A power cycle generally brought it back.  I started a thread on B&N's website about this and found many others having the problem.  I did take my Nook STR back to B&N and they exchanged it.  Have had the replacement Nook ST for six weeks now and the problem hasn't returned.  So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.\n\nGoing back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).  This software allows you to manage your ebooks on your Nook.\n\nThe Nook STR is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills.  Using the device is easy enough, but loading books from a library website (via Adobe Digital Editions) requires a few steps to complete.  If help is needed, it can be a positive relationship-building experience.\n\nOne last plus - once you get your Nook STR, check the \"Shop\" tab to access B&Ns website.

What happened though, was on about the 12th day while using it the touch screen stopped responding.  I couldn't turn a page with the screen or pull up a menu with the screen or do anything else.  And, when I shut it off and turned it back on I couldn't swipe the screen to get into the book - I was completely stuck...locked out.

In the past month alone, I have made at least 12 purchases.  I was browsing around just now and decided to see what Amazon.com customers thought of my newest electronic device.  I was thrilled to see the high rating, but disappointed to see the price; $40.00 more than the thing costs at B/N since its release last month.  Amazon, you need to do better here!\n\nNow to the product - This is my first e-reader and I am certain that I went with the best product for me.  As someone who buys a lot of books from Amazon, I would have preferred to have bought the Kindle,especially since Amazon has more of the types of books I read and for much cheaper than B/N, but I just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device.  I absolutely LOVE my Nook Simple Touch, and I use it for several hours every day.  B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.  My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.\n\nThe touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device, so if you prefer not to use it, they are also tactile \"buttons\" that will allow you to change pages.  The home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on - a few other books in your library, and some suggested readings.  You can create shelves that you name on which to house your books by categories. They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.\n\nWithout going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.  Some people buy this expecting it to browse the web (although it does have a hidden browser that the techies are working to hack) - Play their audio files, when there is not headphone jack (Techies have discovered that it DOES have built-in bluetooth, however), and folks buy this and complain that they do not like how it does not display their magazines in color.  It is not meant to do that - it is meant to be solely an enjoyable easy-to-use reading device that does not give you a whole lot of options to be distracted from the task at hand, READING!\n\nThis is why I bought it - Eventually, I will get a nook color - or a Kindle *color* if they come out with one, but for now, I thoroughly  enjoy my Nook, which has encouraged me to slow down and spend so much more time in the peaceful, leisurely act of reading. In my excitement, I am reading like 8 different books at once.  That is the great joy of having an e-reader - speaking to those who are, just as I used to be, resistant to the e-reading craze - there is no more lugging around a bag filled with books, and when I get tired of reading one, another book is just a couple of swipes away. I am learning about how to get all sorts of books for free or low cost, as well as learning how to take advantage of conversion and e-book management tools such as Calibre.  I am having a blast with this thing!\n\nYesterday, I received a nice leather case for it that I purchased off Ebay for a great price.  Once again, I looked to Amazon.com first, but there simply were not good options.  I got a black leather Caseen case that also came with a screen protector for twenty bucks.", "summary": "Really, Amazon?

That's clearly not what Barnes and Noble designed this unit for.  It's not intended to surf the web, check email, etc.  It is an eReader...PERIOD!\n\nHaving said that, in my opinion, it is the best out there right now.  It is incredibly light weight - much lighter than even a typical paperback.  It is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book.  The clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an LCD type display is after a few hours.\n\nThe battery life is insane.  If you turn off WIFI, which should be normal unless you are looking for another book, the battery doesn't need recharging for weeks on end.  Page turning is a simple touch to the left or right of the screen.  Assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press.  I found most of the time I don't use them.\n\nIt has a very responsive touch screen for all your navigation.  I had a 1st generation Nook and this one is far easier to navigate through books which is a big plus for Bibles or Reference books.  It reads ePub format so more than half of what I read comes from the public library.\n\nIt is not going to be great for color magazines and so on.  You will need a Nook Color or an ePad like Xoom or IPAD for that.  But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.\n\nOne nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.

This is the second update to the Nook since launch.  All I can say is THANK YOU Barnes & Noble!\n\nThe LCD screen improvements alone are GREAT!  With better looking icons, more responsiveness, and a sleeker appearance -- it makes me think of that McDonald's commercial: I'm lovin' it!\n\nSeveral of the well documented issues have been fixed, such as losing bookmarks due to powering off the unit -- which as it turns out was the most cited problem for Nook bashers and haters alike.  Nook haters will also be disappointed that the battery life has been optimized too.\n\nAll-in-all if you've been waiting for the minor 1.0 issues to be fixed prior to purchasing the Nook you will not be disappointed in this newest version.  And if you have been considering switching from the Kindle you would be well advised to do so at this point.\n\n*****************************************************************************\nUpdated 01/31/2010\n*****************************************************************************\n\nThis device is clearly the best option on the market today, with it's LCD touchscreen, Wi-fi, memory expansion capabilities, and so, so much more. Let's \"wade in the weeds\" and look at some of the features in detail:\n\nLCD Touchscreen\n\nSo far this is the only mainstream reader to offer a LCD screen of any kind. The Coverflow-like book cover listing is beautiful, elegant, and functional. With the newest update it is uber fast, intuitive, and responsive. Page turns are super easy with the touchscreen, all you have to do is swipe the screen with one finger when it's in standby mode and the page turns.  In addition, it's easier for me to navigate books via the LCD than textually. Seeing the cover is a really nice feature, since books are designed to pique your interest by the cover. It just seems like a good cover sells a book, and seeing that cover in crisp LCD sells me from time to time.\n\nThe keyboard is nice, any time a text field comes up you will have the keyboard pop up on queue. It's fast, responsive, and best of all doesn't look like a 1970's era fax machine keypad like some of the older readers on the market.\n\nWi-fi\n\nThe built in Wi-fi is one of the great features of this device. Modern 3G speeds are pretty fast, but as most of us know that have smartphones, Wi-fi is about 100 times faster, especially when one tries to download large things, or a lot of content. The Wi-fi on this device is no exception... it's fast and super easy to set up. The on screen instructions are sooo clear to follow. I couldn't imagine only having 3G these days, like when you are in an area that doesn't have 3G coverage, you can still use the Nook over Wi-fi.  This is truly one of the killer features of the Nook.  You can go into a B&N store and Wi-fi to your hearts content, but then come home and do the same.  Hotels offering free Wi-fi are the Nooks biach.\n\nMemory Expansion\n\nThe Nook has a Micro-SD card slot which accepts up to 16GB Micro-SD cards, this allows you to upgrade your memory indefinitely. Another advantage would be to organize your books. And books on the card are never going to get lost if your reader dies -- without having to re-download from the cloud.  Plus with the new B&N desktop reader you can move your books from the Nook to a laptop/netbook on the fly, and what if the worst should happen and your eReader dies?  You still have those books on the card.\n\nAppearance\n\nThis is a biggy for me as it is for most people... I don't tend to buy or use things that look ugly. That's why I've got an iPod instead of a Zune, why I've got a LCD TV instead of a CRT, and now why I've got a Nook instead of another reader. The appearance of this device can be described with one word, SEXY. It just looks good. Other readers currently available range from looking \"not too bad\" to looking downright ugly. This reader is the exception to that rule and employs a host of features to boot.\n\nBook formats and availability\n\nThis is probably the biggest of all the features, since we are talking about a book reader, the Nook boasts a whopping 1,000,000 books available for it, in readily readable format, from just two sources (B&N and Google). The nearest competitor only offers 500,000 books in it's native format (Kindle). You can convert many books to a Kindle readable format, but it's a hassle and you have to use your computer to do that. Sort of defeats the purpose of the wireless if you have to constantly connect to the PC. And there are third party sources for books in Kindle format, probably websites you've never heard of, new sites pop up all the time since Kindle has a big install base, but the quality of books on those sites is in question compared to a reputable company like Google.\n\neInk display\n\nIt seems to be crisper than much of the competition out there. The ability to change the typeface and size of the fonts is wonderful. The nearest competitors screen almost seems fuzzy in comparison, which for me makes it harder to read. Page changes are fast on the Nook, while nothing can compare with the speed of changing a real books' page, it's fast enough for the average person. Speed readers may find themselves waiting for a few milliseconds though. The controls on the Nook are straightforward and intuitive.\n\nReplacable battery\n\nThis is another biggy for most ebook people, with the Nook you can change the battery out should you A) want extended reading times without charge, or B) if the original battery dies for some reason.  Many of the other readers on the market do not allow this, which means they are bricked if the battery dies and will either have to be repaired or replaced.\n\nBattery life\n\nA lot has been said about the battery life of the Nook, and other eReaders.  All of the manufacturers of these devices overstate the real world battery life in real world useage situations.  I have a co-worker with one of the Amazon (Kindle Brand) eReaders and he has to charge every 3 - 4 days.  Nook lasts for me about 5 - 7 days, but it all depends on what features you use on either or any of the devices and how much you use them to determine actual, real world battery usage. Either way, all of these devices are easy to charge.  Just plug into a standard 110 - 120 outlet and PRESTO!  Or in the case of the Nook, you can also plug into your computer/laptop/netbook and VOILA!  You will be on go in no time flat.\n\nEase of use\n\nThe Nook is easy to set up and use, The onscreen keyboard is more familiar and similar to modern devices than many of the competitors setups.\n\nSummary\n\nThere are so many features of this device it's hard to capture them all in one review. All in all this is one great device, with it's iPod like look and feel, large number of built in features, and industry standard operating system, it's clearly the choice of discerning electronics customers.\n\n*******************************\nUpdate\n*******************************\n\nSo, I had been told on these comments that the B&N in store functionality was not ready to be used yet -- another lie dispelled today.  I stopped in at the B&N in Hillsboro and it is in fact fully functional.  My Nook immediately recognized the B&N network and connected without me even having to tell it to!  As it turns out there is exclusive content at each B&N store, at this particular one there were multiple books that could be downloaded for FREE!!!  So, seeing one that piqued my interest I naturally downloaded it.  Wow, super fast and convenient, and FREE!", "summary": "Nook eReader", "unixReviewTime": 1262044800}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "26", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2009", "reviewerID": "AOKC4MRKH1UON", "asin": "1400599997", "reviewerName": "Phil", "reviewText": "The Nook is the best e-reader yet. It replaces the keyboard on the Kindle with a color touch screen about the size of the iPhone display. This makes it easy to maneuver between  the store, your library, your current book, the daily (with messages, newsletters, and other free content), and settings. The LCD display changes from menu items to images of book covers to a keyboard as needed, and then turns off when reading.\n\nYou can connect by both WiFI and free 3G to download a purchase in seconds, and connect with WiFi to get content and other offers when you walk into a B&N store. I'm using the latest 1.1.1 SW release that fixes most of the issues noted in early reviews. Updates are done automatically over the air.\n\nThe nook feels great in the hand with a slightly contoured back that adds a little thickness for the hand to grip. Controls are provided for equal usability by a left or right-hander person. The back is removable and replaceable with different colors. They are all rubber coated to make it less likely to drop. Unlike the Kindle the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable. The e-ink display is the same type, but appears to be slightly crisper than the Kindle 2. The nook supports  EPUB (Non or Adobe DRM), PDB (Non DRM), PDF, Graphics: JPG, GIF, PNG, BMP, Audio: MP3, PDB. The online B&N bookstore has about a million books compared to the Kindle store with half that, the major difference being the free public domain books provided by Google.\n\nSummary:\nWhile it costs the same as the Kindle, the nook is loaded with extra features: WiFi, color LCD, removable battery, expandable memory, more open book formats.

I've gotten used to hierarchical folders-within-folders. It has one level of folders, but still has a largely flat organization. That gets clunky after you load a few dozen books. I'm not nuts about the iffy touchscreen features, either - big fingers and small UIs don't match. I've used only the basic reading and library features, so can't comment on the rest.\n\nWhat needs work: I can load and store books via USB.

Initially, I liked it, but I quickly learned that the battery life wasn't nearly the quoted time (it lasts about 2 days for me, 3 max with wireless off and the most power-saving settings). The e-ink/lcd screen mix was nice for navigation, although I understand that the newer touch models will be more battery-efficient.

My original nook had a two-part screen, this new nook had a one-part screen and its' buttons squeaked when pressed. Little did I know at the time that this was the sign of a very important defect! As it happened, this 'squeaking', which made the buttons difficult to press, also caused the page-turn buttons to crack just one month past warranty. Needless to say, I wasn't delighted. Apparently, the page-turn buttons cracking is a very common defect. So if you buy a nook, remember this: if the button squeaks and is hard to press, it will break. Return it while you can. Not all the nooks are like this (my old one wasn't), so I recommend checking it out.\n\nOverall - 3/5 - it's a solid reading device but doesn't really compare to the new-generation nook simple touch/kindle touch devices or even the Kindle 3 keyboard (which I now also own).", "summary": "Nice device but battery and Customer Service problems", "unixReviewTime": 1322352000}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "5", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2011", "reviewerID": "A1DV3TKP3YXO7O", "asin": "1400599997", "reviewerName": "Christopher B", "reviewText": "I have always been a fairly skeptical critic of e-readers.  When I first heard of the Kindle, I thought the idea was pretty absurd, to need an electronic device that mimics something as universally understood as a book.  However, as I grew older and grew more cynical that I will probably never get my 10+ books I've lent out over the years back, the idea of an e-reader started to sound more desirable.  Enter the Nook.\n\nI've read a lot of bad press on this little guy.  Most of the bad press seemed to stem from consumer reviews, which I honestly take to heart more-so than professional critics.  Here is a list of things I've noticed people don't seem entirely too fond of regarding the Nook, and my experience with these 'negative' aspects.\n\n- Battery Life.  Although shorter than some e-readers (but not at ALL as short as the Nook color or any tablets you may purchase/already have) I haven't yet felt constricted or nervous that my battery will deplete midway through a book.  I would think that considering the era we're in of constantly recharging our phones (I have to recharge my Droid Incredible nearly every 8 hours after moderate usage) we would be a little more forgiving if the Nook only lasts a mere week.  I don't mind recharging it once/twice a week while I sleep... I don't think anyone should to be honest, but that's just me.\n\n- LCD touch screen. This is one of those gripes I find somewhat warranted.  This is definitely the reason for the shorter battery life (set it to sleep after 10 or 30 seconds, and brightness to about 15%) but my biggest gripe is that it can be unresponsive at times.  I never once, however, found the navigation to be clunky or as unresponsive as some people claim... but I think these gripes found in earlier reviews has been remedied through a major update to the Nook firmware.  Yay!  I found the navigation to be highly intuitive and the built in dictionary highly helpful.\n\nI love this thing.  I love being able to read Barnes & Noble classics for free, checking e-books out from the library, and the prospect of sharing books with others who own a Nook.

With my library card I can download epub books and check them out, anywhere I've got internet.  I don't have to check them back in, they just go away after the check out period.  Same with Audiobooks.  Nook handles this format, other eReaders do not, so you might want to look into this option and what formats the readers have before making a decision.\n\nI like the onscreen keyboard/touch screen, personally.  It is bright and easy in areas where dimly lit and the light in your reader case is directed at the reading screen.  Seems like no big deal, but after 28 hours on a plane you get tired and this makes a difference.\n\nNot a bunch of keys to hit/press with the keyboard exposed.  This is a personal opinion, and I can absolutely understand why others may want the keyboard.  I put in pagemarks etc on books, but don't type a lot of notes into the ebooks when reading.  If you do a lot of this, you may want to test run the onscreen keyboard and see if you like it.  I don't, the amount of typing is very limited, so onscreen is perfect and I'm used to it with my phones.\n\nUsing this over wifi to surf the internet is something you can do, but it isn't the best.

The one and only reason I chose Nook (instead of just sticking with and upgrading my beloved old Kindle 1) is its ability to download books from the public library. Tomorrow I am taking the Nook back to Best Buy for a refund, not an exchange. The Nook is attractive and nicely packaged. I completely expected it to just work, like my Kindle did (and still does) and all of my Apple products do. But, like so many other reviewers here, my Nook never even got up and running before it croaked. First, it would not complete the registration process. I have an active account on B&N and strong WiFi in my home, plus this Nook also has 3G so there were not any connection problems. Then, when I decided to just register later and moved on to explore how the Nook worked, it froze. Could not reboot or turn it off by holding down power key as suggested in the troubleshooting help/support on the B&N website. It did not work. I do not want to mess with taking the back off, using little screwdrivers or whatever to take out (the fully charged) battery, etc. We should not have to do that on a brand new 200.00 product! So, am taking it back and won't buy another until they improve the quality of the thing. I never had one bit of trouble with my trusty Kindle, and would not even be looking at another brand of reader except for Kindle's inability to download library books.  I'm giving the Nook two stars instead of one because, if it actually worked, it looks like it would be a nice ereader and it has a more open format than Kindle does.\n\nUpdate: 1/28/11\n\nWent to return the Nook for a refund today and at the last minute decided to give it another go, so did exchange instead. Tonight charged and powered up the replacement Nook, so far so good. It works perfectly. Registration was smooth and fast, wifi connected easily with my signal, downloaded a book quickly, and navigation is a breeze.  No problems encountered yet except that it is not downloading an available firmware update, and there's probably some explanation for that so not a big deal.  So, I might just end up keeping this baby as a companion to my Kindle. Love having the Nook with its open format for library and other downloads. Will see how it holds up over the next several weeks and then update my rating accordingly.\n\nUpdate: 2/3/11\n\nReturned the Nook to Best Buy today and bought a Kindle 3 through Amazon. After exchanging the first defective Nook then using its replacement for several days I found that the device worked pretty much as it was supposed to. There are a couple of minor things about it that I was not crazy about and probably would have gotten used to, but there is one problem (design flaw?) that for me is definitely a deal killer. One of the minor annoyances is that there is a lot of screen flash during any menu change. Another is that the color, lighted touch screen control at the bottom of the device is distracting when it lights up at any touch during reading. And after a while I was not that crazy about the menu navigation either, seemed like too many steps and screen flashes, but probably could have gotten used to that too. I would not have rejected the Nook just over those little quirks. The big reason that the Nook was no way going to work out for me is, again, that touch screen display at the bottom of the device. It is, like an iPad, highly reflective. So what that means is that when the screen is off, which it is most all of the time during reading, you can watch yourself read! The black screen reflects anything in front of it, almost like a dark mirror. That was a no go for me, no I did not like it at all. Aside from these annoyances, the Nook did well at everything it was designed to do. So will upgrade the rating to reflect (haha) that. I have to say that I am much happier with the Kindle, but Amazon really needs to get with the program and let Kindle use the epub format. They will eventually lose me and a lot of other prospective customers over the epub problem, it is that big of a deal.\n\nYet another update! 5/31/11\n\nCaved in and purchased another Nook last week. I still love my Kindle and prefer it over Nook, but just could not wait another minute for Amazon to open Kindle to ePub for downloading public library books. So, last week when B&N had Nooks for sale cheap on their eBay website (99.00, free ship, 3g/wifi, non-color, refurb w/ full warranty) I jumped on it. This refurb Nook worked much better out of the box than my initial brand new device purchased then returned back in Jan/Feb. I am using the Nook just for library books, and it does what it's supposed to do. Navigation works well, but seems like it requires more step than Kindle. Still do not like the reflective color screen below the reading area. There is one thing that I do like better on Nook, the screen background is a paler gray than Kindle making for easier reading in low light.

I went back and forth between Amazon's Kindle and B&N's NOOK.  The thing that sold me on the NOOK was the ability to download books from other sources than just Amazon.  I can download books from my local library, Google Books, along with Barnes & Noble's selection of over 2 million books they offer.  The ability to download any ePub and PDF files is a plus.  I like the touch pad vs. keyboard on Kindle.  It took a little getting used to as it is very touch sensitive, but once I got the hang of it, it is a smooth way to navigate.  One of the criticisms of NOOK has been some sluggishness with the NOOK, which I have maybe a tiny bit of, but we're talking maybe a second or so, so it is no big deal really.  There have been many criticisms about the battery life of the NOOK, but to me it's a minor thing as all I have to do is plug it in about every 4 or 5 days if I use my NOOK excessively.  It lasts longer if the WiFi is turned off.  I can go a week without having to recharge it then.  I also like the ability to replace the battery myself rather than having to send the the entire Kindle in to have it replaced.  One of the nicest features of the NOOK is being able to go into my local B&N bookstore and talking to a real live person if I have any questions or have any problem with my NOOK.  B&N has NOOK stations right in their stores with people who are there to answer questions or help with problems you may encounter.  They are very helpful.

I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.\nThen the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...\n\nWell The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.\n\nRight out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.\n\nI also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...\n\nNow with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!\n\nI have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.\n\nNow with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews.

L. Green", "reviewText": "I am still waiting for the perfect ebook reader. I bought the Nook for these reasons: 1) It reads industry-standard ePub-format ebooks, 2) it's tightly integrated with the B&N ebook store, 3) the ebooks are encrypted in a well-documented easily-understood format that is portable across multiple devices so they can be decrypted and read in, say, your iPad's Nook reader software, or even in a Sony Reader (with the very latest firmware), without having to be re-purchased because of DRM nonsense.\n\nThe problem is that the Nook simply doesn't live up to its promise. The \"paper-white\" display is more an off-beige, and reflects light in a way that makes it hard to read with a reading light (necessary because it has no backlight, as is true for all ePaper devices). It's heavy and the buttons to change pages are hard to push, especially with gloved hands as you might have while reading outdoors on a cool day. The \"5 day battery life\" in reality for me has been a 1-day battery life, read a book, and it needs to be recharged, and be darn sure to turn it off. The thing freezes up and crashes all the time even with the very latest software, and is excruciatingly slow even with the very latest software. The latest software added classifications for the ebooks so you could sort them into pseudo-folders, which is necessary given how excruciatingly slow the Nook is to scroll through its book list (get about 50 books on the list and you're in for major pain), but the clunky way they implemented this makes those of us who've gotten used to modern user interfaces frown and shake our heads.\n\nSad to say, I really can't recommend any current eBook reader. Either they're too clumsy to use (Nook), have no books available for them (Sony), or have a proprietary eBook format that locks you into a single vendor (Kindle). I'm seriously considering buying an iPad, yes, it will only work for 9 hours or so on a battery charge, but that's true of the Nook too in real actual use and the iPad is usable for a lot of other things too. It's just disappointing that I can't get an ePaper-based reader that meets my criteria (non-proprietary ebook format, long battery life, compact, decent user interface), and instead have things either crippled by bad design decisions or crippled by having a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor.

I actually waited until the Nook Color was announced before opening the box - I wanted to see what the new gadget had to offer and if it'd be worth trading mine in.\n\nThere were some rumors that the Nook Color would feature a screen with Mirasol technology, and I was disappointed to learn that it actually had an LCD screen coated with something to reduce glare. I state at an LCD screen all day at work, and don't want to do the same while reading. Plus, I'm not sure how well the LCD screen would fare in the sun and I'm interested to hear feedback from Nook Color owners.\n\nI think the color screen matters if you want to read a lot of magazines, or textbooks, or kids' books, none of which I'll be doing. Nook Color also stores more books (6000) and allows the reader to send updates to Facebook and Twitter directly from the eReader. Personally, I didn't find any of these extra features particularly appealing, so I'm happily sticking with the original Nook.\n\nMy Observations/Pros of the Nook\n\n-It's bigger than I expected, in a good way. It's not heavy, but has a nice \"significant\" feel to it.\n-I think few people realize how clear and book-like the e-Ink screen actually is. I showed the Nook to some friends, and that was the first thing they noticed.\n-The bottom LCD touch-screen adds a little oomph with the color buttons and book covers.\n-Getting ePub books from the public library has been surprisingly easy, although you have to connect the Nook to a computer in order to transfer the ePub files.\n-I've been enjoying the Nook Facebook group where administrators post a free eBook every Friday.\n-The instructional videos online are very helpful in getting started with the Nook.\n\nCons\n\n-BN.com has a Free NookBooks section, but for some reason, not all the free eBooks are listed. I saw some Kindle titles that were available for free, and when I searched on BN.com, turns out they were free there as well.\n-I didn't care much about the LendMe feature of the Nook, but it was still disappointing to learn that not all purchased eBooks can be lent out. Publishers control which titles can be used for lending, and each book can only be lent out once....ever.\n-The PDF manual for the Nook is very confusing and can benefit from some serious editing.\n-There are definitely more Kindle books than NookBooks available, but I hope that will change in the near future.\n\nAll in all, I am pretty happy with the Nook and I think the fact that it supports a wider range of eBook formats outweighs many of the cons.

Salinger, Holistic Nurse Practitioner", "reviewText": "There are a multitude of reviews that compare and contrast the Nook and Kindle, so I'm not going to go into a full-blown comparison and review. I'm going to focus on my experience owning both, most specifically battery life and availability of books.\n\nMy husband uses the kindle and I use the Nook. The reason I went with the Nook is because initially I was very \"anti\" non-paper book. He wanted a kindle and I sneered at the idea. I was being a book snob and didn't like the idea of books in electronic format, so I snubbed my nose at it.\n\nHowever, after we took a vacation and he had his kindle loaded with books, and I had 8-10 big paper books, I began to reconsider my position.  Upon return from our vacation I elected to get a Nook. I did so because I liked the idea of the touch screen at the bottom rather than the keyboard, which I thought made the kindle look klunky. I thought overall that the Nook was more aesthetically pleasing. So - I ordered the nook.\n\nThere are two major things that the kindle has on the Nook, and that is far superior battery life, and significantly more books available for download - especially so if you read non-fiction.\n\nThe battery life on my Nook is awful. So much so that I ordered a new battery thinking perhaps I had a dud. Nope - it's performance is just the same. If I am actively reading a book I have to recharge  every 3 days. If I don't read it for 10-14 days it will drain on it's own. Comparing this to my husband's kindle, he can go an entire 2 week trip reading books daily without having to recharge his kindle! It takes a couple months to drain with no usage. The kindle's battery life is mega-much more than my Nook. I have serious battery life envy. For that alone I've begun to covet his kindle.\n\nThe second bummer is that most of the available books for Nook are fiction. There are some of the more popular non-fiction type books available. Usually whatever is most trendy at the time, but for the most part any professional type texts, or anything not on a best seller list that is non-fiction can't be found for the Nook platform. However, when I go to Amazon, 8 of 10 times, I'll find it available for download on the kindle.\n\nBUT! One thing about this is that for me, I tend to mark up and highlight my non-fiction books a lot because I'm using them for reference sources. It is very difficult to quickly retrieve highlighted text from the electronic source compared to my real, paper books. So I've actually come to realize that I'd likely be purchasing my non-fiction as real paper books anyways, so that I can have them for ready reference and mark them up with my highlights and little flags (yes - I'm a geek who uses the little flag tabs to mark pages in my books!) So, I'm now fine with the fact that I can't readily download non-fiction to my Nook and instead I continue to buy them as regular, paper books. As I said above, I'd likely buy my non-fiction as real books anyways since I use them as references.\n\nI now download all my fiction books to the Nook. So it's become my source for pleasure reading, which is great, since that is the kind of stuff I take with me when I travel or about town anyways, and can just stuff the Nook in my purse.\n\nHowever, I VERY MUCH ENVY THE BATTERY LIFE OF THE KINDLE! If I could stuff a kindle battery into my Nook I'd be a super happy girl.\n\nIf I had it to do over I'd likely buy a kindle for myself despite it's less aesthetically pleasing appearance.

They give you 7 pages...but it's the cover, copyright, dedication page with only a paragraph of the actual story. Not enough to make me want to buy a book. The closest B&N is 1 hour drive away so I couldn't take advantage of the cafe freebies or free reading in-store.\n\nAfter I discovered that I cannot organize books into folders, that was the final straw. I read novels with racy titles, my 10 y.o. son wanted to read his classics on the nook but I didn't want to lend it to him because he would see all my books & potentially read them. This is a biggie for me so lost another *.\n\nFeatures I'm happy with: I was able to check-out books from my library & I was able to put my pdf books on the nook. Yey! Unfortunately, my library just got into ebooks & have only a handfull of books so it'll be a while until I can fully take advantage of this feature.\n\nWell, these are my personal experiences with which I now realize that I didn't do a thorough reasearch as I first thought, LOL. My fault...but I still like my nook, though I'm no longer in love with it like when I first received it. I've also ordered the latest Kindle so we'll see which one I'll keep - I'm looking forward to the push-button keys on that, LOL.", "summary": "Drains battery so fast", "unixReviewTime": 1283385600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "3", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2010", "reviewerID": "A127X09WZNT908", "asin": "1400599997", "reviewerName": "Deliliah J.

While I couldn't get my hands on a Kindle 3 to evaluate, I was familiar with the older Kindle 2 and how it feels/operates.  The other two current eReaders I could evaluate locally and run through their paces.\n\nThe Sony reader was a nice size/weight and simple to use.  Unfortunately, the screen was hazy, due to the touch screen features being integrating into the reading screen.  The whole point of e-Ink is to give the best display for reading books.  A hazy screen failed that immediately.  Credit goes to the Sony for allowing me to read DRM ePub books from my local library; a big plus.  If there were no other reasonably priced eReaders that could do that, the Sony still might have had some consideration.  For the price, the Nook below had the same features and much more to offer.  Three years ago this might have been it; but not now.\n\nThe Kindle 3, from everything I read, was a vast improvement over the Kindle 2.  Not that the K2 was bad, but the K3 just made it all the more better.  Without relisting all the pluses of the K3, I'll just jump to what ruled the K3 out:  No DRM ePub support for my local library.  I want to expound on why this really is important!  At first, I added five books to my queue from Amazon that really interested me.  They were priced reasonably; and had I bought the K3, they would have been purchased too.  Next, I went to [...] and logged in with my library book card.  [...] had three of those eBooks available for free check-out from my library.  Had I bought the K3, none of those local library eBooks could have been checked out because the Kindle is NOT supported by local libraries using DRM ePub.  I'm not talking about all those \"free\" eBook web sites that let you download classics from 100 years ago. I'm talking about recently released eBooks that can be checked out from your local library for free; my library uses [...] for this service.  DRM ePub books are licensed/restricted for checkout and can't be converted to a Kindle.  As far as the remaining two books that weren't available from the local library for eBook checkout, I priced them between Amazon vs Barnes and Noble.  The B&N eBooks were cheaper, BUT...in all fairness, I've seen it go the other way with other eBooks that where cheaper at Amazon.  In this case, it was in favor of B&N.  Final point against all versions of Kindle:  The mechanical keyboard hanging off the bottom.  While not distracting from reading books, and somewhat useful for the rare task outside of reading eBooks, it gives them the look of an oversized calculator and not an electronic book.  Of course, this is purely aesthetic; and to some isn't an issue.  When compared to a Nook, it does stands out.\n\nBecause of the harsh Nook reviews on the buggy software, lock-ups, and sluggish performance listed in the early releases of the Nook software, I went ahead and read the online manual to learn all the advanced features of the Nook.  I wanted to walk into B&N and just drill the dickins out of the Nook to see if it could perform; giving it no mercy. Upon walking into the store, I grabbed the first Nook reader I could find.  At first blush, the Nook had an excellent size/weight to me.  It was more rounded than the Sony and the shape fit my hands nicely. Then, I proceeded to use the color touch screen controller and work every feature.  The touch screen responded without a hitch and I found it easy to dive into every function of the Nook.  I selected various eBooks, which took about 5-15 seconds each to load up.  The page turn buttons seemed a little stiff at first, but I had been concerned that these same buttons might get accidentally pushed while holding the Nook.  That wasn't going to happen, so a little stiffness on the buttons was welcome.  The page turns seemed fast.  About two seconds at most to display the next page. The text was very clear with e-Ink at any angle. It was also easy to change the font to other sizes. One thing I found was the dictionary being slightly difficult to access. You have to scroll the feature-list down in the color touch screen first, pick the dictionary choice, and then you can go high-light a word to look up.  Of course, the scroll-list stays where you last left it, so future dictionary lookups are quicker.  I went through all the other features and found nothing surprising or limiting.  No lock-ups, no slowness, etc...  It just worked.  The firmware version was 1.4 on this Nook.  At the time of this review, I believe it is the latest version.  Everything seemed solid; software and hardware.  I bought it (WiFi only model).\n\nAt home, I setup the Wi-Fi access to my home network.  I had to type in the encryption password using the keyboard feature on the color touch display. It is trickier than using a mechanical keyboard.  Yet, I'm a fairly large guy with big fingers and had little problem typing in the information.  I missed some keys now and then, but was able to quickly use the backup key and correct.  A light finger touch is all that is needed to use this keyboard!  Nook registration with B&N was simple and uneventful.  Now, the critical feature:  DRM ePub support using [...] to access my local library eBooks.  After launching Adobe Digital Editions(ADE) eBook reader on my computer, it presented the eBooks I had already checked out from the library.  Next, I connected the Nook via USB to my computer and ADE and registered it as a new device.  At that point, I dragged my eBooks over to the Nook icon in ADE and the eBooks appeared on my Nook, ready to read.  That was simple !\n\nFrom there, I started reading my eBooks. The Nook device faded into the background, as a good eReader should; never in the way of enjoying my eBook.", "summary": "Nook, Sony, or Kindle", "unixReviewTime": 1281657600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "227", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2010", "reviewerID": "A1DQHS7MOVYYYA", "asin": "1400599997", "reviewerName": "H.F.", "reviewText": "MORE UPDATES at the bottom of my review!\n\nMy review includes details of Kindle 3, the newest version! With the time period, I could still return my nook, but I'm still completely in love with it and don't want the kindle for the reasons below.\n\nI was one of those people who was averse to the idea of an e-reader for a long time. I liked the feel of a real book, I was in love with free books at the library, why would I start paying for them? Then, my library got \"overdrive\", which is e-books FREE from the library. Then one day soon after, I woke up and the urge for an e-reader was there. The Nook was my final choice. It took a lot of back and forth and research to get to this point. I bought and tried the Sony Touch reader, returned it, and went and got the Nook. I really honestly wanted the Kindle most, because I'm a loyalist. I love Amazon and felt really comfortable here if I decided to actually start purchasing books again. But below, I'll give you comparisons to the three big readers and the reasons I got the nook:\n- Nook(N) by barnes & noble\n- Kindle 3(K) by amazon.com\n- Sony Reader Touch(ST)\n1. My biggest decision maker was Epub. This is the format in which you can take ebooks out of the library, so I needed whatever I got to be Epub friendly.\n\nN: The Nook is epub friendly. As well as PDF, and many other formats.\nK: The Kindle won't use Epub, which was all I needed to know. It mainly uses it's own Amazon format,while it also uses PDF, mobi and a few others. It makes me feel like Amazon is being greedy, wanting us to only use and buy books from the amazon site. Don't they understand that I love my library?\nST: Sony reader is Epub friendly. pretty much the same as the nook.\n\n2. PRICE!\n\nN: 149 with wifi\nST: 169 NO WIFI\nK: 139 with wifi(or 189 with wifi and free 3G)\n\nWhile kindle 3 is 10 dollars cheaper, it doesn't give me those free library books, so it really doesn't make any difference to me.\n\n*You can now lend some books from the Nook for 14 days to a friend with their new \"lend me\" technology. While this is in beta stages, and not ALL books are lendable. It depends on the agreement with the publisher. The other two you cannot lend at all.\n\n*The Nook has a replaceable, rechargable battery. So it'll last awhile, but when its dwindling, you can spend 30 bucks and put a new one in yourself. For the Kindles, they are sealed inside. People have said you can do it yourself, but you must be tech savvy. Or you can send it away to Amazon for about the cost of [...]+shipping charges and they'll replace it for you.\n\n*You can expand your memory on the Nook and on the Sony touch. The Kindle you cannot, though the Kindle will hold 3,500 books, don't know if you need more space then that?!\n\n*Nook has a fancy color touch screen at the bottom. While the Sony touch has a touch screen(the entire screen), it was slow to respond, very klunky and not very pretty. The kindle is loaded with buttons along the outside of the screen.\n\n* all three have a built in dictionary, which I think is just awesome.\n\n*The new kindle now meets with the nook on their slim width. People used to say the nook was more comfortable to hold because of the width, now the kindle will be as well.\n\n*Yet, the Nook is heavier by about 3 oz then the Kindle or Sony.\n\n*The Nook battery life lasts about 10 days with wifi off, the Sony has 14 days, and the new kindle is up to a month with wifi off(3 weeks with it on)This wasn't a big deal to me, and I was more interested in the other features the Nook DID have, like replaceable battery and expandable memory.\n\n*And you may be wondering, why did I purchase a Sony Touch, and then scamper back hours later to return it? Well. When I got it out of the box, it wasn't techy enough for me. It felt like a very basic, bare bones E-reader. And I already had in my head all the things you hear about the nook: books more expensive, and for some reason I thought it wasn't epub friendly. But the moment I had that Sony in my hand, I went to look at the nook more indepth online. The Sony online library was nothing in comparison to Kindle's Amazon.com or Nook's Barnes & Noble. One of my favorite reads recently was The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It was nowhere to be found on Sony. That gave me a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n*In the past people have complained that Barnes & Noble is significantly more expensive then Amazon. I did some price comparisons of big titles, and found them most of the time to be exactly the same. I think Barnes & Noble might be trying to keep in line with Amazon to draw more readers(Like ME!) into getting the Nook.\n\nOn the whole, the nook is everything I wanted. I've downloaded some free classics from google books, I've taken out library ebooks and it was REALLY easy! I even bought my first book(well, ebook) in a long time. Despite being a new release, it was under ten bucks. I also bought another book I've been meaning to read for years for under four dollars. The nook is comfortable to hold with one hand. I like the using the touch screen to \"swipe\" and turn pages. And tops on my list, I didn't feel horrificly guilty for buying it. One fifty is a reasonable price for such a fun new book reader.\n\nUpdate Oct '10: A software update is coming in Nov:\"dramatically increase page turn speed, customized B&N Library organization and password protection. It also includes the ability to sync across all NOOK and all devices enabled with our free NOOK apps, by syncing your last page read. If you forget your NOOK at home, use the NOOK app for iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, Android smartphone or PC to pick up where you left off. And, the next time you pick up your NOOK, the Reading Now page will be updated and ready to go.\n\nUpdate Dec '10: The update was a pinch to install, and it has some stellar perks that make the nook even more loveable. The shelving option it a lot of fun for those people who like to organize. You can name a shelf anything you want. The only limit is your Barnes and Noble book will stay in their Barnes folder, while any other books you have will stay in My Documents. The page turn is very fast. I do read across multiple devices, but for most people that will be a great new feature.", "summary": "Comparison: Nook vs. Kindle 3 vs. Sony Touch from a library book lover", "unixReviewTime": 1279584000}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "6", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2010", "reviewerID": "A2ONI4Q1SMYOOH", "asin": "1400599997", "reviewerName": "chaos junkie", "reviewText": "So after reading numerous upon numerous reviews about kindle vs nook....I took the dive and got the Nook...I could not be happier.

I bought the device with 3G simply because it was only a little more, and I travel a lot and don't have house wi-fi. I remember when I used to scoff at the nook when walking into B&N and can't believe I ever did that! I love the feel of being able to go into the bookstore, with my nook and feel connected to the actual store. I will admit you have to do your research (read forums, articles etc...) because the nook demo employees, are not going to know everything. Also you MUST read the 'manual' and follow it to a 'T' Don't take the reader out of the box and drain what little battery you have left because you're going to have battery issues (needing it to drain completely a few times and then fully charging it before the battery is at full capacity)\n\nA lot of people may think their nook is 'frozen' when actually the battery is drained, and when that happens the screen is set to whatever screen saver, book page etc you were on when it died. There's no 'power-down' it will just stop, and touchscreen will not be active, once you plug it up and charge it a little, it will be good again. Also the constant use of the touchscreen will drain the unit faster (obvious unfortunate fact)\n\nThere are a lot of books available at the moment (depending what genre you read) especially for teen and sci-fi and fiction (my books), and I was surprised to see all of the 'lend me features' for a good portion of the books I was interested in. Also B&N really listens to complaints and proves that with upgrades (faster page turning, less freezing etc.)Also even when there was a manufacturing error, they were quick to send out a new improved nook. Overall, I love this device, it's fun, its sleek with a solid feel, and it's open-ended for future updates.\n\nIt may be for you, it may not.

I think that both the Nook and Kindle are good products, but the Nook offers the user some unique advantages over its counterpart--the Kindle. First, a buyer can actually test drive the Nook before purchasing it at either Best Buy or at a Barnes and Noble store. The Kindle is only available on line at Amazon.com.  I cannot invest my hard earned money into buying an electronic device without trying it out first. The physical design of the Nook is attractive, sturdy, and compact. Navigating is easy. The user does not have to use the left/right arrows on the Nook to turn the page of an ebook.  The pages of a book can be easily turned by simply swiping the touch screen. Bookmarks can also be set. This is an important feature for me since I tend to read more than one book at a time. Secondly, the Nook offers web browsing.  I was able to link my Nook to my home wireless network and surf web pages.  Although the software is still in its beta stages, I am impressed at what I can already do.  Next, I can download and/or design wallpapers and screensavers for the Nook. This might be a minor point, but it makes the Nook unique and customizable for its owner. The Nook's storage capacity can be expanded. The Nook comes with 2GB of storage that the user can expand up to 16GB by purchasing and installing a micro SD card. The Nook's internal battery lasts about five years with normal use (this is according to technical reviewers), and a replacement battery can be purchased and installed by the user. Nook users also have a community forum they can join on the Barnes and Noble website to share ideas, tips, and news about the Nook.

Why?...\n\n1) It's design is future-proof (as far as anything is) because the hardware is designed such that software and firmware updates can make it more functional in the future.  Kindle requires new hardware. I just read a new one will be out in August '10, and no, no touch screen!\n\n2) Amazon (Kindle) is not a dedicated book store whose sole livelihood is books, like B&N (nook).  Amazon has demonstrated this with its wrangling with publishers to the dismay of both the publishers and Amazon's customers\n\n3) Yes, the nook was rushed out last year but they are now already on V1.3 software, but it works well and has added features and corrected some early flaws.  The page turns are now quicker and very acceptable, especially compared with a real book page turn.  Whoever you are with, they will have some problems and features you do or don't like.  There are supposedly more books via B&N, but never the books you actually want to read - Kindle has some missing for me as well as B&N.\nB&N will no doubt keep updating its software regularly and Amazon make you pay for new Kindles (and risk you not being able to read your e-books on the next version, like V1 to V2)\nE-book pricing is a little crazy right now as publishers seem to be trying to establish the \"value\" of e-books versus paperback/hardcover.  Some e-books are more expensive and some are changing prices weekly.  It's the same situation with both Kindle and nook from what I can tell.\n\n4) The touch screen is a nice feature (future-proofed hardware), but big fingers can hit the wrong selection occasionally.  It is comparable with the iTouch touchscreen performance IMHO.  Navigation is maybe more hassle than the Kindle as a result.  This also makes the nook smaller (no physical keyboard to worry about) and easier to hold, even though it is marginally heavier than the Kindle.\n\n5) The nook can be personalized with your own photos for wallpaper and screen-savers (wrong wording as it's just a picture for when the nook is in sleep mode - No burn-in with e-ink screens). You can add more storage in a nook with a micro SD card\n\n6) The Kindle battery lasts longer, but the nook is fine with the Wi-Fi turned off - about 10 hours.  The nook battery is user-replaceable and costs just $29, unlike the Kindle\n\n7) The nook extended warranty covers ANY accidental breakage/spillage for the full 2 years.\n\n8) A B&N store is always nearby to get help in person and they currently offer a free book per week when you visit the store (in week 2 of 5 right now)\n\n9) Using independent free software available on the web (Calibre), I can convert and \"sideload\" documents and news feeds to my nook.  I have sideloaded web pages (originally saved as HTML), word documents and .pdf's, all in .epub format.  This is no doubt possible with Kindle too, but the nook is more than flexible for my needs.  I read USA Today and The BBC news feeds on my nook every day and they include B&W photos and diagrams which are clearly readable.  Calibre has many more available.\n\n10) Using Sigil, again free software, I can modify e-books to add chapters or correct errors and sideload them to my nook.  Again, no doubt a possibility with Kindle, but I am not sure.\n\n11)  Nook is just the one size, no Kindle DX equivalent.  For my needs though, the small nook is \"back pocket\" sized (literally fitting in my back pocket) and is small enough to read but carry around.  I need reading glasses without exception to read and so can read at the smallest text size with no problem.\n\n12)  I'm not bothered about having a music player and the built-in speakers are not really capable as listening devices (tinny and low volume), but it's there and will no doubt allow for text-to-speech in a future software release, which will be useful.  The sound quality through headphones is good.\n\nI've had my nook a week and have read two books and many daily news articles.  It's comfortable to use, it's fun to use and while maybe a luxury we could all do without, I've read a couple free e-books that otherwise, I would never have done - and I have many more downloaded and ready in the wings.  It's actually now a hassle to read through a real paperback or hardcover.  :-)\n\nThe choice is yours, but my choice was the nook and I think it was a good choice.\n\nUPDATE 6/2/10 - .PDF's on the nook\n\nI have found that .pdf books, especially with charts and diagrams (ie technical/text books) are problematic to read on the nook.  Interestingly the B&N store personnel stated that they had never tried to read a .pdf on the nook - maybe just a way to avoid the issue??  However, the Kindle will no doubt have the same issue, unless you use the DX which is larger and so you can read .pdf's natively.\n\nIf you read a native .pdf on the nook it is the whole page squeezed down to the 5\" screen - impossible to read.  If you use Calibre to convert the .pdf to .epub format, then the end result is variable.  Diagrams get screwed up or disappear and while text can be enlarged with the font size function, even the text formatting may or may not be acceptable.\n\nEither way, I have given up trying to read such books on my nook.  :-(\n\nI would not recommend the nook to anyone trying to use it for school where .pdf's are the only format available.  The problem is not nook/Kindle, but the way .pdf's are created.  They don't have the necessary information encoded to be able to convert them to other e-reader formats and retain their .pdf look.  If you are going to save any documents for conversion to .epub format, don't use .pdf.  I have found saving as .HTML renders a perfectly acceptable .epub file when converted, including diagrams and charts when archiving web pages, for example.\n\nSee also my review of the JAVOedge Snake Skin Case for Barnes & Nobles Nook (Flip Style)", "summary": "nook review", "unixReviewTime": 1275177600}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2010", "reviewerID": "A35V0TDX1P4UJC", "asin": "1400599997", "reviewerName": "D. Ault", "reviewText": "All in all, this is a good product with a few annoying features.\nOne of the \"bugs\" I find most annoying involves the lack of response from the touchscreen. If the touchscreen has gone dark and you wish to revive it, sometimes it ignores your repeated touches and continues snoozing. It eventually responds and comes back to life, but it often feels a bit like trying to wake a dozing teenager.  You just have to keep poking it.  This makes me wonder; What is this nook's CPU doing that is so important that it has to ignore ME?  Am I, The Reader, not the top interrupt priority?  I mean, who paid for this thing anyway?  Just because I have become accustomed to this disrespectful treatment from my PC doesn't mean it is acceptable from all of my electronic devices.", "summary": "What?

Reads PDF (both scanned and standard text) and EPUB book formats with no hassles or conversion required. In-store help and extra features from B&N. Page turning speed is much improved with most recent update. Android OS allows for almost unlimited software improvements and added features. Replacement batteries can be bought and installed easily. Accepts SD cards for increased storage capacity (this really comes in handy if you want to use the device as an mp3 player or for audiobooks).\n\nCons: eInk display requires you to operate at a bit slower pace than the touchscreen alone would allow. (Also: Not sure why the price from this supplier is abnormally high?)\n\nI've played with an iPad and it's a very fun device. But what I don't like is a glowing backlit screen, as I look at a monitor all day. When I read, I want to relax and give my eyes a break, and that's why I prefer eInk displays.\n\nThe Nook's primary advantage over the Kindle is that it allows you to read EPUB and PDF books (scanned or text; either works) and buy books from various online ebook stores, including the Sony Reader store. This has already allowed me to read two titles that I wouldn't have been able to get for the Kindle. It also works very easily with Adobe Digital Editions software, a huge plus. Currently Amazon offers some titles that B&N does not (a very temporary state of affairs, I suspect), but those are usually available from Sony.\n\nAdd the book loan feature, free library books, and the ability to take it to a B&N store for bonus features, and this unit pretty much stomps the Kindle and Sony readers.\n\nThe Nook is a little slower than a phone or your other electronic devices due to the e-Ink screen, but once you get used to it, the device seems very smooth. In fact, I find that having to slow down a little actually helps me relax, and once you master turning pages with a quick brush of the thumb across the touchscreen, reading with the Nook is a very pleasant experience.

Biggest waste of money I ever spent.  not worth the hassle of getting it repaired.  Made me miserable and unhappy for three days.  This is not how I want to spend my life--feeling miserable and abused and wondering how I got suckered into this huge mistake.\n\nThe good--or perhaps the OK--I found nothing really good.\n\nGSM service is free for purchasing books and most uses. Not all that valuable.  I'd be happy with just WiFi and enough memory to carry around a personal library. with me.  GSM available for anything else but books.  Wifi works ok, after some fussing with the settings.  Many times I got error messages.  I kept trying until it worked.  There is some issue with the Wifi but it can be fussed with until it works--starting and stopping it.\n\nThe bad--just about everything:\n\nI travel a lot, and need to carry my library with me.  This device does not work to download books outside of the US.  Why not?  I can understand the GSM not working, but if I have WiFi access somewhere, I should be able to load anything I want anywhere.  I can load books anywhere with my iPod Touch. Requires a US address.  Why?  Why can't anyone use it?  Device requires that you sign up with B&N with a credit card.  Why can't I download free books without a B&N account?  You cannot use this device until it is registered.\n\nThis device is barely functional.  The interface is poorly designed, B&N does a great job of making it difficult to find free books, and the books that are normally free--B&N charges you $1 to $2 for these books! Outrageous!  Most people would not have a clue they are being ripped off being charged for books in the public domain.\n\nThe interface is so bad that everyone is hacking these devices to make them functional.  Do a GOOGLE search for nook soft root--better yet check out YouTube and search for TROOK.\n\nDo a search on nook itself for free and you won't find free books, you will find books with \"free\" in the title or crippled editions with two chapters free.  There is no menu selection for find free books.  If you do find a free book it will be after wading through page after page of the same title--it would take days to find even a few interesting free books.  With the Kindle, at least you get to choose a few best sellers are part of your purchase price.  The B&N give you nothing for free but garbage.  They want to frustrated enough to pay them more money for overpriced books.  Personally I can't see paying the same price for an electronic book as I do a paper bound book that I can resell or give as a gift.  Electronic books cost nothing to produce and distribute--why do they cost so much?  It is gouging, IMHO.\n\nTo get a free book into your nook is a nightmare PITA.  I use an iPod Touch and was able to load 60 free books into it, in about 8 minutes--easy and simple.  Not menu after menu and then find out the book was not loaded after all.\n\nWith B&N nook it takes a long time to select and load a book.  You have to pay for a book, even if it is zero dollars--another menu choice, just to get you in the habit of hitting a purchase button.  There are lots of free books out there.  Why should it be hard to load these? Personally, I want a large library with me because I travel alot, and I want to find  what I want quickly, and I want to read it without hassle.\n\nPFD files can be loaded but these are not re-sized, so that type is pretty small and hard to read.  I can't read them, and I have reasonably good near vision.  If you are young with perfect vision you might be able to read for a while until your eyes get tired.  PDF don't work well on this device.\n\nChanging a page is a pain with the controls.  There is a way to use a finger swipe that some people have difficulty with.\n\nI personally hate wading through 40-60 pages on the life of the author, at the beginning of the book when all I want to do is read the book itself.  Books with a ton of crap in the front, with articles about the life of the author, acknowledgments, are a PITA toget around.  Scrolling down to chapter one to start the book is problematic--sometimes you are sent back to the index, other times you go to Chapter one. Why should I have to scroll and enter a command twice.  Why can't it work the first time?\n\nI constantly had the urge to use the white part of the device as a touch screen, but only the bottom is a touch screen.  I found myself thinking, my iPod Touch is better than this.  It is fast to touch what I want.  Give me something better like a Blackberry pointer ball!\n\nDisplay is flashing every time a page is changed.  I found this constantly annoying.  Why?  There is no reason for the flashing.  EVERY PAGE FLASHES AT YOU!  YOU WILL LEARN TO HATE IT!!!!\n\nUSB power connector.  This is a weak spot of the device.  Instead of using a robust connector, they use a micro USB connector. It is wobbly. Even a mini-USB would have been better.  At times I  could not make this connector work.  It is delicate.  It doesn't want to mate up.  I found I needed to be very precise on aligning it, even then it would not connect.  I doubt that this will survive 100 re-connections.  If you buy this device, do not expect it to last more than two years.  It would be smart to get the extended warrantee--another $60 for two years--If you buy a nook.  Charge it only when you have too, or you will wear out this connector in a short period of time.  While the battery life is good, given the crappy connector, I don't understand why they didn't put a battery 2-3 times larger in this device so that the connector would last longer and have less wear.\n\nMemory Storage is limited to about 1GB with space to add another memory card.  To bring it up to 8 or 16 GB, it will cost you another $30 to $60, or if you buy it from B&N it will be twice as much.  I feel the device is worthless without at least another 8GB of storage.  I'd rather it came with another 16GB.  The iPad comes with that much or more--so you get a color full touch screen for not much more than the cost of the memory you need.\n\nThis is a good gift for someone clueless about electronics that won't know any better about how badly B&N crippled their android operating system and don't understand what a good interface is all about.\n\nDo yourself a favor.  Try an iPod Touch, and I assume the iPad works as well.  Apple makes quality products that work right, with strong connectors, great software, and are backed up with the highest rated customer support.  B&N built something with one purpose only, to sell electronic books--and to make it difficult to find free books, and to break quickly.  If you want to be screwwed over, buy one of these and then bend over because B&N sees you as someone to be used and abused--not a valuable customer.\n\nIf B&N made it easy to download free books, I'd be more forgiving on the crappy software they use and the delicate power connector.  If B&N made a decent, usable interface, and made it easy to load whole library's of free books, I'd probably buy some electronic books and they would earn my business.  As it is, I will never buy an e-Book or any other book from B&N.  That is how angry I am about wasting money on this product.\n\nMy nook is dead after only three days.  I wish I could return it.  I don't have the original packaging either, so that even if I got a new replacement, I cannot sell it on eBay to get my money back.  I'm not sure what I'll do.  I will be calling B&N tomorrow to see about a replacement, and begging for a store credit instead so I can buy an iPad instead.\n\nThe bottom line is, I'm more than disappointed about the product.  I'm angry enough that I'll never do business with B&N again--even if they refund me the price of this device.  I don't even want it back if it were repaired.\n\nI'd rather pay $600 for an iPad, purchasing from a company that charges a lot for products that are well thought out and work well.  While I may wish the price was less for Apple products, at least I don't have this awful feeling of being screwwed ten different ways by B&N with their service and nook product.\n\nFor those who think this is a good product.

You can organize by author and title, but that's about it. Sorting through sideloaded media, if you have a lot of it, can be a real pain. Also, there's no way to delete B&N books. They have to be archived, which means they are still on the nook taking up space.\n\nA couple of firmware changes have fixed some of the issues with the nook, but there are some problems (such as the Etch-A-Sketch effect described above) that may never be resolved. I was, for the most part, aware of these issues before I made my purchase, so it was not that big of a deal to me as it might be for other potential buyers. Overall, the nook is a gorgeous e-reader (at least compared to the 1980s retro style of the Kindle), and it does its job quite effectively.\n\nI would heartily suggest the nook to anyone that needs a relatively well-priced e-reader that has access to a massive library of e-books and various formats.\n\nEDIT 7/14/10: After the latest software updates, my nook experience has drastically improved. Page turns are much faster, and though the Etch-A-Sketch effect is still there it's nowhere near as noticeable. B&N has added general browsing to the wi-fi; it's a pain to navigate, but the option is now there for people who need to access the internet. Games have been added- Sudoku and Chess.

Its pdf support is much better than Kindle, supporting reflow. that way, you see the page as the native format with real page numbers. it is quite readable if your file is basically text. I don't know if Kindle has improved in this regard but when I bought and returned Kindle DX six months ago, this feature wasn't there and pdf looked more like an image than text. Even DX's large size did not help me read pdf books because it was small and dimmer than regular text. Now on Nook I can read them as though they are in native format. no conversion is needed. but again these are mainly text-heavy pdf files, not complex, graphic-heavy ones.\nsecond area where Nook is better is the screen clarity, the contrast between the background and the font is much better than my experience of Kindle DX.\nThird, user replaceable battery and additional memory slot is a plus for me as I intend to use the device overseas at some point. In case of a problem with the battery, international users have to send your Kindles to the United States for battery replacement? Nook replacement battery costs $30.\nFourth, a better looking device. I don't need the keyboard but it takes a significant space on Kindle 2. the LCD screen works fine but it reflects light and consumes battery when reading so this might not be necessarily a plus. perhaps a physical keyboard that can be separated from the device might do a better job.\nFift, support for more file formats, particularly epub.\nNote: Nook is speedier than many reviewers here suggest. I suspect it is due to the new software update. I was able to swipe through pages with no difficulty.\n\nKindle advantages:\n1. slightly cheaper with no tax and easy to return; amazon.com's wonderful return policy. (so far I have bought hundreds of products on amazon, and returned only a few of them but the reason why I bought them here is because of the return policy. amazon.com is simply the best online retailer in the US with the best customer service). BN will impose restocking fees if you have opened it. But BN offers some deals when you visit one of their stores if you live near-by.\n2. availability of international 3G support where you can buy books. Nook needs to catch up on this.\n3. better, usable dictionary. Nook dictionary is hidden behind a few clicks on the LCD which makes it really unpractical.\n4. its experimental browser which allows you to open other websites. I don't need a browser in a reader but in case of need it is a good feature.\n5. better ebook library. but BN is fast catching up and the ebook that I bought yesterday was cheaper at BN by four dollars. maybe that's an exception but deserves mention. but epub/pdf availability on Nook makes it superior in my opinion. also, new devices such as Irex and Que readers will use BN's collection so more machines will be available, which will improve BN's economies of scale.\n\nTo sum up, for me the deal-breaker was pdf reflow without conversion into native format, user changeable battery and additional memory slot. These features are available on Nook but not on Kindle. Nook should improve on user interface to rely less on LCD during reading (such as dictionary), make LCD less reflective, international 3G access and ability to buy books. It is a four-star device.\n\nFinally, kudos to Amazon to allow comments on competitor products.

When Kindle 2 came out, I decided it was finally time to purchase one, and decided to use Amazon's customer reviews to guide me.  Several things stood out to me that I believed would be a problem for me in the future that I could not overlook:  the proprietary nature of the Kindle e-book format and inability to read other formats, the absence of an expansion slot for an SD card, and the organizational issues that people were having with their books on the device when not using the online services.  After searching for a bit, I discovered that almost all the complaints from Kindle 2 users were addressed by Barnes & Noble in the Nook, including the (limited) ability to loan books (which wasn't really an issue for me, but I could see as a plus in the future.)\n\nThe device is beautiful, and it feels good in my hands.  It is a joy to read on it, and I find the size is perfect for me.  After I was able to get it out of its substantial and extremely protective packing,I plugged it in to charge per the instructions and proceeded to try it out.  When I pulled up a book that I had been reading using their e-reader software while waiting for my Nook to arrive, it froze on the loading screen and could not be rebooted using any method in their manual.  Upon searching the forums, I discovered that if your device and B&N's library are out of sync, the software gets \"confused\" about what page to open to and will freeze.  The solution was to completely remove the battery and plug the machine in without it before re-inserting the battery.  That was rather annoying, but the version update seemed to fix that problem for me.\n\nI gave the device 4 stars out of 5 because it has the potential to be perfect, but has a few issues that leave it short of the mark. The first is that the battery management leaves a LOT to be desired.  It simply doesn't perform as advertised.  It sucks battery power like mad (for an e-reader) even with all their power-saving strategies in place.  If you are in a position to charge your Nook every night or ever other night, then this wouldn't be an issue for you.  The second is that the response of the machine is laggy.  I understand that it is improved from where it started, but even so, it is slow to load, and slow to respond to taps and key presses.  Even so, it's still not slower than turning a page in an actual book.  It makes entering anything in via keyboard excruciating.\n\nThe 3G is amazing.  I love the ability to \"interface with the mother-ship\" as someone on the forums so aptly termed it.  I love the ability to \"hot-spot\" my home network to increase my interface speed.  I love to buy a book from my wish-list on a whim and at the push of a button.  I love the ability to scroll through the book covers to find the novel I want without having to tab through every book I own.  I don't love how much the touchpad sucks the battery.  It's a very cool tool that must be used sparingly, and as such, almost completely takes the advantage of having it away.  I don't like that the entire back has to pop off to get to the battery or the SD card.  I had envisioned buying a batch of cards and using them as a kind of \"bookshelf\".  However, the inability to easily access it takes the convenience of that away as well.  The expansion and extra storage is there, but will only be of efficient use if you want to expand beyond 1,500 books to 1,501 and so on.\n\nI had rather hoped that I could replace my book-buying habit with e-books, but have since discovered that not all the books I want are in e-book format, Kindle or otherwise.  No Harry Potter books? That one hurts.  Ender's Game Series? Negative.  Stephen Lawhead? Many of those I can't replace with digital copies.  Oh so much older science fiction that I'd love to have at my fingertips...we're just not there yet.\n\nBottom line, though: if the battery were to last the full 10 days using it under standard reading conditions, if I could easily organize my books into a logical order that I like and not have to use the virtual keyboard to search, and if the response of the system were quick enough to make the virtual keyboard easier to use, it would be everything that I want it to be.  The rest is up to the authors and their publishers.\n\n**EDIT 08-23-11**\nWell, I had to send the first unit back after 7 months of use because one of the arrow buttons cracked in the middle, and I almost exclusively use the window-swipe portion for page turning, which is a feature I really adore.  No problem, they shipped me a new (refurbished, as per the rules) one without no trouble at all.  In fact, they had a new one to me within a few days, at which point all I had to do was package it in the same box and return it.  Great customer service.\n\nHOWEVER...over the months since, I have experienced the e-ink display \"greying-out\" a bit at a time.  The text become lighter and more difficult to read.  It would become dark again when I flipped the page, but still disconcerting.  Fast-forward to a week ago.  There was a hardware update for the machine, and once complete, I now have screen artifacts that will not go away.  It started as one horizontal and one vertical line.  I reset it to factory defaults, but it was too late.  More appeared, along with darkening of the screen to the point that I can no longer see anything and have to reset it.  The screen is ruined.  I don't know what happened, but since then it has gotten even worse.  It is no longer possible for me to read on it, it's out of warranty, and I cannot afford to replace it with a 3g version.  So...although I loved it, I no longer trust Nook.  I will miss it, but I think it's time to finally go with Kindle.  Now how the heck am I ever going to replace all those books I bought that I can no longer READ?? I realize that isn't exclusively a Barnes and Noble issue, but I paid for a book that I can no longer LEGALLY read on another device.

I just carefully read all of the negative reviews. There is so much mis-information in those posts you can only come to one conclusion. I would say most of these reviews are staged. Unfortunately fanboys of products love to use their anonymity of the Internet to drag down the competition. Before you beLIEve what you read here, go to a Barnes and Noble store and you can actually hold and use a demo unit. If you are still in doubt of the nook, simply vist the Kindle Boards forums, you can Google it. They have a board \"Other eReaders\" and read the positive raves about the nook from actual Kindle owners.)\n\nI can tell you the Nook I just purchased came with release 1.2 and it absolutely rocks!\n\nOne of my Co-workers loaned me his Kindle 2 for a couple of hours so I could get a feel for both devices before I made my decision to purchase. I am not going to bad mouth the Kindle 2 as I am sure it is a fine device. My decision to buy the Nook was based on a few key features I thought important enough to sway me one way over the other.\n\nWhile in the B&N store, I immediately fell in love with the very intuitive and responsive touch navigation. It just feels natural. I did not even have to look at instructions or guides to figure out how to use the Nook. Great job on the UI design.\n\nAfter my purchase, I immediately opened the Nook while in store and the device simply connected to the B&N hotspot without user interaction (NICE!). Since I already have a B&N account from the many books I have ordered online, my registration literally took 30 seconds. I just signed in and it was done.\n\nI was so excited, I purchased a book while in the store and sat down and began to read. Since my card info is already stored, buying was a breeze! I just clicked purchase and confirmed, nothing else. My book was available almost immediately.\n\nThe Nook feels to be a very solidly built device. The screen size is large and the font is crystal clear. I wish it would have come with a protective case, but while I am here on Amazon...\n\n(Key feature in decision to purchase the Nook) Wi-Fi! I am so happy that included Wi-Fi and not just AT&Ts 3G network. We have very spotty cellular coverage in our area. Including Wi-Fi just seems like a no brainer. (Don't worry Kindle fans, I sure it will be included in the K3)\n\n(Key feature in decision to purchase the Nook) Expandable Memory. By trade I am a Network Engineer and carry loads of .pdf technical reference guides with me on my Notebook computer. It will be nice to have them at my fingertips.\n\n(Key feature in decision to purchase the Nook) LendMe - The LendMe feature allows you to lend books to other Nook owner for up to 2 weeks. Sweet!\n\n(Key feature in decision to purchase the Nook) The Nook has a replaceable battery. Why wouldn't that be included in the design of the Kindle beats me. Having to ship the unit back and pay $59? I don't get it.\n\nMiner points that affected my buying decision\n\nKnow the device has the Android OS is a plus. I have found my Android based cell phone is very stable and customizable.\n\nThe personalized screensaver is nice.\n\nIf you are shopping for an eReader I think either way you go, Nook, Kindle, Sony, etc. eReaders are fun and take reading to the next level.

Just as I don't see the need to choose between PC and Mac and just keep one of each around, I don't see that this is a fight that is necessary. There are a handful of books for Nook that I can't get on Kindle, and a bit more than a handful of books on Kindle I can't get on the Nook.\n\nThe device is beautiful. I love the solid rubber backing. The aluminum backing on the Kindle sure looks nice but on a cold Colorado night I do prefer the rubber. It is really nice to see the book cover in full color and with the 1.2 update they just pushed out the device is just as snappy as I would want. Sure it's not going to win any speed contests, but it's supposed to be simulating a book. Not exactly a high speed sport. Page turns seem to be just the same or only very slightly slower than my Kindle 2.\n\nThe free comedic articles in the Daily section are quite funny and the intersting things that pop up when you take it into a Barnes and Noble store are quite fun.\n\nI am disappointed in some of the ommisions from the book store though. EVE: The Empyrean Age and the JPS Student's Tanakh were two things that I have on my Kindle that I read often that are no where to be found on the Nook. In fact there are no Tanakhs at all for the Nook, but a good bakers dozen Christian Bibles. If I were more paranoid I'd probably be offended by that.\n\nI do like the fact that the nook can take ePub books though. I can always pop over to Diesel Books and purchase my missing books and transfer them straight over, which takes a bit of the sting out of the missing library.\n\nAll in all I would recommend the Nook to anyone who lives near a Barnes and Noble.

She was having so much fun with it I decided to get an ereader for myself but I was drawn more toward the Nook. I read so many bad reviews about the Nook I wasn't sure if I should get it or a Kindle or maybe something different with a touch screen and wireless connection. I thought about it for a few weeks and noticed that the reviews started getting better. I decided to go for it. I ordered it last Wednesday from B&N and received it 2 days later. I am so happy I did. I didn't experience any of the the negatives I read about with exception that battery could stay charged longer. Talking about the battery, it's nice to know that you can change it yourself and at a much lessor expense than with a Kindle. I'll probably never need it but it's also nice to be able to add a memory card to hold more content. And the Nook just looks nicer in my opinion.\n\nThe new update was released the same day I received my Nook and I updated the firmware the second day I had it and it runs even more smoother. I have been a gadget man all my life but this is my first touch screen device. I had no problems what-so-ever navigating the menus and the menus changed fast enough for me.\n\nMy wife still loves her Kindle but I think she is a little jealous. She asked me why I didn't get her a Nook for Christmas.\n\nI was completely in the dark about ereaders until just 2 months ago. I know during my research I found people that were experiencing  problems and were unhappy with every reader I checked into. If you were putting off getting a Nook because of bad reviews, I would give them another look. There has been 2 firmware updates already that probably addressed many of the earlier concerns. That's not bad for a device that was only released a short while ago. I'm sure there will be further updates as time goes on and it will get only better.\n\n~eddie", "summary": "Glad I gave it a chance", "unixReviewTime": 1265760000}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "6", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2010", "reviewerID": "A2C4O93BXM5ROE", "asin": "1400599997", "reviewerName": "Dexlin", "reviewText": "After MONTHS of research for my first ereader I finally decided on the Nook. With all the buzz, I, of course, ran out to BN to see the Nook when it first came out and was incredibly disappointed at that time as it was painfully sluggish and I had almost crossed it off my list for purchase. However, I went back and saw it again at the store after about 6 weeks from my first viewing and what a difference! Barnes and Noble has made great strides. A friend showed me her Kindle and I got to play with it and I looked in stores and saw the Sony reader as well. Did MUCH research online as well on some of the others such as Jetbook Lite.\n\nAs much as I LOVE Amazon and shop here more often than I probably should LOL. I decided on the Nook seeing the improvements that were already made in that short amount of time. What sealed the deal for me was the SD card option to expand memory AND you can change the battery yourself as opposed to having to send your device back over a simple battery change.\n\nI am not regretting my decision to go with the Nook at all. I have to admit that it did freeze up on me twice, BUT it only did that when I interrupted the charging process. So, I don't know exactly what caused that. No problems at all while reading. As far as reading on the Nook, its a great device. Downloading books is fast and simple to do. Page turning is fast now. Its a dream come true for an avid reader like me.\n\nThe only con that I've noticed so far is battery life. I think its a huge stretch to say the battery lasts 10 days. However, the wi-fi turns itself off after being idle for a minute or so, so you don't have to manually turn it off. When you activate the menu, it will reconnect to the network. So, BN is making an effort to increase battery life without much manual interaction.\n\nI highly recommend the Nook.

I loved the look and feel of this device and was looking forward to the convenience of buying more books without adding more clutter to my already cluttered bookcases. I read all of the pros and cons of owning a Kindle and compared it to the pros and cons of owning a nook. The nook won because of its versatility (epub format, book lending, etc).\n\nMy nook arrived on January 28th. Since then, I've experienced one crash and had to figure out how to use the touchscreen so that I can flip the pages without having to use the arrow keys. The latter took some practice, but I eventually mastered it and have been enjoying this feature ever since. I've also read three books in the space of a week, which is a personal record for me, as it normally takes two weeks for me to read a single paperback, longer if I'm reading an ebook on an LCD screen.\n\nThe eInk technology is fabulous. I can read all day (and do) without eyestrain. The letters are very crisp on a plain white background. Even better, you can adjust the font size from small to extra large. Not only that but the nook comes with several fonts: Amasis, Helvetica Neue and Light Classic. I'm happy with the Amasis as it resembles Times Roman.\n\nMy only complaint so far is that I am not able to categorize my books into categories. At the moment, I'm forced to wade through my list until I find the book that I want to read. B&N has already sent out an update, which is a good improvement over the old interface. While the touch interface can be a bit buggy (Sometimes you have to flick your finger more than once or use the arrow keys to turn the page.), I can turn pages in one second compared to the 2-3 seconds it would take with the original software. That wasn't a big deal until I received the upgrade.\n\nI also like what they've done with the bookmarks feature. Before, they had a strange numerical format for bookmarks. With this upgrade, it lists the page that you bookmarked, which is much nicer.\n\nI love how I can download samples of ebooks directly from my nook without having to rely on the B&N site to do everything. Once you finish the sample, you have the option to buy. If you decide to buy the book, you will be taken to the last page you read so that you can continue from there. You can also archive the books that you've read directly from your nook with the press of a button, which helps manage your list.\n\nSideloading my pdf ebooks onto my nook was an easy experience. However, you can't categorize your documents; you can only sort them by title or author.\n\nAnother great aspect of owning a nook is that you can check out ebooks from your local libraries (see [...] for a list of libraries near you), sideload books that you have bought from Fictionwise and other ebook stores, and download free ebooks from either the B&N site or Google Books. That's what ultimately sold me on the nook, the versatility and freedom to choose where I want to buy or download free ebooks. The nook is not proprietary, unlike the Kindle and the soon-to-be-released iPad.\n\nThe interface is very easy to use. It comes with a manual that you can read on the device, or on the B&N website. If you're still stuck on an issue, I found this great forum ([...]) with friendly people who can help you.\n\nI've yet to check out the Lend feature because my family and friends have yet to embrace this technology.\n\nOther than my issue with organization, I am really enjoying my nook. I'm looking forward to reading many books in the future, thanks to this wonderful device. Highly recommended.\n\nSide note: I agree with S. Dayton about the iPad. After reading a few ebooks on my iTouch and my Mac, I have to agree with him about the eyestrain. For casual surfing and watching video, LCD works fine.

They are quick to criticize, and slow to praise. I've read all the criticisms on here thus far and while some have a point, most are absolutely ridiculous or downright untruthful. One guy said he bought four Nooks for Christmas and three out of the four were either rendered inoperable or ceased to function altogether. Sounds like an Amazon-paid poster to me...fishy story.\n\nPlease know that I'm not partial to B&N. It's a bookstore. I have no loyalty to them as they have never put out an electronic product before. At the same time, I also own some Sony products and they continue to work either fine or great. I don't hate Amazon, nor the Kindle. In fact, I use Amazon for purchases frequently and I would have bought the Kindle if I was partial to it. Same goes for Sony. However, I did my own comparitive research on e-readers and concluded with the Nook being the best fit for me, my needs, and my expectations. All so far, have been met. Whatever the case with negative \"geek\" reviews, here's my take on the Nook:\n\n- It's out-of-the-box easy and very intuitive. Mine came on Saturday, and by that evening I had: 1)set up my B&N account, 2)fully charged my unit, 3)connected to my in-home wireless network, 4)set to my personal preferences (complete with personalized wallpaper & screensavers), 5)downloaded some easy-listening music, 6)dragged over a PDF file from work, 7)and downloaded three books (2 purchased, 1 free) from the B&N link to enjoy. All this done before dinner...\n- The Eink display rules. I actually find it easier to read than an actual book, especially considering the fact that I am holding a digital unit near half the actual size of a tried-and-true book. It's light, sleek, slim, portable and cool.\n- While the touch screen is one way to go, it is not really necessary. And you really need to adjust the brightness on it pretty much from the get-go. It's like staring into headlights while trying to read. But once I did adjust the brightness as well as the touch screen timer (10 sec, 30 sec or 60 sec), it was actually a nice to have function.\n- After initially fully charging the unit, my Nook has lasted going-on 4 days now. Those who complain it doesn't last 10-12 days, while they are justified at being angry with B&N for \"false\" advertising, I still see no problem. I never read their claim for this sort of durability, thus, I'm not upset with having to charge my unit every 2-3 days. I see it the same as I see my cell phone or Ipod. And hopefully in the near future Powermat will come out with a Nook adapter...\n- SD Card option. Not necessary. But nice option to have. Already bought one. Already installed one. Easy cheesy...16GB...BAM!!!\n- Wi-Fi connectivity capability. I have a standard wireless router in my house. I was up & running in minutes. My first wi-fi purchase was Treasure Island for $.99 and then got a free copy of the Oxford Holy Bible. The B&N library is second-to-none when it comes to finding what you are looking for on e-book.\n- Bookmarks...I don't see the problem??? I haven't even upgraded my firmware yet, but every time I open up a book in My Library on my Nook, it goes directly to the page I last read. And this is done whether I leave a bookmark or not. It just does it...so what's everyone complaining about? I have 10 items in My Library so far and it does this for each item, except my PDF files from work.\n- Browser capability, or lack thereof...biggest dissappointment for me. If they could create a Netbook/E-Reader that was the size of an e-reader, but possessed the \"little PC\" functionality of a netbook, I would be in heaven. Until they do, I have both. Depending on the Kindle's capability, perhaps this is a strong seller for others out there. But for me, the Nook's other features outweighed not having a web browser capability.\n\nBottom Line: For me, I love it. Best little toy I've purchased in years. Do your own research, and pick the best e-reader for you. IMHO, I think it's great and it's only going to get better in the future.

The battery life is misrepresented by B&N. The only way you could possibly get 10 days out of the battery is if it is off. However, 2 to 4 days is a real possibility, So, bring your charger or USB to computer cable. Just like Apple IPOD, the B&N folks decided to use a non-standard USB cable that appears to match the Apple ones. This is a minor problem, but do not expect to borrow a USB cable from someone while on travel. The included small charger worked very well.\n\nThe key thing is how does the NOOK function as a book reader. In my opinion, it is adequate, and no more. I downloaded a number of free books without any problem. I also downloaded some paid books form B&N. Once again, no problem. Finally, I downloaded some books from my public library onto my computer (not the NOOK)using the free Adobe software. Using the USB cable to my NOOK, I simply dragged the books to the NOOK, and voila, two seocnds later they were available for 14 days. So far so good. One could now rant about the interface (so-so), or the fact that you should reduce the color-screen brightness to about 10% to save the battery as well as turn off the WI-FI when not in use, and so forth, but how does it work when reading a book.\n\nIf you are like me, and read fairly fast, most books will be a real page turners, since there is not much on a page compared to a real print on paper book. The print is clear. It is faily black on a slightly grey background (some might say off-white), which under a bright reading light is quite comfortable. For the eyesight challenged, there are bigger fonts accompanied with still more page turning. The same is true of the KINDLE. Page turning is easy and intuitive, so not a problem. Use the buttons on the side, not the color interface.\n\nA big feature of the NOOK is the ability to add a memory card. Well it is true you can do this, but it is not for the faint of heart or fingernail impaired. The first time you try to open the NOOK using the nearly invisible tab, you will wonder if you are going to break the cover. Just be careful, follow the instructions, and all will be well. Now, why would you want to add memory. As it arrives, the NOOK holds a huge number of books. You might want to add some of your work in PDF documents - this chews up space fast - and the pdf reading capability is primitive at best. Get a small netbook for this purpose and leave the NOOK for books. Changing the battery-RIGHT! Perhaps at the end of life, 2 to 3 years, to save a service trip. By then the technology will be antique, and you will replace the whole NOOK, not just the battery.\n\nA disappointment is the lack of even a primitive browser so that you could check email without lugging along another computer. The KINDLE has this feature. The NOOK can be \"upgraded\" to also have a browser, but then it is non-standard, and you might have trouble as B&N upgrades the official firmware. Perhaps B&N will relent and give us email capability similar to the APPLE I-Touch. I can understand not wanting to overload AT&T with too much traffic, but simple text emails should not have been a problem.\n\nFinally, why would you want a NOOK in the first place. Remember, real books use no power, are truly random access, can be lent to anyone for as long as you like, and will function far into the future regardless of technology changes. The only purpose I can see for having a NOOK is for travel and for electronically borrowing books from a library without getting into your car or walking overmuch. Well, scratch the last, since you can borrow and read books on your computer. The airplane travel or train commute is a biggie. Books are heavy and bulky. Carrying 6 books onto an airplane is a pain. Plus, hauling out your NOOK to read makes you look technically COOL, and for the short term, is sure to start a conversation with a nearby stranger. The conversation might be interesting and better than the NOOK-book you were going to read.\n\nWell, I've written enough and am going to read a book that I just downloaded from the local library.

Now that it is being offered at new prices ($150-180) and has been upgraded to support Google Play Android apps as well as B&N content, the value proposition is much improved.  (Yes, you will have to be patient and let your Nook HD+ do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy!  But it's worth the wait.)\n\nIf you are coming from other Nook devices, you'll feel right at home.  If not, you may be surprised to find the combined \"reader\" and \"Android tablet\" interface pretty nice.  It's well thought out and for the most part works very well.  Take your time and be willing to explore a bit and you'll soon get the hang if  it.  Don't miss the \"Nook Today\" icon which is a clever one, but easily overlooked.  All in all, I was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the UI a bit of a refreshing change.  (Occasionally, you have to use the home key instead of just \"back\" but a minor quibble.) [Note: You can \"override\" the Nook UI and install other \"launchers\" but I, personally, felt no need to do so.  But nice to know the option is there if ever needed.]\n\nThe size is a nice compromise between the smaller units (too small for comfortable long video watching) and the larger units (big, heavy, bulky).  The 8-9\" range seems to be the sweet spot.  The FULL HD (1920x1080 256ppi) screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness.  Videos/movies, YouTube, Photos, Graphics, all look great.  The high quality screen is the big draw here, in my opinion.  Excellent value at the new price point.\n\nThe size, weight (very light for this size device), slimness, and easy handling are all good points of this tablet.  Some do not like the Nook hole on the bottom left, but I am fine with it.  It gives a bit of orientation, an easy place to grab the tablet, and so on.  The styling looks good to me and the slimness is nice and makes it easy to hold and handle.\n\nHD YouTube and Netflix look wonderful.  This is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch Netflix on the go.  I was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems, so the movies sounded great as well.  Bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones, of course.  The built in speaker(s) is OK, but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality (as is true with most tablets).\n\nThe controls are well placed, simple, and easy to use.  The MicroSD card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets.  The proprietary charging port is a minus, a standard USB would have been more flexible, but it works well and charges faster.  The handy \"HOME\" button with the Nook logo is very useful and also works well.\n\nThere are no cameras - and I could care less, but some might.  I'll take the superb screen, great design and build, and other nice features and be happy.  For the techies, it uses 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 proc and 1 GB of RAM.  Not cutting edge, but plenty fast.  Benchmarks I checked were all pretty good and the Nook HD+ is very responsive in use. The back features a nice \"soft touch\" feel that I really like versus many tablets that have a slick back making them prone to being easily dropped.\n\nThe recent update adds the Chrome browser to the NOOK HD+ and web browsing is snappy and works well.  Everything looks great, of course, on the FULL HD screen and the Chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb, formatting them nicely for the Nook HD+.  Chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices, automatically, which is nice.\n\nIf you like Barnes & Noble and their books and movie content, then, of course, that is a win for you as well.  It's all here and well integrated.  Plus there are some Nook HD+ specific apps pre-installed and you should prefer them in most cases.  (Note: I made the mistake of updating the Nook Netflix app with the one from the Google Play store -- big No-No!  It did not work at all.  Once I uninstalled it and went back and reloaded the Nook-branded version from the Nook store (free) -- everything worked fine again. I've had this issue with other tablets as well, the Netflix app seems to be very picky and you need the right one for your specific tablet. I had also installed the Android Pandora over the Nook version, but that one worked fine.  So...if you do this and have issues, just uninstall and reinstall from Nook Store/Cloud vs. Google Play Store and you'll be fine.)\n\nAll of the other Android apps from Google Play that I tried have worked fine.  Pandora, Stitcher Internet Radio, Maps, Amazon MP3, Amazon Kindle (wow! a bit of a surprise!), Gmail, YouTube, etc. all work as expected.  The new openness of the NOOK HD+ is a game changer for the NOOK line, and pushes it way up in the rankings in my opinion.\n\nI bought mine at the local B&N store and there's a lot of help available there if you need it, which is a huge bonus if you are tech challenged and need advice and help locally.  Very friendly staff and great customer service, what a novel concept!  ;)\n\nThe Nook HD+ is a \"sleeper\" - an often overlooked alternative to other more expensive tablets that can both out perform them and well beat them in value, being available currently at very attractive prices.

I realize for those that have come from old hardware or new to tablets might believe this is a bit harsh, but keep in mind this is more of a comparison to other options available out there. Granted there are price differences and for price alone, this is a decent deal.\n\nThe hardware itself is impressive. Bought these for our 4 and 6 years which were upgrading from their Galaxy 2 7\" tablets. The most significant issue with these tablets is the B&N version of an already outdated Android OS_Ice Cream Sandwich, not the latest Jelly Bean which is far far better. It is very clunky and very slow, not at all snappy by any sense, even with the latest updates. I did buy it as they finally put Play on it which was a requirement for me, but the OS itself is just horrible. It does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can open.\n\nAdditionally, as this is an 'overlay' OS, it is very limited in terms of options. Sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles, etc. Many apps on the Google store will indicate not compatible with this device. I generally ROM my Android devices however CM10 is the only one at this time with any support and that ROM is very very buggy compared to say Frosty ROM which is not available for this tablet. It works, but again, not a smooth integration of a ROM. So really, your stuck with what B&N puts on it and at this time, it is very slow and clunky. Now you can 'BUY' a card with Jelly Bean on it, but again, pulling off the card is slower vs. internal memory, though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a 'real' Android OS on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this time.\n\nFor the kids, they still like the tablet, enjoy the better graphics, larger screen, etc. Once going graphics is good, sound is adequate though not great, touch input is good. But for me, I could never use this tablet for serious use. My Asus TF700T is my go to tablet, even over my iPad 4,3,2,etc. At this time I am contemplating just selling these and buy Nexus tablets for the kids instead as it is more a pure Android experience and not hindered by the clunky implementation of an older Android OS. Perhaps if B&N releases an OS based on Jelly Bean it may improve things.\n\nBottom line, there are far better options in the Android world.\n\nPROS\nGood resolution\nTouch is good\nGreat balance of size, not large nor small like a 7\" tablet\nHas Play installed\nExternal memory card option\n\nCONS\nB&N OS is horrible, slow, cluncky, and based on old Ice Cream Sandwich, not Jelly Bean\nSpeakers are just OK\nVery limited accessory options compared to even Kindle HD devices\nCharger plug is very tight on both of my models.

Has an easy to use menu button that lets you hop from one place to another on your Nook. You are able to put allot of your personal content on the home screen, making it really easy to get to your favourite apps and books quickly.\n2. Great storage. The Nook Tablet has 16 GB built in, and the memory is expandable up to 32 GB via a MicroSD[HC] Card. Content stored on card runs pretty fast for a Tablet.\n3. Best-ever e-book reader. Its nothing that can be fought againsed: Nooks are the best e-readers of all time. You can change the size of the text, background page color and picture settings easy. Has a built-in dictionary that can be used to look up words that you don't understand in that new Hunger games best-seller, or just to look up any random word when reading Pilgrim's Progress. Overall, a great E-Reader.\n4. Large selection of apps. The Nook store always will have the newest Fruit Ninja app, the new temple Run and much more. ranging from gaming apps to apps that will help your business thrive, the Nook store has it all.\nCon's\n1. The processor. Sometimes the Nook will run into reboots that can take up to a minute, though they never actually seem to help the Nook itself. It can't handle that many downloads at once, which can make your downloading of the Angry Birds series.\n2. Hard to unlock. Unlike allot of other tablets, Barnes & Noble really have this one guarded. It is very hard to hack it (Legally)to get all of the Google Play apps. There's a card that can do that, but it costs $50. So, not the best for the techy-app types.\n3. Poor speaker. The Nook's speaker isn't the best. Even at full volume it isn't that loud. The only way to really hear anything good is with headphones.\n\nSo, it seems like there's some for getting it and some for not getting it. But it sure works for me.

The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).\n\nVery little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.\n\nYou can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.\n\nYou can root it to get access to more apps.

The Nook tablet works okay for that, but the larger display of the HD+ seemed that it would be an improvement.  However, there are several problems with the current edition:\n\nThere needed to be at least one more font size at the high-end.  I had to choose between too small and too large.\n\nThe sound level was too low, even with headphones.  I could not find a Barnes and Noble application to provide better control over the volume.  There are a number of third-party applications which used to work on the Nook tablet that are now locked out by the current OS version.\n\nSo, in spite of the beautiful display, I reluctantly returned the HD+ to my local store.

No doubt about that!  For viewing movies it's superb!\n\nBut.....there are a lot of things BN needs to fix --- fast!  Things that the Nook Tablet HAS and this one does NOT!\n\nThe Setting interfaces in books and video is now so UN-user Friendly that it is irritating.  On the Nook Tablet, which watching a video, if you tapped on the screen, you could easily option the Brightness setting bar.  Not now.\n\n1) Never mind.\nI STAND CORRECTED.  As of 11.30.2012, my Pandora app works.  B&N must have heard our cries!\n\n2) It does not play Flash videos.  Boo!  This is, admittedly, a problem with many tablets out there.  Many websites are getting away from Flash but for now, you can't watch a website that uses Flash.....except with a very untrustworthy app download.\n\n3) it freezes sometimes after wake up on books.  You have to sometimes re-start the darn thing.  NOT good!  It'll get stuck when you turn a page, even with the animations off.\n\n4) In the Night View, when the Brightness setting is all the way dimmed, (which helps in Power saving) is too dim. NC is much better, still dim but not unreadable.\n\n5) The font size in all areas, all apps (settings, email, contacts, Nook Friends, Pandora etc.)  is ridiculously small. It's even smaller than the font size on the NC and Nook Tablet and it's a bigger size item.  And there is no way to make it bigger.  Nice.  Not.\n\nAs you are reading a book, if you tap on the screen to access the chapters, page slider, font size etc. ---- all of that is way too small and where the heck is the Brightness Slider? Oh, that's right ---- it's not THERE any more!  Who's idiot idea was that?\n\n6) when you tap on a word to access the dictionary, it often freezes or is unresponsive.  Then when the dictionary options do come up, and you tap on Look Up, often THAT freezes. Say what? Oh, and when the definition does appear, the font is so small, it's almost unreadable.\nI normally read my books in a much larger font size and on the NC/NT, the definitions are readable.  Even though this tablet does have Text to Talk, it's not that great and I don't want text to talk, thank you.\n\n7) The web browser does freeze often but this was a big problem with the NC/NT  too.\n\n8) when watching a movie, you cannot easily access the Brightness bar, and when you try to tap on the Movie slider to advance or go back, that sucker disappears faster than you can ever imagine.  On the NT, that slider stayed for at least a few seconds, enough for your finger to get on it.  Very annoying.  Also, again the Brightness button is not easily accessed.  You have to tap on Settings, go to the Brightness setting, adjust it and then find your movie in the Main Menu and reopen it.\n\n9) The keyboard is a joke, as it was on the NC/NT.  Come on, how hard is it to have a \"qwerty\" keyboard with numbers at the top.  All other tablets have that.\n\n10) The Brightness button in not on the tool bar when you are in the book reader as it was in versions past.\n\nIf B&N had kept all the aspects of the Nook Tablet, adding the gorgeous HD display, the larger, less bulky hard drive, and the more robust processor of the HD+ , the Nook HD+ would be a winner-winner, chicken dinner!\n\nHate to say it but:\nMy husband has the new 10\" ASUS HD tablet and I think that's actually a better buy!  You just download the Nook app, which does allow you to view the magazines as on the older Nook Tablet, by the way. I didn't check if the kids' books work (i.e. read to you).

The screen flickers on and off.  If you twist the outer edges a little you can usually get it to start working again for a minute or two.  The Nook was well treated and never dropped.  So while it worked fine for a year... two months out of warranty it is now a paper weight.  So I have lowered its rating from 5 to 3 stars.\n\nOriginal review:\nA year after Barnes and Noble dropped the price approximately one hundred dollars the Nook HD+ 9\" is still one of the best values in the tablet market.  The price is starting to creep up for a new one so keep your eyes open for a sale, but don't wait too long because they are no longer being manufactured.\n\nThere are two primary reasons that I like the Nook HD+ 9\". First of course is the 1920 x 1280 high resolution display.  You will note that  by comparison 1080p is only 1920 x 1080 so this display is 4x3 not 16x9.  In my opinion the extra pixels make browsing web pages more pleasant in both portrait and landscape mode.  The second reason is that this tablet was sold in large numbers so developers have released ROM builds with the latest version of Android KitKat.  These can be used either by flashing the tablet's ROM internally or running KitKat from a micro SD Card and leaving the Nook's original operating system untouched.\n\nWe have numerous Android devices and were able to download everything we needed for free, but their are companies who sell micro SD cards already set up for around $20.  So for a reasonable price one can get a \"rooted\" android tablet without doing much research and with almost no risk to the tablet or your warranty.\n\nThis tablet was originally released in November of 2012.  It has a 1.5 GHz OMAP4470 Dual-Core Processor which is a little slower than the Samsung Exynos 4412 dual-core 1.5GHz processor found in the Galaxy Tab 3 8\" that was released in a few months later in mid 2013.  The processor is good enough to play most formats of HD Video, but struggles with games with 3D graphics.  It performs better with the rooted version of KitKat than with the stock Nook OS.\n\nWe had a Galaxy Tab 3 8\" and now have a Galaxy Tab 4 8\".  They both have a very good GPS and cameras in the front and rear.  The Nook has neither of these features.  But the bigger display with 1920x1280 resolution as compared to 1280x800 on the Galaxy Tabs more than makes up for these shortcomings for most of what we use a tablet for.\n\nMany of these were sold so there is a very good support network.  Lots of accessories are available through Amazon and the other usual suspects.  The hardware has proven to be dependable despite a few people who have reported problems here.  They come with a good warranty and extended warranties are available.  I am giving it 5 stars not because it is the greatest tablet ever made, but because at this time at the prices they are going for on sale... it is the best tablet value that I am currently aware of.", "summary": "Great Value!

I originally operated each Nook with Kit Kat OS off a micro sd card as I didn't want to erase the factory installed OS.  I came to find out Lollipop was available for download.  I paid $15 for the download but I was able to use it on both Nooks.  At $7.5 per upgrade, the money was very well spent.  The factory OS was wait too restrictive and slow.  Lollipop is much better when it comes to manage processor with slow speed and makes the Nook operating much more smooth and faster.  It also opened up to all the apps that are available in Google Play which it was not the case with the factory OS.\n\nI have only played with it for one day but I have no regard in erasing the factory OS and replaced it with the newer OS.  Another advantage is the Nook only comes with 32 gb internal memory.  If you are willing to part way with the B&N OS, you can have up to 64 gb storage between internal and external memories.  I don't know if the external can take more than 32 gb as I am using the micro sd card which was running Kit Kat OS.  I will look into that later.\n\nSuggestion:  If you have a $100 budget and do not mind the tablet does not come with cameras and GPS, an excellent option would be to get a pre-owned Nook and spend $15 for the Lollipop upgrade.

I did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it, almost buying him a kindle fire because I thought it was more \"manly\" looking.

I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn't want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn't be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn't have that I consider a negative is a camera. MY tablet (Acer Picasso) has a camera and I do actually use it quite a bit, but my husband says he wouldn't use one  on a tablet so it doesn't bother him anyway.

I've been wanting an eBook reader for quite awhile, so I was really excited when it arrived by FedEx this morning.\n  I'm a disabled American Veteran, and on a very limited income, so I receive a small allowance each month for my personal items. I had to save for several months in order to purchase an e-book reader. I did a lot of Internet searches, reading, and comparing features before choosing the \"Nook\". I also based my choice on past experiences with Barnes & Noble (book stores). I never expected them to \"ROB\" me as they did.\n  I bought the Nook with my own money, and it is mine. Shame on you B&N for stealing from a loyal (ex) customer. I trusted you and you stole from me.\n  If any of you are thinking about a Nook, \"Be YE Forewarned\", B&N has a nasty little bit of firmware just waiting for you, on the Internet. This little thief will lock up your Nook so you will only be able to download books and apps from Barnes & Noble.\n  You will buy only the things they sell and you will pay their prices. There are so many free apps and ebooks available, but you will not be allowed to have them, if you purchase a Nook. If I had it in my power, I would have everyone to buy some other brand and teach the \"Big Guys\" a lesson on how to treat people. Had I known about this \"Hi Jacking\" of my property, I would not have purchased it. I hate to sound like I'm pissed off, but I am pissed off.\n  With all the nice features, the Nook would be a great piece of technology, were it not for the stinking little virus waiting for you out there in Cyber land.\nTom Mullis\nPS: For those of you who know how, you can do this thing called, \"rooting\", but there are many of us who are not able to do this procedure. And I'm pretty sure Barnes & Noble will soon write a piece of software that will take the Nook back, and prevent you from doing it again. The folks at B&N are not dumb, they will figure it out. They are not dumb, but they are crooks, willing to cheat and steal for that, \"almighty doller\". So beware.\n  By the way, are there any lawyers out there willing to take on a \"class action\" suit?

The reading experience on the Nook is NOT the same as classic e-Readers, which seem to have more of a paper appearance to their screens. Reading on the Nook is just okay and is best in sunlight. I'm not too thrilled about reading on this while in bed, for instance, as it's not as gentle on the eyes when compared to regular eReaders. If you're not used to reading on a regular eReader, this might not be a problem at all for you. If you like the eReader experience, these types of devices will disappoint. While you can change the background color and dim the screen, it is a far inferior reading experience.\n\nI, personally, purchased this device believing there would be some setting that would make the reading experience like one on a regular eReader. While the Nook has a lovely screen and beautiful Netflix playback, it's not a good eReader unless you're reading a lot outdoors.\n\nI bought this knowing that the app selection was poor, but not realizing just how poor it really is. B&N seriously needs to open up this device for more learning apps. After my initial disappointment, I just figured I would let my children have my Nook. It *seems* to be great for kids as they can use the various learning tools, and they're more likely to reread books than I am. But, when it came to looking for various math, spelling, and other learning material for my 7 and 10 year old sons, the selection was dismal at best!\n\nIt's cool to play Angry Birds on a larger screen to the tune of 3 bucks per version... and Drawdle is a huge hit with my boys, but the excitement sort of ends there. The excitement really ended after I paid 2 bucks for a spelling app that isn't even compatible with my device. The way the market is locked down, that shouldn't even be possible! As for Netflix, well... how many places will I have wifi and the time and ability to watch a movie also? At home I can just watch Netflix on the big screen TV. It would be most useful for long car rides if you have mobile hotspot on your phone. But, of course, streaming from your mobile hotspot will just eat up your monthly usage!\n\nAll in all, I say it's a very confused device. If you're looking to buy this, save yourself the money and just buy the Nook Color for $169. The tablet is a little faster and a little lighter in weight, but $250 sort of exceeds this device's usefulness. I was also planning to read library books on my Nook... only to learn that I don't have access to the Overdrive app in order to do so. If there is some roundabout way to accomplish this, I just haven't put in the time to investigate.\n\nI honestly think this device is best suited for kids just because big touch screens are fun. In the end it's an over-sized android phone without the market... or the phone lol. It's a cool toy for a kid (maybe 8-18 years of age) to have for the family on a budget, I guess. But to me, it's starting to feel like a waste of money. I'm not too keen on the reading experience, and while both of my kids are just dying to get time on the Nook, the learning app selection is *severely* limited. However, as my kids aren't as picky as I am, they would actually get some use out of this device as an eReader.

The Nook works flawlessly and the display is really nice. I have an N protocol router and the Nook is quick on the Net. I read some negative reviews here. They appear to be written by folks who want to take a $200 unit and turn it into a $500 unit with various apps and other applications. Here's a news flash for the naysayers.

The people at Walmart didn't want you near them, and didn't know ANYTHING about them. Best Buy was pretty much the same, except you could 'sorta' test them out. BN though had people trained to know EVERYTHING about them, even the stuff that was not listed about them on the BN website.\n\nFirst thing not listed: if the Nook Colour can do it, so can the Nook Tablet. (for instance... read .cbz files without installing any extra apps)\n\nThe 16gb model was much more responsive than the 8gb, so to me it was well worth the extra 50 bucks.\n\nAdd to that that currently if you buy one at BN and don't like it, you have 2 weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition (so no attempting to root the device, which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the Colour)\n\nthat pretty much sold me, I found a place with micro SD cards on sale, bought a few, and took my Nook home.\n\nPros:\nThe screen is AWESOME! I use it for reading .cbz comics and .pdf files more than anything. The missing gap between the glass and screen made reading much better. Also the response on the touch screen was great.\n\nmuch better response time at turning pages, launching apps and using the inet that other tablets in the budget range\n\nnative flash support\n\nnative .cbz support (main reason I bought it)\n\nsupports almost every popular ebook format except for .mobi (which can be converted to epub or .pdf anyway)\n\ngood size for holding one handed for reading and lightweight (under a pound)\n\nbattery life... 11 hours+ with wifi off, 8+ with it on, I tried it out and watched lots of movies and did some reading on it without it coming close to dying on me.\n\na test drive opportunity if you buy it at BN and don't scratch it up or anything. I like the idea that I was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that I want it to do wihtout a fear that I'm stuck with it for good.\n\nalso if you buy it from BN you can buy an 'oops' return warranty (which means if you spill coffee on it or drop it, it can be replaced)\n\naffordable if you go without things like eating out 2x a week for awhile\n\nCons:\nlack of Android Market, lack of some apps I would like to see on the BN market (such as Google Music app) no sideloading apps at the moment either. That being said, this also means that apps available from BN will actually work with your Nook, there isn't a quantity over quality in the app store either. This means that if you've bought an app from Android market, you will have to buy it again if you want to use it on the Nook.\n\nThe screen. trust me, I love it. But unlike other tablets where if you crack the glass you just have to replace the glass, on the Nook if you crack it, the screen is toast\n\nno front facing camera (or any camera for that matter). The ability to use Skype would have been nice, but wasn't a complete necessity. I've had many friends with tablets that had a camera that swear they never used it even once, and thinking about it, I wuld seldom use it either since most places outsite of my house that I will use it are places where video chatting would be frowned on, like Starbucks or the library\n\nno bluetooth, which to me didn't matter, but it seems to be an issue for some people. There IS bluetooth, but it's disabled and there isn't a way to enable it\n\nno GPS, this would be nice, unlike bluetooth, I would actually use it.\n\nmono speaker instead of stereo, again seems to be an issue for other people, I plug it into the minijack on my surround sound at home or the jack in my car stereo when I'm on the road though and its just fine. I use headphones if I'm out and about. Why on earth would I care about speakers that I never use anyway?\n\nno .flac support. a good chunk of my digital music now is .flac. it does have .ogg support though\n\nno .avi support. again, a massive portion of my movies etc are all in .avi format. It does have .mkv and .mp4 support though, so from here on out I will just have to rip my video files in those formats if I plan on watching them on it.\n\nlack of decent accessories selection. lets face it, the case market seems to be geared toward people that worship at the church of Steve, and the availability of accessories shows it.", "summary": "GREAT .cbz (comic file) reader an more!", "unixReviewTime": 1330300800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2012", "reviewerID": "A1089S59XSJT2T", "asin": "1400501466", "reviewerName": "Zachary Leingang", "reviewText": "i got a 16gb microsd off of amazon for under $14.00 and it holds just little over 8k books, it was what swayed be over the kindle fire, that and the 1gb of ram vs 512mb.

Chaika", "reviewText": "Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.\n\nOne other thing: the Nook has a tab for \"My Stuff\" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.\n\nI got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)\n\nHands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, \"Wow! it's as good as the Sony!\"  Yes, and for about the half the price.\n\nAnother salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.\n\nThe Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).\n\nThe Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.\n\nThat's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.\n\nI gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.\n\nThe Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.\n\nYou can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.\n\nIf, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not \"locations\" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.\n\nIn short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.

One reviewer reported even the B&N tech person in the store was unable to enable the Nook Tablet to download library eBooks.\n\nEBooks cannot be directly downloaded onto the Nook.\n\nAccording to my librarian, B&N has made this a more complicated process than on the Kindle Fire, needing more steps, but the Overdrive Platform accessed through the library website which uses the \"Adobe Digital Editions\" Application provides the needed interface to bring the library onto the Nook Tablet through your home computer.\n\nMy county library system has a Downloadable Library that is powered by Overdrive.com.  Overdrive works with thousands of publishers to distribute eBooks to libraries, schools and retail establishments like B&N.  With the help of the reference librarian at my city library I was able to successfully link to the \"Overdrive\" website through my library's website and then download the \"Adobe Digital Editions\" Application onto my home computer.  The Reference Librarian talked me through parts of the process on the phone. I called twice for help not wanting to tie her up while I went through the registration process.\n\nThis Application is offered free from Adobe.com but does require registration with Adobe to access and download it.  The library eBook editions are then downloaded and stored on the home computer through the \"Adobe Digital Editions\" Application.  The digital book copy can be transfered from the home computer to as many as 4 other digital devices (Adobe allows for this), but each digital device must be authorized before downloading the very first eBook.\n\nThis was a long and overly complicated process it seems to me, and it took close to 2 hours for me to complete all the steps and then download a library book through the library's Downloadable Library site to the \"Adobe Digital Editions\" platform on my computer. I finally was able to transfer the eBook from my computer onto the Nook through the Nook Tablet's USB cable connected to my computer. My husband made sure that we safely disconnected the cable from the computer through a pop-up from the task bar before physically separating the Nook Tablet from the cable connection.\n\nThrough this Adobe application I am able to read the downloaded eBook edition on my computer.  I put an icon on my desktop for quick access the platform. And ... I can read the book on my Nook Tablet as well. Hopefully the next eBook I download from the library will be an easy and swift process since all is now in place for this to occur smoothly and quickly.\n\nI have done this once and it worked perfectly, but downloading an 874 page book swallowed 60% of the Nooks 1 GB of memory that is designated for \"My Files\" on the device.  I await the arrival of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SanDisk-32-GB-microSDHC-Flash-Memory-Card-card-only-SDSDQM-032G/dp/B004G60AD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SanDisk 32 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card (card only) SDSDQM-032G</a>.  There isn't a lot more that can be downloaded onto \"My Files\" without it.\n\nThis is the first device of this sort that we have bought (no cell phone or Ipod or other such devices), so I have few expectations at this point. Downloading library books was of critical importance for me.  I actually like the Nook. I love the Pandora app that comes pre-installed. Beautiful color screen with crisp images. I like that I have web access and can email things I want to read from my main computer to the Nook or download an article from the web and store it in \"My Files\" to read later.\n\nI have another week to decide if this is a keeper.  I'll update this review if there is more to say.  I might change my rating then.  Only 3 stars now because of the already known and often discussed limitations, the expensive apps and the overly complicated library download process.\n\nHope this helps.", "summary": "The Nook Tablet does support library downloads, but enabling it was time consuming.", "unixReviewTime": 1328745600}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "4", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2012", "reviewerID": "A2YIUXJ9AVMSKU", "asin": "1400501466", "reviewerName": "kthanid", "reviewText": "B&N locked the Nook Tablet since beginning of January to remove sideloading of apps and such.

I voided the warranty by doing this, but If I had not been able to unlock it's full potential I would ahve brought it back anyway, so no loss here.

Haab", "reviewText": "I pulled the trigger on three of these on pre-order back in November.  I'd cancelled my order for as many Kindle Fires because I felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the Nook Tablet.  I also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we're a four person family and I drive ... all three were for my wife and kids and not me, and I expected they'd be used on the road a lot.\n\nI think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets (both Kindle and Nook, to be fair) are tied to their respective distributors.  That didn't come as any surprise to me, I fully expected it.  I knew that, without modifying the device (not really acceptable for your average person, if you ask me), I would be stuck with B&N's app store.  What I didn't know was how woefully limited that app store really is; it pales in comparison to Amazon's and doesn't even register when compared to the android marketplace.\n\nMy daughter got hers first (a late birthday present).  For the most part, she was satisfied with it.  I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program).  The first thing to notice is that the B&N app store has a tiny selection of free apps.  The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.\n\nNetflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home (PS3 and a bluray player, both hardwired networking) as long as wifi connection is good.  Her other use was email, and since she hardly gets any, the built in app was OK.\n\nThe other two tablets I purchased were for Christmas for my wife and son, and that's where the problems started.  My wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible... she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn't want to have to delete things three times.  The built in email application absolutely sucks.  You can't even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don't want.  We experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace, which also happened to be a FREE app.  B&N makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace, so this app was not available at all, and the selection was slim for other apps.  Even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with Microsoft Exchange servers apparently doesn't work (and is very expensive for an app).\n\nAs I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&N app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.\n\nMy wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books, and bought several of them.  They all downloaded except one stubborn one.  That book would load just fine on all the other Nooks in our house (the other two Tablets and we have two original Nooks, as well).  I sent an email to technical support and received the usual \"we got your request and will reply as soon as possible\" message, along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests.  That was a week ago and we still have not heard back.  After a few days, though, we physically took the Nook to the store to get help.  Nothing worked; off/on, archive/unarchive, even de and re-registered the device (losing our wifi and email configs in the process).  This book still will not load.\n\nWe finally \"side loaded\" the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?).  After side-loading the book, it has no cover art... more annoyance.  That book still won't download correctly, even after they told us it'd be fixed in 48 hours (that was five days ago).\n\nI am not one to \"root\" products like these (especially since they aren't \"mine,\" as I won't be the one using them).  As the \"guy,\" it seems I'm responsible for all technical support in the house and didn't want to deal with the ramifications (or, frankly, even take the time to run through all those steps to do it).  It's not that I can't, it's that it's a pain in the buttocks and I simply shouldn't have to.  We were not asking for the world, we were asking for a table that had Nook e-reader software and allowed a few other niceties.  I wasn't expecting an iPad for $250, but I was expecting working software and a functional email program.\n\nIt's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big \"n\" button on the Nook).  It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.\n\nHowever, the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me (let's say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere... the other side of the bed).  I am returning all three - luckily B&N has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them, which is very cool of them.  They have not lost me as a customer; I have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy.\n\nI hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try.  If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it.  Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag.  I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&N app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large.  Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the \"tablet\" part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.\n\nI imagine they'll fix glitches with the download problem, too.  I'm not the only person who had a problem, but I think everyone else managed to find a solution (besides side-loading).  Keep in mind I generally know what I'm doing and tried everything, and the \"expert\" at the brick-and-mortar store couldn't fix it, either.  The lady from Glee didn't come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet, either... that was disappointing.\n\nSo that's my review - it's decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content.  Some will argue that it's not meant to be a tablet, it's meant to be an e-reader, but let's be honest - it's marketed as a tablet; it's called the Nook TABLET.

I've got to say, it's nice.  Fonts are small, though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues (google this).  Netflix works, and the UI is really quite nice - pretty much no need for Button Savior, battery life is same as CM7.  In general I like it better than CM7.  My major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes, no BT, no GPS.  Seems to charge fine with a normal cable.\n\nAt this point I lean toward Samsung tablets - I like the IR and the microSD slot.\n\n===========================\nUpdate Jul 2012: I've installed Cyanogen 7, which works with button savior.  I had trouble installing from .zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microSD card.  Fonts are sometimes a bit big, as is line spacing, but in general, CM7 frees you of the B&N walled-ness, even as somewhat mitigated below.  Netflix doesn't work, and Google Chrome won't run on Android 2.3.  Headphone jack a bit intermittent - need to wiggle wire sometimes.\n\n===========================\nOriginal review, Dec. 2011.\n===========================\nFirst I give a summary, followed by the details if U are interested.  I hope people will read reviews here, as, if you say much at all on B&N's site, they don't post your review and don't allow you to modify it so that U can post it!:\n\nA Nook Tablet could be quite good if you only want to:\n-  Read ebooks purchased from B&N\n-  Browse the web on a tablet\n-  Play a small selection of games, having to pay 3-4X normal Android/Apple prices\n\nGet something else or modify it if U want to:\n-  Buy a full selection of games/apps\n-  Pay the same price for a game as U would on an iPhone/iPad, Android Phone buying from either the Android Marketplace or Amazon App Store.\n-  Play music where U can sort by artist, album, genre, etc.\n-  Play mpeg videos\n-  Watch YouTube\n\nIf U are willing to do a bit of work, you can do all this by modifying the device.  I used it rooted with the modifications described below for 11 months, before installing Cyanogen 7.2 on it.  This is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications - it's essentially a normal 7\" Android tablet now.\n\nThe Details:\n============\nMy daughter got a Nook Tablet for Christmas 2011.  She'd been saving for an iPad (~$500) but at the rate she was saving, we took pity after a year and a half.\n\nWhile she does read (and so do us parents), she also wanted to use it as a music player, and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car, on a plane, etc, and she wanted to play some games.\n\nI did my reading and we seriously considered an iPad for the family with each of our 2 kids putting in $150 or so.\n\nI read about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - the Fire only had 8GB of onboard storage at the time, and no micro SD slot.  A deal-breaker.  This was pre Samsung GalaxyTab, Nexus, etc.  Since the Nook Tablet has 16GB and a micro SD slot, we went to a store to take a look.  Sales guy was good, and the device hardware shows well.  Once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup, we found the first of our issues:\n\nIssue #1: Onboard Memory\n========================\nOf the 16GB of storage, you can only place your own items in 1GB.  The rest is for B&N-purchased content.  1GB is not enough for a music collection, or any significant amount of video.  A 32GB Class 4 micro-SD card was also in her stocking, having read about this ahead of time.\n\nOnce she unwrapped it and we set it up (easy enough), annoyance #2 showed itself:\n\nIssue #2: App prices and quantity\n=================================\n2 Examples: Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja.\n-  BN Market: $2.99, $3.95.\n-  Amazon's Android Market: $0.99 (ad-free), with free ad-supported versions available\n-  Android Market, $0.99 for either, plus free, ad-supported versions available.\n-  Apple App Store, $0.99 and $0.99, plus free, ad-supported versions available.\n\nYouTube: free/pre-installed on all Android/Apple phones/tablets I know of, not available on the Nook Tablet, not in the Nook store.\n\nI didn't buy either game, but instead looked back to some of my pre-Christmas reading - U can load Amazon's Appstore without rooting the device, esp. if it's running v1.4.0 of the software.  I got that working and bought $0.99 ad-free Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds.  While I was at it, I side-loaded a few other apps by e-mailing them to myself and web-browsing to get them, and got usb drivers working on an XP laptop so I could sideload via adb over usb.\n\nI wasn't home for Christmas, but I did have my work laptop which has music on it.  I copied some over and began to use the music player....\n\nIssue #3: Built-in Music Player Limitations\n===========================================\nThe built-in music player in Android is decent - has been since Android 1.5 - the first version I used.  U can, generally, sort by artist, album, etc, and the UI has dark backgrounds rather than white.  The Nook built-in music player doesn't allow sort. For this, I didn't want to buy a music player, so I went ahead and rooted the device and installed Honeycomb's (Android 3.0's) music player, which is free.  Also put the standard Android YouTube app on since I could now access the Android Market.  The problem wasn't quite solved, because changes to the SD card (adding files) weren't recognized.  I tried Winamp, Songbird and Android 4.0's music player when ICS came out.  They had the same issue.  TTPod does work - you can manually refresh at any time.  I now run Cyanogen, whose music player (modified stock android to add gesture support) works just fine.  They were aware of tablets when they wrote it.\n\nThis is ironic - B&N had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version, plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen - Cyanogen 7 Android supports gestures for music - do an arrow to the left like \"<\", say, and it'll go back a track.  This would be great while driving.\n\n(Note that U can unroot by putting a copy of 1.4.0 on an SD card which, though I'm not sure, would probably allow you to return the device if U needed to).\n\nIssue #4: Built-in Video Player Limitations\n===========================================\nI'd also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos I nabbed from our TiVos from which I stripped the commercials, saving them as mpg videos.  These wouldn't play with the built-in player.\n\nI solved this with MX Player, free version, which plays them fine. U can do this only if U've installed Amazon's App Store or rooted and can access the Android Market. People out there are selling PC software to convert videos to a format Nook Tablet can use. No need - just get another video player.  MX Player Tip: brightness control is an up/down swipe on the left hand side of the screen, volume on the right.\n\nIssue #5: UI Inflexibility\n==========================\nU can't add shortcuts to the desktop, and can't do much with the sliding apple-style bar either.  For this, I installed App Manager (tough to find a .apk to sideload using adb, so I needed rooting and then got it from Android Market).  This is a fantastic app and I don't use my GoLauncher screen much any more.\n\nAlso, there's one physical button.  Standard android buttons such as menu (right-click) and back aren't always around in the UI, and holding home doesn't bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android.  They should have put those standard 2 buttons on the device.  Update after a month rooted: use Button Savior, which gives soft buttons with a flyout.  Once in a while, you have to use NT Hidden Settings to check USB Debugging unless you use Cyanogen.  Update post Cyanogen: CM7 can have soft buttons (back, menu, home, etc) displayed all the time, if desired, and has Button Savior installed as well.\n\nIssue #6: Can only charge with their charger/cable\n==================================================\nNothing more to say.  BlackBerries and Android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable.  It charge very slowly, even if it doesn't tell you it is, when connected to a PC because or other charger.  With some irony, B&N has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage.  If they could charge with any micro-USB cable, they wouldn't have to.  Update post-Cyanogen: With Cyanogen, it charges with any micro-USB cable, though slowly unless it's the actual Nook stuff - there must be something in hardware.\n\nIssue #7: OTA update breaks all the niceness I've achieved\n==========================================================\nAn OTA update, v1.4.1, will break the ability to mail yourself .apks to be used to enable non-BN apps to install and to enable debugging.  I imagine U could have done these steps while on 1.4.0 and gotten sideloading via PC/adb to work, but U can't disable OTA updates.  U can if you root, though, so I did, then used SQLite to modify a setting to only update when done manually. It'll never auto-update.  Update post-Cyanogen: irrelevant now.\n\nGoodness #1: Hardware is pretty sweet\n=====================================\nSnappy, installs apps fine, opens them quickly, videos are fairly smooth, scrolling is pretty good (but not as nice as Apple's).\n\nScreen is great from angles, clear and bright.\n\nIt's lightweight and can be held easily in one hand.\n\nSpeaker is pretty loud - louder than any of our phones except maybe BlackBerry.\n\nGoodness #2: the Reading Aspect\n===============================\nThe reading end of the device is well-implemented, though I give Amazon's original Kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase UI.  Doing so from the web is also very fast.  A web order using a computer of a B&N sample appeared about an hour later, but quite snappily when done from the device.\n\nGoodness #3: Books with Videos/Sound\n====================================\nYes, these are available on Kindle Fire and iPads. I know. I do like the talking kid's books (reminds me of a LeapFrog Tag pen, but without the ability to touch words and hear them), and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce.  This is good for cooking!  U can see what each stage is supposed to look like.\n\nGoodness #4: Good if U Root it, for $250\n========================================\nWhen rooted, it's a nice tablet + it has the B&N connection, and it cost $250.  It isn't an iPad (no cameras or BT), and it's half the price.  Update Nov 2012: There are now a multitude of 7\" tablets (ASUS, Samsung, Google) which get my recommendation.", "summary": "Very Limited Unless You Modify It", "unixReviewTime": 1325462400}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "4", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2012", "reviewerID": "A1K4H0D2FLQHL2", "asin": "1400501466", "reviewerName": "Neuralsplyce", "reviewText": "Synopsis:  Good ebook reader. Mediocre tablet that is decent for media consumption but is limited at media creation.  Limited Out-of-the-box functionality because it seems to have been designed to require third-party apps. Total Cost of Ownership is $400.\n\nI readily admit I am not the target user Barnes and Noble (B&N) had in mind for the NOOK Tablet.  I spend a lot of time flying for work and my needs were for a supplement to my laptop. Tablets, including the vaunted iPad, are meant for enjoying media (music, video, casual games, reading) and not for editing or creating new content.  The 7\" tablets are even more hampered by their limited screen space.  So why did I choose a 7\" tablet instead of an iPad or 10\" competitor?  Price.  The large tablets start at $600 and after adding peripherals your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is $900 - $1000, which is the same price as a good laptop that does everything...except run on battery for a 6+ hour flight.\n\nAfter a lot of online research, I settled on the NOOK Tablet.  B&N has a 14-day return policy so I put the Tablet through rigorous functionality testing to determine whether to keep it or not.  As much as possible, I only used the built-in applications and made no changes to the hardware or software.  I will not discuss the hardware because you can find dozens of reviews online.  These are my results.\n\nReading books. Naturally, the Tablet excels.  My concern was that it be able to remember bookmarks on multiple books and PDFs even after powering off and/or removing the SD card.  Verdict: PASS\n\nReading magazines.  B&N tells you up front that you have to cancel your emagazine subscriptions and use their web store.  I tried reading PDF versions and online subscriptions through Zinio's website (which supports everything except NOOKs).  There just is no easy way to read multi-column magazine articles on a 7\" tablet.  This is too bad because my second reason to get a tablet was to stop carrying around 15 pounds of magazines.  Verdict: FAIL\n\nReading and editing MS Office Documents and PDFs.  This is 70% of my job and the primary reason for purchasing a tablet.  The Tablet has a lite MS Office reader and a PDF reader.  Both are good at reading documents. Neither allow editing or adding notes to documents.  For about $20 you can buy excellent third-party apps that allow editing both types of documents. (Note: Animations in PowerPoint do not animate so the Tablet is not suitable for showing animated presentations.)  The virtual keyboard is the biggest limitation.  Most internal apps do not support rotation so the keyboard is not much wider than a smartphone keyboard.  You have to type with your index fingers to keep from hitting numerous keys.  Where the keyboard totally fails is a lack of cursor keys.  If you have a typo in the middle of word, there is no way to move the cursor to the exact letter you want it on.  Retyping entire words is not uncommon.  Verdict: FAIL\n\nEmail.  The Tablet has email capabilities and works really well with GMAIL accounts.  However, security is appalling.  Once your enter your account and password you are never prompted for it again.  This means if someone picks up your Tablet they can read your email.  The settings can be changed to require a password to compose email, but it does not appear to work.  Enabling the 4 number passcode on the Tablet is the only security you have.  Because of this, I have not tried connecting to my work MS Exchange server and probably never will.  Verdict: FAIL\n\nWeb Browsing.  The Tablet has a good web browser that supports Flash Video, which means you can watch YouTube videos.  You can keep bookmarks and open HTML pages stored on the media card. The primary browsing limitations are the screen size (and obviously need for a wireless connection).  Verdict: PASS\n\nCalendar and To-Dos.  There are no built-in apps for either of these, which seems unthinkable.  Even a basic smartphone has these.  You can download free ones from the B&N app store.  Verdict: FAIL\n\nNote Taking.  No built-in app for writing notes!  The Tablet has a microphone, but you can't even create audio notes.  Note taking is the one killer app I wanted for home use.  I write notes everywhere to the point of being buried by them.  Third-party apps saves the day.  Evernote works great with the Tablet - and supports audio notes and keyboard rotation.  Verdict: FAIL\n\nMusic.  The music player is absolute garbage and there is currently no third-party alternative.  The first week the music player would skip a lot and even crash the Tablet when playing MP3s from the SD card.  Recovery was horrible because the Tablet wouldn't shut down and then wouldn't power up without being connected to the power cord.  Fortunately, a firmware update solved the instability problem.  Despite four ways of sorting music, finding and playing music in the order you want is terrible (see comments on audiobooks).  You can pause and resume a song but you cannot stop.  There is no stop button.  The speaker on the Tablet is lousy.  My two-year old Blackberry phone has a better speaker and it's 1/3rd the size of the Tablet.  The speaker is very loud though so will fill a hotel room with mediocre sound.  Surprisingly, the speaker sounds no worse even though covered up when the Tablet is in a carrying case.  Verdict: FAIL\n\nAudiobooks.  You would think an ebook reader would also have good support for audiobooks.  The internal memory and media card have folders for specific media types.  You can even create your own folders on the SD card.  However, no matter where you put your media, the Tablet finds all of it and dumps it into either the music player or the media player.  There is no way to separate audiobooks from music.  Where the music player completely fails is playing audiobooks in sequential order.  Most software applications sort by reading a filename from left to right and sorting on the first character difference it finds.  The music player apparently looks at the first few characters and then the last characters and ignores the middle ones.  For example, an audiobook with multiple discs and chapters should sort by discs first (1, 2, 3) and then by chapter (1,2,3).  Instead the Tablet sorts by placing all the chapter ones together and then all the chapter twos and so one.  The file manager sorts alphabetically so you have to open the media card file manager and play audiobooks from there. Verdict: FAIL\n\nPictures.  The Tablet is a pretty good electronic photo album with all the pinch-and-zoom features you expect.  However, like the music player, there's no way to segregate pictures into albums.  I loaded a document with a ton of embedded images and they ended up in the media gallery as well.  You can delete images from the gallery...except the sample pictures for some reason. Verdict: PASS (but hoping for a feature update or third-party alternative soon)\n\nVideo.  NetFlix and Hulu work good over a wireless connection, but you may get lower resolutions due to the bandwidth limits of a wireless connection.  Playing stored video files requires using the media player. Even though the web browser supports Flash video, the media player does not.  As long as you convert your videos to .m4v format, you can put anything on the Tablet (Handbrake or RealPlayer is perfect for converting video on a PC/Mac).  The image quality is great, although I seem to notice a slight flicker in converted Flash videos like they are playing at 28 frames per second rather than 30.  The media player does not support scene selection/jumping to chapters in movies and has no bookmarking feature.  Unlike the music player which will play in the background, you cannot multitask.  If you leave the media player to use another app, your video will stop.  Unfortunately, videos get lumped into the media gallery with photos and the thumbnail appears to be a random still image from 1 minute into the video.  Verdict: PASS (it's a book reader, not a movie player)\n\nTotal Cost of Ownership.  Currently, the Tablet costs $250.  For something designed to be used on the road, you will need an extra power supply ($25) and protective cover case ($35).  The $50 extended warranty is a requirement since the Tablet will probably be dropped and crushed frequently.  To install more than a few books, documents, and media files will require an SD card ($20 - $35).  Add another $30 to purchase third-party apps to add functionality and you have around $400 invested in the Tablet.  Purchasing ebooks and emagazines is an optional ongoing expense.\n\nFinal Verdict.  As much as I tried to only use built-in apps during the trial period, when I could not get the functionality I wanted from them I was able to download a number of free or inexpensive apps.  These allow me to do the basic content creation and editing I need on the road. A B&N employee flat out admitted the Tablet was rushed out the door with only NOOK Color functionality so was not being fully exploited yet.  The firmware update proved B&N is committed to making the Tablet live up to its promise. Realizing that no tablet can yet replace a laptop, and the functionality and ubiquity Evernote brings, convinced me to keep the Tablet.", "summary": "Good ebook reader.  Mediocre tablet", "unixReviewTime": 1325376000}, {"overall": 2.0, "vote": "162", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2011", "reviewerID": "A7YI49J8WC8XL", "asin": "1400501466", "reviewerName": "Phil O", "reviewText": "I bought a Nook Tablet based on the principle that it was much more than an eReader and was backed by an upstanding company in Barnes & Noble.\n\nAt the price point the hardware is truly magnificent with a wonderful screen, fast processor, good storage capacity and an SD card. I didn't need the GPS and cameras that are 'missing'. The 7\" form factor turned out to be ideal for my purposes.\n\nThe selection of eBooks from Barnes & Noble is excellent and even the magazines I bought are more than readable. Netflix video quality, while not High Definition, is certainly High Quality and is simply stunning with the right movie and since I am a Netflix streaming subscriber already, was 'free' to me. So far so good.\n\nHere's the rub. The selection of apps from B&N is truly pitiful. I mean, worse than you can imagine. Now combine this with the fact that the standard email client as installed on the NT is very basic and limited and the standard web browser is little better. There are no replacements in the app store. None. What you see is what you get.\n\nAnd something else makes it even worse. You can't add your Google accounts in order to sync with Google services such as contacts, calendar, reader etc.\n\nThe sad thing is the hardware is MORE THAN capable of running all these services but is being prevented from doing so by the B&N tablet software and their 'walled garden' approach - similar to that adopted by Apple but without their huge app store and connected services to create the illusion that you are not in an ecosystem prison.\n\nThere were originally two ways that NT owners could enhance the tablet but B&N are now attempting to close both of these paths with their latest operating system 'upgrade' (version 1.4.1) that is automatically installed on your Nook Tablet when you connect to the internet. They issued this 'bug fix' release on December 23rd. Bah humbug is right.\n\n1. 'Sideloading' of applications was possible on version 1.4.0 and this let you install applications from sources other than B&N's paltry selection. So, for instance, you could install Dolphin Browser for tabbed web browsing and gesture input or Skitmail for a real email experience. Now that's all gone and you get no option to add apps that B&N don't have - which is most of them.  My guess is that for most users, sideloading would have resolved the issue of the inadequate B&N app store. had they been smart, B&N would have delayed implementing the blocking until they could dramatically increase their selection of apps.\n\n2. 'Rooting' the tablet is a way to bypass the B&N controls and open up the tablet to the full Android experience which not only means access to the Google market and Google apps but also to 'superuser'  functions to enable enhanced control of the operating system. This is not for novices and requires some technical understanding of the Android operating system so likely only a very small number of advanced users would ever attempt this. B&N have attempted to block this too. Really? What exactly is the point B&N?\n\nSo, what we have here is a truly excellent piece of hardware with a fantastic eReader infrastructure capable of doing so much more than it is permitted to do by Barnes & Noble. Their motivation is to force users to buy only from them - which as Apple have proved - is perfectly okay if you make the selection big enough. Problem is, the selection is totally, hopelessly, unbelievably inadequate. Barnes & Noble will still have a huge hit on it's hands because many people have relatively simple needs. The pity is it could have been a massive home run in their battle to stay alive in the space they compete for with Amazon.\n\nSo what to do? With a heavy heart I will likely return my gorgeous Nook Tablet and spend just a little more for a real 7\" tablet upon which I will install a Nook app and be very happy. I simply don't have the time, patience or inclination to fight a company that has proven it just doesn't 'get it'.\n\nKnow what you are getting into before you buy.", "summary": "Superb hardware crippled by restrictive software", "unixReviewTime": 1325116800}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "10", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2011", "reviewerID": "A24FWCMHHS50RF", "asin": "1400501466", "reviewerName": "V.

I really like the fact that you can preorder ebooks which will just download to your device when they are available.  I like the fact that the power cord is $14.99 so I can buy extra (one for home, one for work) - where Sony Reader's power cord was almost $30.00.  I like the fact that I can install my own new battery when the time comes and not have to send my reader off to have it done for me.

(I have a teeny tiny little hoarder of books inside of me!) But then I finally caved and decided to try one because of my difficulty in reading larger and heavier books laying in bed at night, and due to being away from home for periods of time where I couldn't easily carry a dozen books with me.\nThe first reader I had experience with was when my grandpa had purchased one of those huge honkin' Kindle DS readers with the full key pad. I was excited about that one, but the price was WAY out of range. I decided to try and go with the Nook (after my typical pre-purchase ritual of spending days doing research on the best option) and I was so thrilled with it, I had nothing bad to say. I used that little beauty for a few good years, until I was forced to sell it to help pay bills. From the very moment the Nook left my hands I regretted it. I was certain I'd never find one that good again. And I don't believe there has been any readers since then that are that good still!\nFast-forward to this Black Friday. The FIRST Black Friday when I actually HAVE some money to spend! And I am looking for a really good e-reader! I did come across the Nook on Amazon, and saw the new Nook Simple Touch, which intrigued me, because I wanted to stick with the e-ink display, and not have a full-size touch screen battery killer. Finally, I realized my love for the original Nook had never died, and it still had everything I could ever want in an e-book reader. I was even able to buy one from a vendor here on Amazon, who lived less than half an hour away from me, and it only cost me $50!!! I was SOOOOO excited!!\nNow, if only I had NOT wasted $5 on that stupid fake-leather black cover, that completely RUINED the casing on my Nook... :(", "summary": "After All These 'Cutting Edge' E-Readers...", "unixReviewTime": 1354665600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2012", "reviewerID": "A2V24K8UWPPDSB", "asin": "1400532620", "reviewerName": "ashley Robinson", "reviewText": "This tablet from barnes and noble is an afforadable alternative to the ipad.

I've also spent dozens of hours on the telephone with Nook support and other activities related to keeping it running.  I'm an experienced software designed/programmer, engineer, etc. and I can assure you that compared to a paper book, this is a seriously flawed concept.  If you insist on buying an eBook reader, make sure you allocate plenty of time that you could have better spent on reading a real book to spend on arguing on the telephone with foreign call center reps.  B&N's concept of customer support is severely lacking and they appear to have little knowledge when it comes to supporting electronic gear.\n\nOn top of those problems, consider the very concept of the electronic book.  While you will pay close to the same price you'd pay for a real book on sale, you won't own the book - you'll have a license to use it.  When you're finished with the book, maybe you'd like to be able to loan it to a relative or friend, but you can only do that if they have a Nook and you can loan it for two weeks only.  I suppose when the two weeks is up, the borrower sees the book disappear, finished or not.\n\nAnd then there's the odd problem of your Nook for some reason being tied closely to the email address you had on file with B&N when you registered your Nook.  I recently had to change my email address and updated my B&N account with the new address and new B&N password.  After that, I could no longer download books, and was unable to unregister and register my Nook (that was supposed to fix the problem, according to the support center).  If you happen to get yourself into that dilemma, be ready for a long drawn-out session on the telephone.  The problem was that B&N neglected to spell this situation out on their website when I changed my email address.\n\nSo, if you're into \"going green\", driving a hybrid car (and thinking it's going to save you money in the long run), then the Nook may be for you.

At the current price, I think it's a good deal but I'm not sure it would be my choice if I could roll back time.  I originally purchased this because I wanted to rent ebooks from the Library and that wasn't an option with the Kindle.  Now, they come for the Kindle as well as in epub and pdf formats.  You can basically use any ereader to rent these now.\n\nI read all these reviews saying that the black and white was like paper, easiest to read.  It's not anything like a paper book, it's far less \"bright\" when it comes to reading.  Don't get me wrong, I love ebooks.  I haven't read a paper book in a year.  It is just that even in regular light it is not as easy to see for me.  You absolutely can read it without a light during the day, but it is not nearly as crisp or easy as it would be with a paper book.  I have a clip on light, and with that it's perfect at night.  I'm able to read in bed and not disturb my husband, if one wants a black and white reader as close to paper as you can get--I'm just not sure this is what one would expect.\n\nThis reader has a browser which you can use to get on the internet.  It was handy when we were in a hotel with wifi and I didn't bring the laptop and I needed to know when a business opened.  It's certainly not easy to surf, this would not be my choice to use unless in a pinch.\n\nThe battery does not last as long as I expected.  I get maybe a week and a half out of it, if I turn it completely off when not using it--and if I have it on airplane mode (not wifi enabled).  I do read at least a few hours a day.  The time is much shorter if I let it just hibernate.\n\nI am not sure if the text size options are specific to the device or the book.  It appears to me it is the device that offers limited options, though it varies based on the originating text of the book. The text size on extra large--the largest option-- is often (it varies by book) small enough that it would equal that of a normal book.  My vision is pretty good and occasionally I'm annoyed by how small extra large is.  In some books medium is the same as extra large in others.  I do think that for anyone with vision challenges, limited text size might be an issue.\n\nObtaining books is easy to do through Barnes and Noble.  You need to go online on a computer and provide a credit card.  You can then order them on the computer, or through your device.  I generally use the computer, but if you know what you want--ordering directly from the Nook is quick and easy.  Transferring library rentals is also as easy as drag and drop, using Adobe Digital Solutions (free app, the library should have a link to download it).\n\nAll in all, it's a good ereader.

I would constantly diss the e-readers claiming that books were soooo much better. Then I ordered a book series from Amazon and the books/print was so tiny that I could barely read them without straining my eyes and driving myself crazy. My mom (<3!!) gave me my brothers old nook since he had a new nook color so I could download and read the series on this. It wasn't cheap to download the books, but compared to reading the free versions a friend had sent me (which were horrible because the text was all messed up...typos galore) but the option to make the text larger or smaller and the clarity of the screen made the 8+ dollars per book soooo worth the price.\n\nThe battery on this lasts so long it's insane. I would read daily maybe 5 hours per day over the summer (hey, I had to finish the series before school resumed!) and I only had to charge it once a week tops, even then the battery wasn't drained I just didn't want to give it a chance to run out. I am so in love with my nook now it's insane. I can download almost any book I could possibly need and carry it around in this tiny little, lightweight nook.\n\nAnother big plus....MY BOOKMARKS DON'T FALL OUT OF THE NOOK!! Nothing is more frustrating than losing your place and going bananas trying to find it without revealing something you haven't read yet.\n\nAlso, when it comes to textbooks this is a lifesaver!!

Haven't been back to the library since!\n\nNow here comes the Nook Simple Touch (Nook ST) ereader. It is just now starting to show up in B&N stores (not on Amazon yet). I was lucky enough to find a store near me that had one that was not spoken for yet. I bought it yesterday and have been busy trying it out. It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook ST, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the \"slide to unlock\" feature like the iPhone.  The touchscreen on the Nook ST is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine.  I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.\n\nI returned the original Nook since the Nook ST is so much better. Note that the Nook ST doesn't have 3G connectivity, a web browser, or an MP3 player. If you want all that, buy the original Nook. If you don't require all of these features and would like a basic e-reader with an intuitive touch screen interface, then take a look at the Nook ST.\n\nThe Nook ST is just beginning to become available (only at B&N right now), but I suspect that Amazon and other high quality retailers will be selling it very soon.\n\nHere's another plus for the Nook (whether it is the original one or the ST).  The Kindle has a proprietary ebook format that limits your options in purchasing and reading ebooks.

Being electronically challenged, she immediately plopped it in my lap with instructions to \"Buy me a book\". As the nearest B&N store is 30 miles away I elected to follow the B&N site to my PC, to the Nook route.  Opening an account on the B&N site, purchasing a book and downloading it to my PC was easy and fast. Prices are about half that of a printed version. Passing it along to the Nook was another matter.  The Nook came with virtually no usable instructions, either printed or electronic, to explain the procedure that I wanted to use.  After going back to the B&N site I discovered a little free program called \"Nook for PC\". After downloading that program I was able to copy the book from my PC to the Nook. Everything works fine now, and my wife is addicted to the thing, she takes it everywhere. She still will not, however, try to load new purchases on the Nook.\n\nWe now have three copies of every book we have purchased, one on the B&N site, one on my computer, and one on the Nook. With one Nook, it is pretty hard to share after she finishes, and although I can read the books on my PC, that just is not comfortable or practical.  I personally think $150 or so for my own Nook might be a little too much so I am going to look into a cheaper alternative. Walmart has one or two for under $120, one for under $90 that some people like.\n\nThe Nook is a good option if all you want is a book reader.  The other functions do not seem to work well enough to be practical. The Nook might be a little expensive for what you get, but the service at the B&N store we visited twice was excellent.  One evening after dinner we visited a B&N store with Nook in tow. After my wife found a book she wanted, we took the book and the Nook to the Nook counter.  The attendant was happy to purchase the book with her Nook and download it for her.  The book cost for $24 and change, downloaded to the Nook, $12 and change. He even offered to return the book to the proper place on the shelf.

I love that it can be updated without much effort and the library management system that barnes and noble uses is quite good.\n\nHonestly this device has all the pros of a kindle with one major upside. The ability to load documents and free ebooks far far far exceeds the kindle. My great aunt wrote a novel before she passed away and had a microsoft word document copy. With the help of some free software, I was able to convert the file and load it onto my nook in a matter of minutes! My sister has a kindle and could not figure out a way to load it onto her device.

Owen", "reviewText": "I asked for this e-reader for Christmas due to seeing it in a Barnes and Noble store and learning about its features. It  offers greater compatibility with different ebook formats than the Kindle (particularly the EPUB format), has access to special offers when you're inside a Barnes and Noble store, and permits you to lend books to other Nook users. There's also a little color LCD touch screen at the bottom for accessing menu options.\n\nPersonally, I haven't taken advantage of most of the Nook's features yet, but I do like what I see so far. The touchscreen adds a great deal of versatility to the device and I'd say it's easier to access menu options this way than with just one e-ink screen and some buttons. I also appreciate the ability to upgrade the memory with a microSD card, but I would have preferred to do so without opening the device. Also, if you have a problem with the Nook, you shouldn't have a problem getting a replacement. I, er, damaged my first Nook through, shall we say, \"user error,\" but B&N staff was happy to provide a new one for me.\n\nIt's not quite perfect, though. It's kind of heavy, for one thing. The touchscreen is a bit slow to respond and can significantly drain the battery, for another. And, some of the Nook's buttons seem to be a little too stiff. I prefer soft, clicky buttons, you know? Maybe in its next iteration the Nook will have proper buttons instead of this \"bendy plastic\" business.\n\nAnyway, which e-reader you get largely boils down to your personal preferences, and which retailer's online library you'd rather have access to. For my part, I think the Nook satisfies all of my needs just fine. Be careful where you buy it from, though. $180, which is the price it's selling for on Amazon right now, is way too much when you can just walk into a brick and mortar store and get it for thirty bucks less.", "summary": "An excellent e-reader", "unixReviewTime": 1295481600}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "11", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2011", "reviewerID": "A20Y7REXQZ1REW", "asin": "1400532620", "reviewerName": "Ryan Kurtz", "reviewText": "First off, I want to start out by saying that I love my Nook. My friend is an employee of B&N so he was there to help guide me along in my selection and answer any questions I had. So, yes, I did have a little bias to the product to begin with. However, for what I need, this is perfect in almost every single way. In my review I'll compare the Nook to the Kindle ($139 version) and it's major differences, just so people know what I'm talking about in terms of other products as we go down the list.\n\nThe Bad (If you want to call it that):\n\n1. The Nook is a little heavier than the Kindle. I'm not sure of the exact weight differences, but just by feel alone it is a tad bit heavier. Now, that can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. I for one don't find it to be a deal buster, the weight is not catastrophically heavier and uncomfortable, but it is heavier than the Kindle. I do think, however, that the durability of the Nook is a little better compared to the Kindle. The Nook has built in paddles to turn the pages, while the Kindle has flappy paddles along the side that feel as though they could break if I dropped it on it's side or if I touched it to hard. My suggestion for anyone interested in buying the Nook is to also buy a carrying case for it so it makes it easier to read, almost as if you were reading a real book. The covers at B&N usually start around $30.\n\n2. The Nook does have a touch screen that has a bit of glare to it. Some others have posted their reviews of how they dislike the glare when the touch screen goes dark. For me it is a bit distracting if you find yourself wandering away from the text. However, whenever I read a book I find many distractions around me while I read. It's not a huge deal in anyway and some have posted if you turn it to the right angle you won't see your reflection. Again, not a deal buster in anyway I wouldn't think.\n\n3. The start up time is atrocious. I can't defend this one in anyway. Amish people can put up houses in a faster amount of time before the Nook would have a chance to get to your homepage. Ok, so not quite that slow, but you get the idea. I haven't timed it yet but I'm going to take an educated guess that it takes around 1-1/2 minutes to start up. That is something that should have been addressed from B&N to begin with. Again, I can't defend this one in anyway.\n\nOk, so what you have all been waiting for: The Good\n\n1. The extra storage feature is superb. The Nook comes with a built in 2GB storage space. Enough for most people, 2GB will get most every book you want to read in your Nook with no problem. However, if you are a fanatic reader that has Newspapers and Magazines delivered to your Nook everyday or every week, this can begin to take up space if you don't free it up. But don't fret! The Nook comes with an extra storage slot for your SD card that can hold up to whatever the highest SD card space is out there. The great thing about it is, SD cards are a lot cheaper today than you would have found 3 years ago, so adding space is cheap.\n\n2. The Nook has a featured called \"LendMe\". This is something that the Kindle does not have and I'm sure for competition sake will have in the future. This a great, great, great feature to the Nook! If you have any friends, family or co-workers that have a Nook and have a book on theirs that you would like to read, you can hook up wireless or through the computer and Lend them a copy of it for up to 14 days. If you're a fast reader then you can knock out a 500-600 page book in easily 14 days.\n\n3. Your county library might be on the list of Nook rentals. In the county in which I reside in North Carolina, our county library is fortunate enough to have a system in which I can rent books for 14 days from the library. This also is something the Kindle does not have. Before I go off on how great the feature for renting books is, I should point out that the library is going to have a limited selection of books for you to rent. I'm a big Thomas Sowell reader and he has approximately 30 books out on the market. However, the county library that I rent from has only 1 book from his selection. So do you're research before you buy a book, your county library might have it already. The feature, as I have seen, is relatively easy to use. You do have to hard wire your Nook to your computer after you download some software, but it's really simple and the kind people at your local county library can assist you on how to do this. In fact our county library had everything we needed in terms of software and directions on their website.\n\n4. Finally. You can take your Nook to B&N and read any book for up to an hour. Recently I went to grab some coffee at B&N and wanted to read a book on Ireland. Popped open my Nook, connected to the B&N network (already programmed into your nook for ease), selected the book I wanted to read from the list I searched on, and wam-bam I was reading a book. You can read lots of books on one Nook from their online selection without having to lug 20 actual books that you wanted to compare before you bought.\n\nIn closing on this review I would say first and foremost do your homework. Go to B&N or BestBuy and try out the Kindle, Nook and even the Sony Reader. Some will really like the touch screen of the Nook compared to the touchpad of the Kindle, but it's all in what you like. Some will like the fact you can Lend books and some won't.\n\nI'm sure I've missed out on something that others would like to know about the product before buying, so if you have any questions please contact me back here on Amazon and I'll try to get to you as quickly as possible.", "summary": "Great Item, But Does Have a Few Flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1293926400}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "7", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2010", "reviewerID": "A89ZZKNDFQH23", "asin": "1400532620", "reviewerName": "Delaney", "reviewText": "I have been eyeballing e-readers for a while and I was absolutely certain that I was going to purchase a Kindle.  Well many moons ago I worked at Barnes and Noble and stopped in to visit and old friend.  He introduced me to the Nook, I shrugged up my nose and said, 'Yeah, I'm sold on the Kindle.'\nAfter playing around with the Nook, I really found myself enamored of it.  I like the touch screen.  I like that the battery replacement if necessary is something the consumer can do.  I liked that you could share your nook books with others.  On the Nook that I have -and I did purchase a refurbished Nook - games included are suduko and chess.  The daily is a feature that automatically downloads articles specifically for the Nook users.  The library is where you can store all of your books and create shelves for your titles and organize the titles.  Shopping is a breeze, either directly on the nook or online.  You will need a card, be it debit or credit to purchase the books, you can use gift cards, but I believe that you need to have a card on file.\nI can store and listen to music on my Nook, I can access the internet (mine is WiFi) and use it to search and answer email or update facebook.\nIn short, I'm madly in love with it.  I have not had any problems with it.

Archiving titles would allow you to free up space on your Nook.\n\nRecommendations, I have a silicone slip cover to protect my Nook if I drop it, I also have a slightly hardcover case to protect the Nook when it is in my purse, I do have a book light as the screens are not backlit to avoid glare.\n\nThe only downside, some fools will think your screen is paper and they will touch it in awe and smudge up your reading screen.", "summary": "I really love this", "unixReviewTime": 1293667200}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "8", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2010", "reviewerID": "A2OKCS5234ZV7S", "asin": "1400532620", "reviewerName": "Flower", "reviewText": "First let me say that when the Nook first came out on the market it caught my eye. I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.\nThen the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...\n\nWell The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.\n\nRight out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.\n\nI also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...\n\nNow with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!\n\nI have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.\n\nNow with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!\n\nWhat a great gift, and a great buy!!!\n\n**************Update****************\n5/30/2011\nThe Nook is still awesome... Since I have owned the Nook for a while now, I came back to offer an update..\nAs far as downloading books, I downloaded books the other day and before I could blink they were on my Nook!\nI am still happy with my Nook and love my Nook! I have recommended the Nook to friends and family who have also made purchases and are happy with the Nook as well.\nThe performance of my Nook is awesome, and I have had great experiences with my Nook since the day I was surprised with the Nook as a gift! Best gift anyone can give! The joy of reading!\n\nI take my Nook with me every where! My children are still in love with my Nook and love to play the games on my Nook or read a book. My husband even likes for the children to read books on the Nook. The Nook has brought so much fun and the joy of reading to our family!\n\nYou can also go to Barnes and Nobles and take classes to learn more about your Nook as there is so much to learn and so much that the Nook has to offer. Check in your area to see what times your local Barnes and Nobles offers classes.\n\nI also like the Nook because the Nook continues to educate you on a daily basis with the daily blog of what took place on the days of the week, for example if you turn on your Nook right now and go to the daily, it will inform you what took place on this date. Which to me is a neat feature as you get to learn something new about something you may have  not known.\n\nAs far as the touch screen part of the Nook, we love it! It does not distract us but adds to the beauty of the Nook in our opinion. It is easy for my family to use.\n\n********2012 Update*****\nWell it is 4/24/2012 and I still love my Nook and my Nook still works great! I just wanted to give another update for individuals looking for a e reader.\nAs of this date, our children are now asking as they did before can they have my Nook. And for now they can use my Nook, but I still love Nook and I am not ready to give my Nook up. One day we will purchase Nooks for the whole family.\n\nAs far as use, I was out in the sun and reading with no problem. So many e reads and tablets are currently on the market. This nook still works for me and still performs and amazes me. There is still so much to learn with the Nook I currently own. If you are looking for a great affordable e reader. Don't over look Nook.  Good luck with your decision.\n\nHopefully this update will help you in your decision. We would by one hundred more and pass them out as gifts and charity, just so people can get to read and find joy in reading! Great tool to use to educate children and adults!\n\nBack to my Nook!", "summary": "Great E-Reader 2012 and Nook Still Rocks!", "unixReviewTime": 1293580800}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "3", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2010", "reviewerID": "AQGUDK0MSQ95L", "asin": "1400532620", "reviewerName": "ibuythings", "reviewText": "If anyone have used previous version of nook you will immediately see the improvements on new version of nook. One of the most important feature I found on the new nook was better page turn response. The screen refresh when moving from page to page is much quicker, nearly matching the refresh rates of the latest Kindle. The Nook also added a laundry list of interface and usability improvements, such as the ability to organize your book collection by category which is called \"shelves\".I liked 600 X 800 display screen. It comes with 16 shades of gray and is easy to your eyes. I can read all day without hurting my eyes.

The third-generation Amazon Kindle is lighter, thinner, and simply feels a little better to hold in your hand. It also offers double the battery life, more internal memory (4GB versus 2GB). But the new upgrades has given some new features to nook that are not available in kindle. Nook should definitely remain under consideration when you're shopping for e-ink e-book readers. The decision may come down to a personal preference, such as how you feel about the color navigation screen versus the hard keyboard found on the Kindle.\n\nIf my review did not answer any questions, leave a comment below and I will try my best to answer your question.", "summary": "Worthy wifi e-reader for everday reader.", "unixReviewTime": 1293321600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "9", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2010", "reviewerID": "AOY9SZTMNQWAW", "asin": "1400532620", "reviewerName": "Mercedes", "reviewText": "I received the Nook as a Christmas present.  I already own a Kindle latest generations, 3g/wifi.  However I soon discovered that not all books are available on the Kindle and 99.9% of the books I couldn't get on my Kindle are on Nook.  After much research I soon learned that if you want good ebook reader you buy either a Kindle or a Nook.  So I asked Santa for it.\n\nI will not tell you I like the Nook better than my Kindle or my Kindle better than my Nook.  Both have excellent features that make them both excellent ereaders.\nHere's a few on the Nook:  1- It keeps the book title, time, and battery charge visible while reading.  2-It starts up just a bit faster than the Kindle.  3-You can use your own photos for the screen saver and wallpaper.  4-it recognizes the table of contents in PDF books.  5-it reads EPUB file types (meaning you can buy books from Borders.com too and read them)\nAs for the Kindle here are a few features I love about it:  1-I like the real keyboard as the buttons are much easier to push than on screen.  2-It reads PDFS much better than the Nook, more so when you have the PDF converted.  3-the page turns are a bit faster.  4-I prefer the black housing to white.  5-the reading page/screen has no glare at all (the Nook's little color panel on the bottom is very reflective) and it seems the print is a little darker.\nBoth the Nook and Kindle are very easy to purchase and load books on.  I think the thing I was most disappointed in with the Nook are the covers.  They are not enough covers that actually close, like the Kindle and when sticking this reader into your purse or bag, you don't want the cover to open and scratch the screen/reading surface.\nIf you are looking for a great ereader, you cannot go wrong with this Nook or the Kindle latest generation, in my book they are both on the top shelf.  Now if we could just get one that is a smashed together version of both their great features into one unit.\n\nUpdate:  After using both my Nook and Kindle for a while now I've decided I do like the Kindle much better than the Nook.  The page turning buttons on the Kindle are very very light touch, the reading screen does have darker print, and the collections feature is top notch.  Now my Nook, the buttons take some pushing to turn the pages, the reading screen is lighter, and the shelves option is ok.  What I don't care for in the shelves feature is I can't colapse the shelves to just show the shelves and then open them when I want to search in them.  I also don't care for the B&N Library being seperate from My Documents.  On the Kindle these are all included together and you can sort them out using collections.  With the Nook you must use the naviation screen to switch between them.  I've also had some trouble with the navigation screen on the bottom.  I don't have large fingers and don't wear long fingernails so moving around on the screen should be easy.  However, when I'm tryting to scroll or select something on the touch screen I just can't seem to get what I want.  But when I don't mean to move on the touch screen but accidently touch it, I trigger a menu move.  It's still a very good reader, but when comparing options and usability, I'd choose the Kindle any day over the Nook.  I'll purchase most of my books on the Kindle and what isn't Kindlized will go on the Nook.", "summary": "Excellent reader", "unixReviewTime": 1293321600}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "7", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2010", "reviewerID": "AMGGZCWY3VNZC", "asin": "1400532620", "reviewerName": "S. Morales", "reviewText": "With these new ereaders on the market, the act of reading has come back to be a very \"in-style,\" technologically advanced and hip thing to do in 2010. Books are now less intimidating and more fun and convenient, and this becomes only more encouraged through Barnes and Noble's Nook.\nNow, to cut to the chase, the Nook can do most things that the Amazon Kindle can do as well, and while the Kindle holds some ground over the Nook, on an overall scale, if you're looking for a better and more convenient ereader, I'd say to go for the Nook.\nBoth the Kindle and Nook have clear displays, but overall, I would say that the Kindle's display seems to have better resolution. The Kindle also beats the Nook on battery life (as you'll notice that the Nooks battery life seems to last about a week, whereas the Kindle about a month, this is due to the draining power of the Nook's light-up touch screen menu). People may also prefer the button keyboard operation of the Kindle over the Nooks sometimes annoyingly sensitive or not-sensitive-enough touch screen. The Kindle is also thinner and lighter than the Nook. Both have mp3 features though, which helps them. It's always great to be able to read to your favorite music.\nNow, while it may seem in this paragraph the Kindle has the Nook easily beaten, one must look deeper into finding out why the Nook is a better choice. The reason the nook beats the Kindle is easy - in its navigation, presentation and overall ease of use.\n\nThe biggest problem with the Kindle (that I noticed) is that the Kindle seems to want to have the look and feel of navigating like a laptop computer in the way it presents the main menu and font size, style and book selection. The problem with this is one thing - this is NOT a computer, it's a portable book, and Barnes and Noble knows this, and made their unit feel way less like just another annoying technological gadget but instead with a \"browsing bookstore\" type of presentation. This is a very BIG difference between the two, and you can sense it even after just a few minutes of toying with it. And this is only talking about the OLDER Nook, I can only imagine how much more amazing of a presentation the color Nook can get with all of its full color pictures and extras.\nOn top of this, the Kindle seems to have placed the turn-page buttons way too attached to the ends, so you actually end up hitting the buttons by accident way too often, whereas the Nooks buttons are more of a soft \"bendable plastic\" type, so you never hit them by accident. This, on top of the little things like being able to slide your finger on the touch screen to turn pages as well as getting book covers and previews, daily logs, etc, give the nook an overall more \"coffee house\" feel which the Kindle doesn't even come close to. And even though the Nook is bulkier and heavier, it actually is made of a more durable softer rubber-like material, and along with the white paneling it makes it feel overall way more professional and studious. Not to mention just more attractive and stylish. This is easily the hipper of the two ereaders. Therefore, things like slightly longer load times, heavier feel, sometimes annoying touch screen and slightly higher price are actually very tolerable once you pick up both units and see and feel the overall difference.\n\nBooks are an old-fashioned type of entertainment, and while the Kindle tries to make reading and literature just another tacked on 21st century technological piece of unrelatable modernized hardware, the Nook walks the perfect line of bringing the \"old-fashioned\" hobby of reading to a hipper style for the 21st century without taking away the studious professionalism of reading or disrespect the art of literature either.

I was an English major in college and I read tons of books so for a long time I went back and forth between the kindle and the nook. I love amazon, but the nook appealed to me more. I finally bought the nook just after I graduated because I had some leftover graduation money and I am so glad I did. The only thing I might have done differently would be to have paid the extra fifty dollars for the free 3g. I don't really use the web browser, but it would be nice to have since I don't get web on my phone. Anyway, the browser is actually not that bad, if you view a regular web page you have to pan side to side to see the whole thing, so for emails I just use the mobile version of yahoo and gmail since I just have to scroll up and down. The browser works well for basics, like email, checking movie times, and a quick wikipedia search.\n\nThe nook really isn't any heavier than most books (except maybe mass market paperbacks) and I find it to be very comfortable to hold (though usually I prefer holding it with a cover on so it's more like a book). I love the way the books can be organized in different categories. Usually I just organize them by date last opened though since I read more than one book at a time and can therefore have all the books I'm reading at the top of the list. I also love the touch screen it's not perfect (iPod touch and iPhone touch screens are much better), but I don't mind. The games that are included are absolutely perfect for me too. I love chess and sudoku and hopefully they'll add more in the future to be downloaded, but I'm happy with just those two. The screens contrast is great and while the new Kindle says it has better contrast, I honestly don't think I'd need it to be better. I can read perfectly fine and pictures look great on the screen. Another thing that I love about the nook is that you can personalize the screensaver and background (I know that's not really important, but I like having my favorite pics on my nook).\n\nAnyway, I'm really happy with the nook and I think it was well worth the money. An ereader will never take the place of actual books for me, I still buy both. I usually read free classics and pay for the books that I know I won't really ever want to read again (like the paperbacks I used to buy from target or walmart). Other books that I know I will want to keep to reread, I buy the physical copy. I love the price of ebooks too. Usually they are either equal to or less than the cost of regular books and you can sometimes find them for super cheap! I've never tried the kindle, but honestly I'd say they're probably fairly equal when it comes down to it (I mean really reading a book on a screen doesn't vary that much).

Before I purchased it, I spent weeks researching the differences between the Barnes and Noble Nook and the Kindle and other ereaders. I chose the Nook because I can read .epub format books on it; something you cannot do on the Kindle. The Kindle only supports .pdf files and ebooks in the proprietary Amazon.com format. That severely limits the number and type of ebooks you can read.\n\nWith the Nook, I have borrowed free ebooks from my local library and within minutes downloaded them to my computer and then transferred them to my Nook. AWESOME! In addition, unlike the Kindle, I can read free ebooks available from Google.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about the Nook and the Kindle is that neither one of them has a back-lit screen so, at night or in the dark, you have to have alternative ample light. So I either turn on a lamp or use the small, clip-on light I bought at the local RiteAid for about $10. It works just fine.\n\nSo far, I have had no problems navigating my ebooks; everything works smoothly and the pages turn quickly. I'm enjoying the convenience of being able to travel with 30 books and audio-books at a time. I also have some music loaded on my Nook so I can listed to it while I read.

My first attempt at owning a Kindle resulted in two failing devices for which I eventually obtained a refund.\n\nMy birthday is today; my brother asked me what I wanted two weeks ago and I told him the Kindle. Unfortunately at that precise moment Amazon was right in the middle of rolling out the new Wi-Fi only Kindle and all models were unavailable.  So, I went for the barnes & noble nook Wi-Fi only.\n\nConsidering my previous experience with the Kindle, I tried not to get too excited. I went on the net to read reviews of the nook and was fearful. I read that it was buggy, that it lagged when you changed pages, that the touch interface was not all that responsive.\n\nAll of this was wrong; the page turns are quick and do not interrupt the flow of reading.  The touch interface is very nice and I like seeing my book covers in color. When you choose the Cover Flow, your books slide by with the touch of a finger and you simply tap on the book you want to read at that moment.  This was surprisingly helpful when I went to make purchases on the B&N Store. I know you don't judge a book by its cover, but how many times has a nice colorful packaging led me to a book I wanted to read, uhm; many times. I was really intrigued with the \"swipe\" page turn that you used the touch screen for, however this did not seem to function correctly on the store model or on my own nook. Strangely, after a period of time, it now works perfectly. A representative told me it simply had to adapt to my touch...I don't know how much I trust that statement, however when she turned a page on the display nook it responded to her very well. (Perhaps it was a learning curve?)\n\nSide-loading documents: Wow, if you have any epub or pdf documents all you have to do is side load them and voila.  I do recommend a free program called Calibre, which organizes your books, helps you edit the tags, add a color cover, or convert to epub. Pdf is not very easy to read on the nook, but if you convert to epub it goes smoothly, unless there are alot of photos or images, which lessens the accuracy of the conversion. Calibre has even converted files like, Word-Doc, Html, Palm, etc. Calibre will let you pick and choose books to upload to the nook directly from the program; in other words it 'sees' the nook.\n\nDrawbacks to the nook: The battery life, that nifty little color touch screen eats the battery power like mad.  B&N claim that you get 10 days, cut that in half. I do not know if this is because I use the touch screen to do my page turns or not,(the other option being the side buttons) but I am leaning toward, maybe? LCD screens notoriously use power; but using the page turn function does not require the back-light to be on, so I am not sure how it is eating up the battery so badly. It is honestly not that much of a problem for me. I am around my computer so much that it is unlikely a day will go by without it being attached to the CPU or an outlet next to my bed. I have gone almost four days with not re-charging; and I could see that little power icon decrease at least to slightly more than half in that time.\n\nOh - and that nifty little cover flow on the color screen.  Don't expect it to work for Your Documents.  (There are two libraries, the B&N purchased books and your side-loaded books or documents.) Also there is no way to sort your documents to your specification so you either sort by author, title, or the date you loaded them, very annoying if you build up a nice library; which is highly likely considering you can add an SD card to your nook and increase memory to 16 maybe 32 gigabytes. Speaking of which with that ability to increase memory, it would have been nice if the MP3 Player interface were a little more sophisticated.  An interesting ability is to play an unabridged audio-book and read the book at the same time. I am not sure who would do that, but then again I understand spoken Spanish more than I am capable of reading it.  This might be useful to me in that area, if I can find the matching audio-book/ Spanish-book. (Nuance in foreign language is often lost in English translation.)\n\nNever having owned a functioning 3G eBook-reader, I never really missed it with my home Wi-Fi. I have discovered several places close to where I \"haunt\" which have AT&T free to my nook. I already have a huge collection of books lined up for me to read... so feeling a \"need\" for the 3G seems unlikely. I have always done this, collected books that line up, ready for me to read. (By the way... the in store B&N Wi-Fi connection has s*cked at every B&N store I have been to. Amazingly Border's free Wi-fi worked better, I just couldn't buy through the B&N store. I had to go to my smart phone, buy the book, and it uploaded.)\n\nSo how do I feel about my nook; I absolutely love it! To be fair however, had I received a functioning Kindle, I would have felt the same way about it, I am certain. I think the Kindle has deficiencies with the lack of a touch/color interface and the side loading documents ability. However, that screen kills the battery as I stated.  The reason for liking the separate touch interface is that you don't want to touch your e-ink screen; I don't see how Sony's all touch interface e-reader is going to be popular when you are smudging your read screen all the time, though I must admit I would like to try one out.\n\nThe nook is comfortable in all sorts of positions, laying in bed, on the couch, holding it next to you; even laying it away from you and increasing the font so that you could read without holding it. I highly recommend a reading light, especially if you had grown accustomed to reading LCD screens in the dark (my kindle program on my Android phone.)\n\nIt is rather frustrating, I would have preferred a Kindle simply because I was impressed with Amazon customer service when my Kindle malfunctioned.\n\nI do recommend the nook. It would be nice if they would lessen DRM restrictions so I could buy books from Amazon or any other place for that matter.\n\nSincerly\nR", "summary": "nook wifi is it a worthy e-reader?

I went with the Nook Touch with glow light because the light makes the background almost white, and so the text stands out better on a slightly glowing background that doesn't flicker and isn't tiring on the eyes.

Rather than a list of book titles, as on the Kindle, the covers show up (like on the Kindle app), and it's easier to choose the book you want just by a glance and a touch.  There's also a convenient \"back\" key that shows up on the top middle of the screen when pressing a footnote so you can easily return to the text page.\n\nThe only thing I miss (but she won't) is the lack of ability to have the text read.

It's nice not to have to find a home for a book that I've read but don't want to keep.  With this product, the advantages are that it is lightweight, you can increase/change the font and size, which is a huge advantage if you have vision issues, you don't accumulate physical books that you don't want to keep, and the Glowlight at night is fantastic when you want to read when your partner is ready for lights out.

The Kindle - gets all of the rave - and maybe it deserves it  - but I am not convinced.  I recently bough a second generation Paperwhite - but do not even like the way it feels in my hand - so - I went looking for the NST with glow light.  What I love about the NST is its simplicity - all functions that I need are delivered with one - maybe two clicks -  I also love that it readily reads ePubs and PDFs and has an expandable memory slot - making it easy root - which I have done only so that I can get the Kindle app.  I have not had any luck with that so far.  So, if you have rooted this recently and have the Kindle app- please advise.\n\nThe text is not as crisp as it is on the Papwerwhite - but then again - this is not the most recent model of the NST.  For that model BN went and eliminated the two great features that made the NST stand out from the Kindle - expandable memory slot and the physical buttons.  Now - I am generally a touch screen person.  I never thought I would miss the physical buttons on my e-reader, but then I started using the Paperwhite two weeks ago, I absolutely did not like having to swipe the screen to advance the page.  With the NST - the border on which your fingers grip the device is exactly where you press  to advance the pages - you never have to move a finger onto the screen itself.  However, if you want to, it has touchscreen functionality too.\n\nThe NST is also much more comfortable in my small hands - although it is a wider device. This is because part of the back of of it is recessed - giving about an inch of a border all around it for me to grip onto it.  I never feel as if the device will slip out of my hands.  I cannot say the same about the Paperwhite.\n\nWhere the Kindle shines - is in offering features such as X-ray and the the lower costs and greater # title offerings on Amazon.  However - the Kindle's features are too often buried - and you do have to search for them - including for the light.  On the NST - you can turn on the light function simply by holding the home button on the front of the device for 2 seconds, a good feature for when you are reaching for your NST in the dark.  You cannot do this on the Kindle -\n\nI know that some people have complained about a blueish hue to the light - but so far - and I have had mine for only two days - I do not see it. The light technology is more advanced on the Kindle - but once again - it is also a more recent device.  And because the light emanates from the top of the device - yes - there is less of an even distribution of it across the page - but it is not anything glaring and does not at all take away from the reading experience. The light on the NST does not detract from that e-ink feel while. The first time I turned on the Kindle's light I felt like I was reading on a tablet and thought - \"THIS is the experience I am trying to get away from.\"\n\nNothing against the Kindle -  I got my first experience with it when I bought my g/f one for her birthday last month and thought that it certainly was worth getting one. I actually first bought the original NST at a great price - but thought that that Kindle would be a better fit for her needs - and this is how I ended up with two NSTes -  and then this one with glow light last week after I was not too impressed with the Paperwhite. Since I was able to get the latest Paperwhite at a $50 discount I - and jumped on it.  I do not know if I have buyer's remorse - it is more that from the start - my very first NST provided me with everything I wanted in an e-reader.  Then the light technology came around and I wanted that - but was not willing to pay the price for this item - just a year after I had purchased the original one without light for $149.  So, I waited.  I do buy most of my books from Amazon simply because they have better prices -but truth be told - once I figure out how to get that Kindle app on my  NSTes - I might just go ahead and sell the Kindle - unless some of these  extra features it has wows me so much that they heighten my reading experiences.  So far, this has not happened.\n\nIf you do not need an e-reader with a whole lot of bells - but you want one that had a great light - feels good in the hand - and give you the flexibility of reading all e-texts formats (once rooted correctly) - then this is your device. I was surprised that this cost more than the latest Nook Glowlight - but it could be because it is in higher demand because of both the expandable memory - and physical buttons.  If those things are important to you as well on an e-ink reader- well then - certainly the NST or NST with glowlight  - is your best option.

I paid a measly $26 +s/h for a grand total of $36. I also have a new BNRV350 coming my way in a couple of days and I may update the review. In my technology arsenal I have/had/used a BNRV300 (no glowlight version), Ipad 2, Galaxy Note 2, Galaxy Notepro 12.2 and Galaxy Note 8 tablet.\n\nI love the glowlight BNRV350 after I rooted it. This means that I am able to read various file formats (pdf, cbr, cbz, prc, txt, rtf, doc, docx, mobi, epub) I bought the glowlight because I wanted the advantage of reading at night versus a booklight with my BNRV300 (which I still love very much) And the most important, read on the beach in BRIGHT SUNLIGHT! Even though my BNRV350 had cracks in it and the glowlight seeped out it did not bother my reading ability. (Heck I only paid $36 for it LOL)\n\nI compared the BNRV350 and BNRV300 side by side and noticed the that BNRV300 had a brighter screen/image than the BNRV350. I have researched/googled that the BNRV350 has some sort of screen protector/glare protector. So that was a tiny thumbs down for me. However reading at night with the glowlight on is 3 thumbs up. Definitely much better compared to a booklight. Of course the downside is that the battery drains faster. I haven't done a 2nd test but I think my battery was down to 29% after having the glowlight turned on for 3/4 hours I think. There is also a small lag time when you press the touch screen. The side buttons are a bit of a pain in pressing. You have to be exact when you press them otherwise you're not pressing anything. I don't really use the buttons because I don't want to wear them up so I use the touch screen to go to the next page and an Android App (button saviour) so I don't wear the buttons and N button out. Also having the MICROSD feature is 10 thumbs up! I can put lots and lots of files. You can only up to 32gb MICROSD though. Even though Ive rooted this tablet and will be able to use other apps such as internet browsing, email, calculator, etc. etc. I have my other electronic tablets for that. I just love that I can read in the bright sunlight with this thing and am able to read all the various formats. The reason I bought a lot of the nooks (I have a new BNRV300 and another (new) BNRV350 coming) is because they have discontinued this product. The newer versions does not have the microsd version and heck to the no for that. I want to make sure if my Nook gets damaged I have a spare one.  I recommend this if you can get a good price for it and if you also don't get those dreaded glowlight holes. <cross fingers> that my new BNRV350 will not have that.

I bought the one with the memory slot and LOVE that feature. The glowlight and memory card slot are what sold me to buy the Nook and not any of the other E-readers. I fought getting an e-reader for years as I love the look and feel of a real book in my hands. My library also has e-books I can 'check' out without leaving my home. Another fantastic feature! And with book sharing from Barnes and Nobles... I couldn't fathom why anyone would want to buy any of the others. Still don't for that matter. The glowlight, if you are a big time reader and like to read in bed next to a sleeping spouse, is perfection. The light isn't intrusive and my husband is finally able to sleep right through the soft glow in the room as opposed to reading on my cell phone with that light. The battery also lasts me through an entire night, even with the glowlight on.\n\nFast forward one year. I set up both bottom buttons to forward me to the next page. Around the 6 month mark the one I used most often gave me problems. I hit it and around every 2 to 5 times of hitting it to forward just one page, it goes nuts and starts forwarding and wont' stop. I have to hit the back button over and over to try to make it stop. Then I have to work at finding what page I was on. Fast forward another 6 months and the other bottom button is now doing the same thing. I can switch what the outward buttons do, so I can set up another one to forward through, however I'm worried that in another 6 months that one will go bad too. This is the main reason I am giving it 3 stars.\n\nI have dropped my nook several times and I have not had the cracking problem. But I do get little nicks in it once in awhile that you can only see when the glowlight is on. I get them when something is dropped onto the nook. But I haven't gotten lines or major cracks. Just little tiny ones. Oddly enough after I clean the screen really well and let it rest it often clears up on it's own. I don't understand why or how it works, but am happy it does.\n\nThe other problem that bothers me is it sometimes garbles. Meaning it has two or three pages overlapping on one page. I've talked to everyone that has other e-readers (all the other brands in fact) and all have the same issue. That garbling is a problem on all of them. It's a simple fix, you simply go back a page and then go back to your page and it's gone.\n\nI bought a leather case that makes it all a little heavier, but it also protects it from any major fall since I seem to drop everything at least once a week. I also use the lid part to block even more light for my husband.\n\nAll in all... this solid book lover wonders why she waited to get an e-reader. I use a program to make sure I label the books with what number each book is in a series. So when I am done reading one book I simply hit two buttons and then touch the next book in order. And I'm reading the next book within 10 seconds or less. I don't have to get up, I don't have to go find the book. Since I labeled them as what book number they are, i don't have to go figure out what book is next.\n\nAll of this time and I haven't bought a book from using the wi-fi. I simply go online and look for the cheapest version and buy it and then put it onto my memory card and go read it.\n\nThe only thing a book lover is truly going to hate when they go to an e-reader is that they buy the brand new book, in book form. online for around 8 dollars and the e-book is always around 15. Doesn't make sense to me. Publishers only allow books to be submitted, these days, in electronic form (generally word) and therefore it's already in an electronic form. So it should be the same price, or cheaper, in my opinion.\n\nBut you never have to leave your home, never have to get dressed if you are in your jammies, and never have to wait for the book to ship to you. Buy an e-book and you have the book immediately. Though the main problem I have been having is many authors books are only in mobi form, which ticks me off. Which means I have to buy and download the book and then have to use a program to convert it to epub.\n\nI only have used my memory card to keep my books on. I have a 16G and so far I think I have around 400 books on it. When it's full, I'll just get another card. That way I can keep my library with me and not up in the air where someone could choose to shut down an account and leave me without my books. That and I love having my library at my fingers and yet not taking up tons of space in my house. All in all.. it's been a hard and drawn out move for this book lover. But I'd jump and do it much sooner if I had to do it again. When nostalgic, I go pick up one of my real books, hold, read a little from it. Then can go back to my nook. My favorite electronic in the house.\n\nUPDATE: 3 years. darn thing isn't working right at all anymore. Really bummed! Love my e-reader.

As to the screen lighting, it is childishly simple - just a row of 8 led lights across the top. Works OK; but, is clearly just top lighting spilling down across screen.\n\nControls are for the most part intuitive and easy to access and use.

So, I'll give my experience with both.\n\nUsed Nook (Had for a bit more than a week before I returned it. Was originally 4 years old when I purchased it): It came with two faded lines that went across the screen that would be apparent during reading. It wash;t that big of a deal for me since the lines were above the sentences and didn't bother me while reading and seeing how since my device was about four years old, I didn't care too much. Though when the battery couldn't hold a charge I had to send it back.\n\nCurrent New Nook (Have had it for about a week): When I looked at the default factory settings screen to set up my nook, I noticed a small tear on the screen (I thought maybe I was imaging it but when I turned the glow light on, it was apparent [...]) as stated in that link, the tear isn't a problem when the glow light is off and in general isn't that noticeable. After using the nook for about maybe five days, I found another tear on the screen. When I turned the glow light on, the first tear that the device came with didn't spill the light throw it like in the picture in the link. The second tear actually did, but it isn't very often that I used the glow light and I don't think it's worth it to return the item since your next device might have either the same problem or the faded lines across the screen, but if it does bother you during your read, you might wanna take that chance.\n\nProtection: I had purchased this silicone skin for my nook and I love it; it makes pressing the page turn buttons a lot easier to press and I love the feel of the case in general.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005J7EOE2/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nI have also recently purchased this case:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007UXNHRS/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Which is decent enough for the price, though I can't fit the nook with the silicone case in there which is a bummer since with this case, it's kinda awkward for me to turn the page with the buttons since I'm so used to the extra width of the silicone case (I know I can just turn the page by swiping the screen, which I do at times, but I enjoy clicking the page turning buttons.)So in general for this case, you get a decent case for the price, but if you want to invest a bit more money for a higher quality case, go right on ahead. I'm only 16 and paid for all of these with my own money so I wanted to save as much as I could (which is why I had originally bought the used nook).\n\nPro's of Nook Simple Touch with Glow Light:\n-It has a touch screen\n-The glow light is bright enough to read clearly, yet dim enough to not bother your eyes if you're reading in the dark, unlike my iPad 2 when even at its lowest brightness setting, seems still too bright at night.\n-I really enjoy that it has page turning buttons as well\n-The micro SD card slot is why I bought this device to begin with (haven't used it yet, but the general memory on the device is pretty good; I only read fanfiction on this device)\n-Importing books (fanfiction/e-pub files) is really easy; all you need is Calibre to import it onto your nook [...] and an epub file converter [...]\n-The device is very light weight\n-Holds a charge very well if the battery is good\n\nCons:\n-The battery may not hold a charge; depends on your device in general\n-May end up with a tear on the screen when glow light is on\n-May end up with faded lines across screen that you can't get rid of\n-Device has wifi but no internet browser; it only brings/connects you to the barnes and noble store to purchase and then download their books; the wifi in general is just useless on this device\n\nAll in all I say give this device a try; it's a lot different compared to the kindle and all the other e-readers on the market.

It has the side buttons, which Barnes and Noble eliminated in the later Glowlight, and I appreciate those as well.\n\nMy husband was so impressed with my Simple Touch with Glowlight that he wanted one.  Barnes and Noble had stopped selling them,  but they are still available on Amazon and other sites.  We bought his from a third party and made sure to get a SquareTrade Warranty just in case.  Within a week, his developed a \"tear\" in the screen.  As many others have described, the actual screen itself remains in good shape, but the membrane beneath the screen tears and allows light through.  Very distracting to try to read with it.  Barnes and Noble now acknowledges this is a manufacturing defect.  (I asked when I bought mine and made sure that it was covered by their warranty.)  Luckily, SquareTrade honored the warranty immediately and I bought my husband a replacement (with SquareTrade Warranty) the same day.  So far, so good.\n\nBecause Barnes and Noble has removed features I value from the newer Glowlight, we will keep trying until we get two of these Simple Touch with Glowlights that work without tears.  It seems to be a defect which appears in some of the Simple Touch with Glowlights, but not others.  For us, it is worth the hassle of going through a few until we get good ones.  I have so many books which are not Barnes and Noble that I would immediately fill the .5G allowed for non-Barnes and Noble content on the new Glowlight.

I love it. I have had no problems; works like it should. I was surprised to see so many people had received defective devices and wanted to let you know that these are amazing ereaders and you can have a perfectly normal, blah experience like me. It is no better or worse than any other ereader out there. It is my second, so most of my review will be a comparison.\n\nI want my ereader to do ONE THING. I have a tablet for other stuff, iPods, phones, etc. I use an ereader for reading in bed. I have a first gen Nook that still works great, but I hated the user interface. The dual screens were annoying (you always want to touch the upper screen!) and the menus were not intuitive. And that shiny white frame - no! So I was happy to see that in this version all those problems were solved. It features a lovely matte black frame with a rubberized finish and the glowlight is just perfect. Its brightness is fully adjustible and not uneven or distracting.\n\nNotes:\n- BN gimps the expandable memory of their devices. They suck in this way. 32GB memory card? Nope. That sucker's gonna hold about 230MB. Annoying. Please let me know if they pull their heads out and fix this.\n- I sideload all my ebooks using Calibre. It is very easy to drag and drop books on and off when you plug it in via USB.  On my 1st gen, I kept about 500 on there at any time (because I could!). That was a bad idea. The library menus were 50 pages long! On this device I only keep about 75 titles. They fit just fine without any extra memory, as they should.\n- I no longer use BN to purchase books, but when I did it was very easy. I could buy them from the device itself or from another and they would magically appear in my Library.\n- The library allows you to browse through the book covers. I am a visual person, so this is another advantage over the non-image 1st gen.\n- EPUB! If you don't know, now you know. In the ereader wars, this is the Nook's leg up. EPUB is the standard, non-proprietary format for ebooks. It is easy enough to convert ebooks to other formats, but why should you have to? ALL ereaders accept EPUB files (except Kindle), so it's just one less thing to worry about.\n- My best pal has the 1st gen Kindle and also the touchscreen version. She loves them.

We have tablets for pretty much every person in the family in multiple sizes... still, I prefer to read on a eInk reader.  I've owned a Kindle 2, and 3, & a Nook Classic, so this is my fourth eInk reader though I have had a grey scale reader, Libre Pro, which is similar in that it has no backlight but the contrast just doesn't compare.  Still even that is easier on the eyes for long length reading than the tablets.\n\nSo I wanted a eInk that I could read at night, with as little light as possible to not disturb, without a reading light.  I had been looking at the Glow and then the Paperwhite for a while and finally decided to buy the Kindle.  Most reviews has it as the winner.  CNET was very close but Kindle still won for mainly versatility in products and screen.  So ordered the Paperwhite for me and a friend, we would order a second if both of us liked it.  She tried it out first and said that it just wasn't responsive enough, didn't turn pages fast enough, and everything took too long.  I think that the actually product was faulty there though because going to setting was like being on dial up Internet, slow as sin.  Still, I would have sent it back for a replacement except that when I got it and used it for about a week (I didn't have page turning issues as I don't read as fast), I found that reading it at night was NOT what I hoped for.  First it had four prominent half moon dark spots at the bottom of the screen.  I might have been able to get over that just as I have the light bleed at the top of the Nook Glow, except that the screen throughout is not uniformly lighted, especially at the lowest settings.  Since I am using this in a completely dark room, I only care about the lowest settings.  The non-uniformity of the screen was the breaking point.  I never got used to it.\n\nSo I returned the Paperwhite, my friend decided to go for a tablet (Nook HD+ because of the responsiveness of tablets and the size, not my preference) and I decided to try out the Glow.  I've heard there are problems with bleed through pin pricks of light from damage on the very sensitive screen.  They now come with screen protectors already installed and I am hoping it protects from that.  Still I figured for the sale price I could use it as a eInk reader without the light if that does occur in the future.\n\nWhat I like about the Glow\n- page back and page forward buttons on bezel on both sides of the screen.  Paperwhite does not have this.\n- very low light setting.  Paperwhite again doesn't have this.  Many reviews actually state the paperwhites brightness to be a selling point, why?  I'm reading it in the dark so want a low light.\n- the lighting is even along the screen where you are actually reading, yes there is a light at the top of the screen but it is not distracting, less so than a clip on light by far.\n- Easy to use interface.\n- Actual home button at the bottom middle of the screen to wake up reader and hold to toggle the glow light off and on.  Fewer step to adjust the lighting than the paperwhite.\n- Glow light turns off... completely. Paperwhite is always on.  In a low light room, I'm OK with no Glow and Paperwhite's uneven lighting was poor for me in low light settings unless I turned it bright.\n- I found it slightly more comfortable to hold than the Paperwhite, it is lighter but I don't think that was it as it is pretty inconsequential.  I think it was the shape.\n- SD expansion slot to up to 32GB more.\n- Price\n\nWhat is not so great\n- back and forward buttons are a little tiring to fingers after a while, so left hand holding is only comfortable for a while.  Right hand can always tap gently on the screen instead of the button. Kindle 3 and 4 have easy buttons to push.\n- Only 250MB of internal storage for side loaded content, another 1GB for Nook books and content, though there is a micro SD expansion.  So both Paperwhite and Glow have 2GB but a bit is used for operating system and then the Nook takes most of what is left over for B&N content.  I found that 4GB of Kindle 3 was just right for me and the 2GB Kindle 2 and Paperwhite was lacking as once they get too full they start lagging.  Why they downgraded the Paperwhite, Touch and Kindle 4??\n- Side loaded content has to be side unloaded also. No deletion method from the Glo directly.  Nook books you can double tap and archive and they are taken off your Glo, not deleted from you library.\n- Power button on back gets covered by cases.  I end up not putting the Glo in standby but just wait for it to go off by itself.\n\nSo overall I am really happy with my Glow.  My Nook Classic stopped charging, the charging port died, after 3 years.  My Kindle 2 still works but I gave it away to a friend.  My Kindle 3 is still my favorite eInk reader of all time, the Glow is a quick 2nd mainly because of size and light.  If the light every stops working correctly, I'll use it as a non-lighted eInk reader and still be happy as I paid 1/2 the price of a Paperwhite, the same price as a Kindle 4, and no ads, and comes with a charger.  A month in and I'm very happy.  Got a Squaretrade warranty as just in case though.\n\nEdit and added ---\nI recently got another Paperwhite while on sale as I kept hearing great things and wanted a second eInk night reader.  One of my friends checked her low light setting on a 2nd Generation. They fixed the issue of the splotchy lighting and the low light setting is lower than the Nook's.  Other than the side buttons, which I love on my Nook, it is the better device now, that is the 2nd Generation Paperwhite.  Slightly sharper, slightly smaller, bigger memory without a card, brighter and dimmer light settings.  Still I think the first generation should be avoided.\n\nSo another edit---\nWe got a 3rd gen Paperwhite with the same resolution of the Voyage. I actually don't notice the difference from the 2nd gen. It is slightly nicer than the Nook. I still read on my Nook frequently as I might have two books going and just read one on one and the other on the other. I hated the ads on the Paperwhite so ended up paying the $30 to get rid of them so even on sale it cost $130 in the end. So the really issue is... is it worth the price difference. $70 vs $130 (or $150 vs $100 when not on sale) They both work for library books.", "summary": "So far very happy.

I must have read hundreds of books on that little device.  It was just about perfect.  Small and light enough (size of a paperback, weight of a hardback) that I could hold it one hand, easy thumb controls, had a backlight for nighttime reading, I could read the screen in daylight (most of the time) and it stored a bunch of books.  Heck, it even had a stylus for lookup and markup.  The day the battery no longer held a charge a small part of me died with it...\n\nSo, the day the iPads came out I quickly adopted them as my go to E-reader. Great devices and they do many things well but they aren't really conducive to being E-readers.  Don't get me wrong, I've read many, many books on my iPads but they've always been just a bit clumsy.  Too big, too heavy, and there's never been a comfortable thumb control for me while holding it. I'm sure the newer and smaller iPad would go a great way to solving some of those problems but all iPads are still basically creatures of the night.  Besides draining my wallet they tend to shrink from the sunshine.  I'll never ditch my iPad but i really, REALLY wanted my old E-reader back.  I didn't want something what would flash the home team's score, an Email telling me my spam filter is less than effective or someone messaging me a picture of their meal all the while I'm trying to immerse myself in one my favorite author's far flung fantasies.  I JUST WANT TO READ A DARN BOOK IN PEACE!  So for a while, GASP, I went back to \"real\" books.  I know, I was weak and no matter how many times I punched that unknown word with my stylus those stupid BOOKS wouldn't bring up a single dictionary.\n\nI've seen E-Ink products for a while.  I remember when the technology was first introduced and how it was going to revolutionize the world. Yeah, whatever.  E-Ink and a perpetual motion machine and we'd be all set.  I think it was Sony that first introduced a viable product.  Good but those screens - egads!  Well, let me say that times have changed.  The current crop of E-ink technology is pretty amazing.  Not perfect but amazing non the less.  I was able to put my hands on the Nook and was very much impressed.  first off, it's light, VERY light.  The E-Ink looks great and the backlight is perfect.  Lots of little features pushed me over the edge such as WiFi for purchases and downloads and a touch screen for a myriad of uses.  As soon as I had my own Nook in hand I down three books on my list.  Wow, it was great!  It goes everywhere with me and when I'm reading, I'M READING.  No distractions.  If I want distractions I'll leave my phone close by.  It really is an amazing device that harkens back to my original Rocket E-book reader - but better.  I love being able to change pages by just touching the side of the screen.  Battery life is amazing assuming I'm not leaving the backlight on all the time and even then it's not too shabby.  I find sometimes I like to turn on the backlight even during the day instead of turning on a lamp.\n\nI gave the Nook 5 stars because it really does everything that it claims to do.  It's a great E-book reader and the cost is pretty cheap imho.  I'm very happy with my purchase and I would absolutely recommend this device to anyone who's interested in mono purpose device.\n\nGripes, very few and very minor.  The device has four raised marks on its face.  Two on the left and two on the right.  They're buttons for page forward and reverse and can be switch in software as to which set goes forward such and so forth.  I don't use them as I have a hard time pressing them.  I find that if you don't press these lines dead center you aren't pressing the button underneath and there's no tactile feedback that you're on the center of the line.  Perhaps a little dimple or such, similar to the home keys on a keyboard, might help.  Even dead center I find the buttons require a bit more \"push\" than I find easy to do without thinking.  As i said previously, I find it much easier to simply swipe or tap the screen to advance the pages.  Which leads me to touching or swiping the screen.  Sometimes it works a little too well.  When I'm reading a book and have my thumb close to the screen in anticipation of changing the page it will sometimes trigger the page turn without ever actually touching the screen.  Unless it's developed ESP I think it's a just a tad too sensitive.  Also, when I do actually touch the screen, on rare occasions, it will double advance or triple advance the page.  Screen refreshes are much better than 1st gen devices but in bright light there's still a slight ghosting.  They mitigate that by performing a full screen flash every four page turns.  You'll notice the whole screen turn black very quickly before the text returns.  Again, no issues in normal light and I can only see ghosting in very bright direct sunshine.  The only other issue worth mentioning is the Micro SD slot.  I've read that many people have had problems with this slot not holding the memory cards, it tends not to \"lock\" them into place.  I had that same problem and was about to replace the device when it just started working.  Perhaps I wasn't pushing the SD deep enough into the slot as it has to go flush with the opening before it clicks now.  It also gave me some guff in recognizing the card but after a reboot (not just powering off) everything was again hunky dory.\n\nAll said and done I find it a delightful little device and I look forward to reading many more books with it.

I was in love with this thing at one point in time. However, it has a horrible defect that I just cannot live with. If you sideload your books (add your own books to a memory card instead of purchasing from Barnes and Noble), everytime you turn the device completely off and on (like in the event of it freezing, like mine's has done more than once) all of your shelves (like collections on Kindle) will erase. Disappear, your shelves are empty. It also happens if you disconnect your Nook from your Macbook the wrong way.\n\nAs a person with around 800 sideloaded books, this is completely unacceptable.

But Barnes and Noble has gimped this feature with this horrible glitch and refuses to fix it or even acknowledge that it even exists!

The reader is great. I downloaded PDFs and books from the kindle and nook store. There weren't any issues. The services I used are Spotify and Prime Music apps. Spotify locked up maybe twice so far, which isn't a deal. And Prime music is good, but the artwork is really blurry for some reason. Its not a big deal either. They are both good for listening to music. TuneIn Radio worked well.\n\nFor movies I used Netflix. I didn't have any issues with the app. The navigation was easy and videos played smoothly. As far as other apps, theres plenty to choose from. The tablet comes with Google app store and the Samsung app store. Battery life was perfect. I thought it would the battery would die out fast since I use the tablet, but it didn't. There's also a power save option that you could use. It changes the tablet settings to make the battery last even longer. One small issue that bothered me is the notification alert. Its a annoying whistle sound. Minor flaws aside, this is a very good tablet. One more thing, I'll update this review as I test out more of the features.\n\nUpdate. I forgot to add in my review that kindle books do work on here. I was reading books on the Kindle app. I took some screenshots of the features that I used, but for some weird reason its not letting me add photos to the \"customer image\" section or into my review.

Granted we are talking about a work of fiction her, but really all works of fiction have an element of truth to them...at least the good ones do.

Certainly, I figured very early that human trafficking was somehow involved.  Imagine my pleasant surprise to be gripped by plot twists and turns and to be totally riveted for the entirety of the story's concluding chapters.  For a reader who reads many mystery novels, Bad Traffic was able to maintain a high level of suspense throughout its pages and deliver its shockers without giving away too much in the beginning of the book.  As such, it was a pretty well crafted story.\n\nLewis does a fabulous job of generating authenticity with his character's mannerisms, speech, and personalities with regard to their Chinese ethnicity and especially when it comes to the description of an individual set loose in a strange place, no common language, and entirely different cultures.  I imagine that Lewis drew upon his own experience as a traveler in China and Japan (Lewis is also the author of the Rough Guides to China, Beijing, and Shanghai), it is particularly a talent that he can scrutinize his own native land of the United Kingdom from the lens of a middle-aged Chinese man.  This being said, I do have to admit that the writing overall was mediocre and that Lewis's strength is in the plot and not the actual narrative.

The classic concept of a \"stranger in a strange land\" should have been fascinating.  It's a sad statement when the common element, which proved comforting for Jian, was signs for McDonalds, KFC and Nike.\n\nUnfortunately, my enthusiasm for the story waned quickly.

Only at the very end do you see some slight humanity and redemption, but it's too little, too late.  The bad guys are very, very bad.  The migrant worker Ding Ming, was the exception but, because of his circumstances, he was such a weak character I lost interest.

Which perhaps also helps to explain why it periodically pops up as the basis for fiction and film, as in this rapid-fire thriller. The twist this book provides is one of perspective -- instead of seeing human smuggling through the eyes of a sympathetic Western law enforcement hero seeking a young Westerner who has disappeared in some exotic locale, we see it through the eyes of a Chinese policeman trying to find his daughter in England. The classic fish-out-of-water device is given fresh life here, simply because we're not used to seeing the West as a foreign land filled with strange signs and cultural cues. But non-English-speaking Chinese cop Ma Jian is almost completely adrift in and around Leeds as he struggles to find a Mandarin speaker to help him.\n\nThe hunt for his missing daughter takes place over five action-packed days, pitting him against a cardboard crew of \"snakeheads\" (human traffickers) who bring Chinese into England illegally, and keep them trapped in a life of indentured servitude/slavery. A secondary storyline follows one of these smuggled-in workers as his naive faith in his new life slowly unravels as he in separated from his wife and set to manual labor. He happens to speak some English, which sets him apart from the other Fujian laborers he's placed with, and through a series of misadventures, ends up as the cop's hostage/sidekick. They make a very fun odd couple as they race around the countryside trying to locate the snakeheads. Lewis does a great job presenting their Chinese point-of-view, which has to feel authentic for the book to work. Unfortunately, he also employs an awkward framework that switches between three different narrative viewpoints and several different timelines, making for some confusing reading at times. Other flaws include the villains, who have virtually no depth to them at all, and a plot twist toward the end that pretty much every reader will see coming a mile away.\n\nStill, if you like thrillers, this is a pretty solid one that comes from an interesting perspective. The corrupt Chinese cop makes for an interesting anti-hero, as he is forced to confront his shallowness and culpability in his daughter's peril. And the sidekick is a wonderfully panicky teenager whose confusion over whom to trust is both tragic and comic. The pacing is great, with nonstop momentum and plenty of action interspersed.

Judd", "reviewText": "In the early 1980s, Martin Cruz Smith and Stuart M. Kaminsky--more or less simultaneously--wrote novels that followed decent detectives stuck investigating crime in the evil setting of the USSR. A few years later, Philip Kerr followed with the Bernhard Gunther books, which did the same thing for Nazi Berlin. Nowadays, the device is fairly common, The best recent example may be, Qiu Xiaolong's Chief Inspector Chen Cao books, set in the People's Republic of China. The appeal of the genre is that it amps up the tension of the original hard-boiled detectives, who only had to worry about the cops, the manipulative rich, and gangsters. For these newer heroes, it is the entire system of their native lands that is devoted to hiding truth and thwarting justice. They have to put themselves at tremendous risk to solve crimes and are required by their milieu to make compromises with their consciences. When done well, as by these authors, it is a form that makes for great reading.\n\nIf we forget about the Arnold Schwarzenegger film, Red Heat--and it does deserve forgetting--Simon Lewis may be one of the first to reverse this idea and have a detective/policeman from a totalitarian nation come to the West to investigate a crime. In this case, Inspector Jian travels from Beijing to Britain in search of his daughter, who's disappeared from University after a frantic phone call. Mr. Lewis makes the most of the fish-out-of-water potential and even works in a more naive sort of sidekick, Ding Ming, an illegal immigrant worker whose wife is missing. The view of England through their eyes is revealing and often funny and the action sequences are handled smoothly.\n\nBut I had a problem with the whole exercise. Why exactly am I supposed to root for a PRC henchman? Here's how Jian is described:\n\n  He had loved and hated as directed and worshipped Mao without reservation. There'd been songs and passion and a sense of purpose. Then times changed, and the lights he'd been brought up to live by had been shown to lead nowhere. Past struggles had been revealed as a tremendous waste of time. his idol Mao was an old f[***] and a fraud. Well, he would not be fooled again. He believed in nothing now -- there was only luck and money, and you'd better have one or the other.\n\nCall me old-fashioned, but I want more than that from my heroes. And his daughter is nearly as unsympathetic. The help he ends up providing to Ding Ming and the fact that the crooks he's up against are so reprehensible does enable us to root for him by the end, but rather reluctantly. Generally when we come upon his sort in a noir it is his demise we enjoy, not his triumph.

Ranzoni", "reviewText": "Human trafficking and snuff have become pretty popular topics in the last nine years of fiction, it seems to me. And so has China, practically a medieval nation outside its major cities until the turn of the century.\n\nGood genre writing--well, commercial writing at least--reflect current issues and cultural interests. Sure, but genre fiction really crackles when the author loves his or her subjects. Such is the case with Simon Lewis and his second \"travel/suspense\" novel, *Bad Traffic*.\n\nYou know what travel/suspense is--James Bond does it all the time. Historically, white slave traders would ship British girls across Asia, often with little regard for their safe arrival (they could always send more). But while I'm used to reading Brits or Americans threatened by sinister foreigners in distant lands, Lewis turns the thriller on its head. For the distant land is the West, and the foreigners speak English.\n\nInspector Jian, a widowed veteran and well-connected Chinese Police Inspector, sent his only child to Leeds University. Ostensibly for education, but practically to straighten out her troublesome streaks. Only trouble of the worst kind cries out of his cell phone one day, and 32 hours later, the good Inspector finds himself in England without a friend, a weapon, or a single word of the local language.\n\nDing Ming, an educated but poorly-connected husband, speaks English well enough to get himself into trouble. Which is one reason why he and his wife indebted themselves $40,000 plus interest to be smuggled into the Gold Mountain of Great Britain. His bosses seem perverted but fair, offering a generous 1 dollar an hour minus expenses. If only they hadn't separated him from his wife...\n\nYou know Jian and Ming will cross, in ways terrifying, exciting, and absurd. Especially when they cross Black Fort, a petty gangbanger with tong ambitions and an eye for daughters and wives.\n\n*Bad Traffic* is suspense all the way, replete with situational humor and subtle twists on the genre. What Jian lacks in local customs and comprehension, he more than makes up with police brutality, Red Guard training, and the cunning of a Chinese social strategist. Simon paints him as an over-the-hill Asian Bruce Willis, with less emphasis on the guns and more on the bullheaded rampage through the English shop, er, countryside. Jian's struggles remind him of his own country's dark and often murderous past, as the search for his daughter leads to desperate actions.\n\nMing knows darkness too, especially as a peasant who watched arrogant officials like Jian get life handed to them on a silver plate.  Yet his flight to England is one of wonder, surprise, and often painful naivet. Ming isn't exactly a comical sidekick, so much as a pitiable little guy who keeps up his optimism and devotion to duty, no matter how obscene the situation becomes.\n\nSimon weaves these protagonists into his plots like any good, if formulaic suspense writer. The story twists and turns like a sports car on hilly English roads, and practically every chapter changes the reality of whatever came before. Here and there, strategically placed sections backtrack to different POVs or plot threads, or otherwise delve into some seemingly mundane sideshow--often after a cliffhanger.\n\n*Bad Traffic* is violent and profane, but not graphically so. Lewis gets the point across--often in a deft lunge at the unsuspecting reader--with just the right amount of f-bombs and twitching limbs. He has an old fashioned appreciation for the dashing hero and the damsel in distress, while his story remains cognizant of the treatment of gender in Western societies. Objectification is limited to the bad people point of view, and female distress is largely de-sexualized. Most of the male characters, for their part, are neither muscle-toned Bruce Lees nor romantic rogues, but often pudgy and middle-aged working men.\n\nGetting into style, his prose is perfunctory and consistent. Lewis doesn't bog things down with chunks of back-story or description. Instead, character and setting flow along with the story. He is careful to limit narrative commentary or character thoughts. Nevertheless, the story teaches along the way, integrating Chinese and British culture directly into the action and dialogue.\n\nGiven this, the book is an easy read. Perhaps a bit lower on the scale than this very review, anybody with a ninth grade comprehension level should get it. I took three days to finish, only because of other work. This is an ideal read for a plane, train, or bus ride.\n\nStill, the writing sputters a bit. However tight, Simon still uses too many words to build his sentences. I'm also not a fan of the \"he was, she was\" speech style that Western writers took from Hemingway like a divine commandment. Finally, I didn't recognize some of the British slang, but understood it well enough in context.\n\nThat's all quibble anyways. I mainly found disappointment with how the story sometimes degenerates into cardboard gun fights or chases. One major character is a student of Wing Chun martial arts, but doesn't it put to use, especially not in the climax. Also, the writing is occasionally a little obtuse on details. I can't tell whether characters are shooting revolvers or semi-auto pistols, and the plot doesn't exploit details like this anyways. I know it's a stupid little thing, but it kind of threw me off when the bad guys periodically appear with shotguns, only to announce at the end that these were double-barreled hunting weapons, not pump-action police specials.\n\nOtherwise, this is my first Lewis Simon book. Through Amazon Vine, the first I've heard of him. As *Bad Traffic* is headlined as \"An Inspector Jian Novel\", I wouldn't mind seeing a series with his level of talent and cultural appreciation.\n\nAs such, it deserves to be the first Amazon Vine book I've awarded four stars.

I like that. I like something that makes me really think about what I believe. What seems right to me based on the information available?\n\nEvery book, relic, historical figure, etc was something I was able to find more information about on the web. I found some of that information particularly resonant for my own faith research. For that I am grateful.\n\nWhy not 5 stars?

While it's true that early in the 20th century there were studies that appeared to show a weight loss at the time of death of 21 grams, far more recent studies have shown no such loss.  One of the characters in the book, wonders why no one since that 1st  study has repeated it, as I already noted that they have.  Each time he does this I wonder why he didn't check his facts.  Books that weave strongly researched facts in with an original idea strengthen their characters and plot.  It diminishes the book.

It cost him his badge, but he has no regrets.\n\nNow, he runs his own private investigative firm.  The hours are crappy, he can barely keep the bills paid, but he is his own boss.

The first part of the book, the part shown off in the free Kindle sample enticed me.  It wasn't much further in, however, that the book started to drag for a bit.  There's a lot of establishment early on which slows things down, but I don't think I would have enjoyed the end if Leather hadn't established the world and people around Jack Nightingale so thoroughly.

What makes him shine is that the character is charming.  He's witty, intelligent, and competent.  He sets his logical mind towards solving the mystery around the appearance and suicide of a man claiming to be his father, the sudden windfall (and debt surrounding it), and supposed curse.  He is a rational man who doesn't believe that his father could have sold his soul.  However, as people start dying around him, he is shaken.  I found this easy to relate to; no matter how logical we may be, circumstances like Jack's would likely shake our foundations.\n\nWhen people around Jack start to die, he begins to question everything even as the police begin to suspect the body count that surrounds him.  He very much begins to believe that devils might be real, and one might come collecting for his soul.\n\nBy the end of the book, I was very invested in the character, and I must say that it was worth the slog towards the beginning.\n\nBottom Line:  read the free sample.

When he is contacted by a stuffy old solicitor and finds out that an eccentric millionaire has left him a mansion and a few obscure clues to his real past, Jack has to get his act together pretty quickly. With the help of his feisty assistant, Jack frantically works to find out why the people around him tell him he's going to hell and then kill themselves.\n\nThis is an entertaining beginning of a series.

The story is fast-paced and furious, often quite dark and nasty, but with unexpected bits of humor to lighten things just when it is most needed.\n\nThe only major problem I had was that there was some sloppiness in the editing department. Not spelling and grammar, but problems with inconsistencies in the plot. For instance, Jack explicitly says several times that the master bedroom in Gosling manor has been cleaned perfectly, leaving no traces of blood spatter or chalk, yet when he finds the CCTV viewing area and looks at it through the CCTV cameras, he describes seeing the outline of the body and the chalk on the floor. At another point, when he first meets Rebecca, she opens her mouth and he describes her mouth as having no tongue, only ulcerated gums, yet two paragraphs later her tongue is described as being coated and later she actually speaks. These sorts of things should have been caught and fixed well before publication.\n\nBut not everyone is likely to have noticed that, I suppose; it's just one of those things I noticed. There was also a comment that really started me thinking. Someone said, \"Apparently quite a few people who dabble in the occult top themselves.\" Weirdly enough, this sort of attitude seems to be fairly wide-spread, because I had a doctor tell me as much at one point. A lot of people seem to think that people who are involved in the occult or supernatural or consider themselves Pagan because despondent as a result (for some reason). I don't think that's the way things work at all. I think people who tend to be despondent about how the world is tend to turn toward the occult and supernatural and Paganism as a place to belong, as a place where they won't be constantly judged and have fingers pointed at them and told they are going to hell. I think these people are just a lot more likely to take their own destiny into their own hands and decide to move on to what comes next sooner out of a hope that it is better than the mess this world is in. That's what I think.\n\nAnyway, this is a book that is more focused on a male readership, I think. The pace is fast and the characters are developed, but the plot is mostly focused on action and not talking, and that's just fine with me. I really enjoy these sorts of stories, and I'll probably end up buying the final book in this series for myself to read before too much more time passes. In the meantime, I'll be moving on to the 2nd book in the series, Midnight, next.\n\nDisclosure: I bought this book for myself. All opinions are my own.\n\nSynopsis: `You are going to Hell, Jack Nightingale.' They are the words that ended Jack Nightingale's career as a negotiator with the Metropolitan Police. But two years later, when Nightingale is a struggling Private Eye, the words come back to haunt him. Nightingale discovers that he was adopted at birth and that his real father, a confirmed Satanist, sold Nightingale's soul to a demon from Hell. And on his thirty-third birthday - just weeks away - the demon is coming to claim its prize.", "summary": "Fast-paced and darkly humorous, but the content editing is sloppy", "unixReviewTime": 1365292800}, {"overall": 2.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2013", "reviewerID": "A3U7DDPTRUTBD9", "asin": "1444700650", "style": {"Format:": " Kindle Edition"}, "reviewerName": "Karen", "reviewText": "The first chapter was wonderful -- that's what sucked me in.\n  After that, the story goes downhill.\n\nAfter the first chapter, our protagonist, Jack Nightingale,\ngets off the hook for murder by simply not saying a word.\nWow, I bet a lot of convicted criminals wish they had known\nthat one handy tip!

I'm surprised that no reviewer here has yet pointed out the elephant in the room (well, one reviewer sort of mentioned it), but our elephant is right there and it's impossible to avoid it: You cannot sell somebody else's soul to any devil, from Satan down. Period. If there is anything most Christian religions agree on, is that. This novel's main idea is that a man has sold his not-yet-conceived son's soul to a devil and now the son, a grown man when we meet him, must try to lawyer his way out of a contract he never signed. Leather uses a lot of Christian paraphernalia and ideas to deliver a message that contradicts everything Christian doctrine teaches. Just think about it. If such a deal were possible it would be the religious equivalent of borrowing from the Mob and telling the wise guys that your neighbor, or your nephew, or Bill Gates will pay the debt, \"your\" debt. The Mob could take deals like that but it doesn't because it understands that such a business wouldn't work at all: there is a logic to extortion and the mafia is a business after all. And there is a logic to the idea of hell, Satan, his demons, and Heaven, God and His angels. You can't have Satan and his minions happily getting fat on souls that had nothing to do with the deal, even if those souls are corruptible, even if we apply the dubious medieval concept of Purgatory and babies who die unbaptized. What Leather, the author, does, is to take what seems like a good prop from religion (the concept of Good and Evil as metaphysical entities) and twist it to suit his novel's plot. But the whole concoction comes up burned on top and uncooked in the middle. Maybe he will explain this unholy mess in the next two books, and one way is to say that blood rules, that a father, genetically linked to a descendant, can, indeed, sell his descendant's soul to a devil. But that wouldn't save this novel or the trilogy from choosing and picking badly. One tenet that Leather ignores to the detriment of his book, and he does so because it demolishes the plot, is that people choose to sell to the devil or his minions the only thing worth pursuing, from a religious standpoint: their souls. They can't barter their children's souls away any more that they can barter what isn't theirs, because their children's souls are not theirs to barter. If we go the Calvinist route, Leather can't even write his book, since Predestination trumps everything and those who'll be saved will be saved no matter what a devil or Satan himself may want or do. And here we come to a very important point that Leather forgets in his very disrespectful romp through two thousand years of belief: this is about souls, not lives, so the stakes are infinitely higher. I am an atheist, but I understand Christianity, and one essential aspect of it is that God may seem uncaring at times, indifferent, or downright cruel to us humans, but He is never impotent, and He is never weaker than Satan and his minions. Remember, God \"made\" Satan and all the angels that chose to follow him in the Fall. Does it even seem remotely possible that the creator of Heaven, Earth, and the Universe, the one whose name Leather's characters invoke several times in the book, especially at the end when trying to communicate with a soul, would allow unborn children's souls to be carried away by the truckload by the likes of Azazel, Asmodeus, or, in the novel's case, Proserpine? Afraid not. It just doesn't work that way. When writing fantasy, if the writer forgets or ignores his own universe's rules, he weakens the story and may even fatally damage the entire book. Leather has chosen to write a fantasy novel using, badly, some concepts from established Christian religions, ignoring most of them, and serving us a bad attempt at the supernatural. But supernatural does not mean careless and free-for-all. The elephant is right there in the room and the whole house has collapsed around it.\n\nIf you enjoy supernatural thrillers that are well-written and deal precisely with Fallen Angels, demons, possessions, etc., look no further than John Connoly's books. Some are better than others, but all are much, much better than this sorry jumble of sentences, cliches, ideas and concepts that the author either hasn't studied or chose to ignore.", "summary": "No, you can't sell somebody else's soul, son.", "unixReviewTime": 1356912000}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "2", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2012", "reviewerID": "A1LV96NTF1I9SQ", "asin": "1444700650", "style": {"Format:": " Paperback"}, "reviewerName": "Roman", "reviewText": "There are hundreds of detective stories here on Amazon, this is one of the strangest.

That book description made it sound like it would be very interesting, but it also sounded like I might want to start the series from the beginning in order to have all the characters and basic story concept firmly in place.  I'm glad I made the decision because this novel was a good thriller with the delving into the paranormal aspect which made it slightly different.  Jack Nightingale was a member of the Metropolitan Police Force of London as a negotiator with hostage takers or potential suicides.  One of his cases caused him to resign from the force and for the past two years he has been a private investigator.  Jack is informed that his entire life has been based on false information when he is bequeathed Gosling Manor.  Now in just a matter of days Jack will reach a birth date milestone and a devil will arrive to take his soul.\n\nThe premise of the novel was quite intriguing and well plotted so that aspect was accomplished very nicely.  The characters are mostly good, although some are made to be a little too shallow for my tastes.  I'm sorry the author decided to sacrifice one particularly good character because that person really could have been of value in the remaining books of the series.  I thought Jack Nightingale's reaction to the deaths of all the many people who died in this novel was quite strange.  It was almost as if he had very little emotional connection with the deaths at all, no matter what his relationship to the recently deceased.  Although, I must say they all did give him another excuse to drink far too much and often and smoke far too much and often.  In fact, I got thoroughly tired of all the drinking and smoking.  As well as all the references to the 'MGB'.  Why not just call it a car?  Definitely call it a car more than twice in the entire book (as far as I can remember).  It was not a natural feeling way for someone to refer to the vehicle they drive.  I know absolutely no person who speaks of their vehicle by the make or even the model name on a constant, regular basis.\n\nMy main quarrel with this novel was two-fold:  the repetition of dumb questions which got dumb answers and the repetition of the discussions about heaven and hell.  Favorite questions occurred time and time again:  You aren't really going to do this are you?  You don't really believe all this do you?  You aren't really going to go there are you?  You didn't really do that did you?  All of which were answered by Jack with, yes I do, yes I did, yes I can, yes I will, yes I have.  Then there are at least seven episodes of Jack discussing with different people whether or not heaven and hell actually exist and where specifically they are -- as in a geographical location.  All of which ended up with exactly the same conclusion.  I understand that Jack was dealing with a devil who would take his soul which would leave him dead.  But to have the same discussion with so many people and come up with exactly the same conclusion each time was almost a deal breaker for me.  If the book had not been on my Kidle I might have been tempted to toss it across the room.  And to make matters even worse, there was repetition within the repetitiously themed conversations.  Holy guacamole!  I got to the point of hoping I wasn't in for yet another round of heaven/hell discussions only to be shown that my hope would be dashed on some tombstone.\n\nI am glad I read this first book in the series before starting the second because there is so much backstory and character development for Jack in this book that it will help me immensely with the second and possible the third book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Nightmare-Nightingale-Book-Three/dp/1612182313/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Nightmare (Nightingale: Book Three )</a>, due for release in the U.S. in November 2012.

I was looking forward to this one, since it marks the start of a series with potential: demons, a private investigator, missing persons and lost souls. But any book with horror as a major factor needs to show emotion, and lots of it. The hero, Jack Nightingale, seems strangely unaffected by events. His parents died tragically when he was 19, but it seems that he managed just fine: finished school, joined the police force, and so on. Now he's in his thirties and a private investigator, using his overdrawn credit card to pay his bills, and he's learned that in a few weeks a demon is coming to claim his soul. It's fine for him to greet this news skeptically, but as events pile up, each one worse than the last, he has to cross over into a realm where common sense doesn't apply. He's assisted by his secretary, but again, there's a lack of emotion - we're told that she favors him, but we don't feel any chemistry between them. Although there are physical descriptions indicative of strong feelings - like Jack awakening in a sweat from nightmares, or being startled in a churchyard and falling down from the surprise - I simply don't feel, or see, any deep emotions or internal turbulence.

Not wanting to jump into one of his longer running series, I picked up Nightfall which is the first of a trilogy of books based around Jack Nightingale (yeah, I know, not very subtle).  So with the character name setting a bad start, I grudgingly proceeded to read the book fearing I had stuck myself with some genre sludge written to tap the exploding reader interest in this area.  And in the blink of an eye, fifty pages had passed and I was hooked.  Huh, I didn't see that coming.\n\nTurns out there is a reason the author has received all those 4-5 star reviews, he really knows how to write a solid book, and does a particularly good job of balancing tension and plot advancement, while crafting interesting characters and realistic dialog.  All too often, books of this genre have dialog that is jarringly bad in spots (aka nobody talks like that in real life) or plot devices of the worst sort of Dues Ex Machina kind.  Leather does not fall into either trap.  Its clear the Nightfall series benefits from the author's experiences writing his previous books, as in the wrong hands this could have been a terrible book.  Instead, it ended up a well written, terrifically executed take on the genre.\n\nFor fans of the author- if you had not ordered already, feel free to go ahead.  You won't be disappointed.  For others new to Stephen Leather, I think this would be a great jump in point on a talented author.  While I wait for the next two books in the series, I will probably start working my way through his earlier works as well.

But no matter, Nightfall was exactly as advertised  - the story of how Jack discovers that his father had sold his unborn son's soul to a devil who would come and collect on his 33rd birthday.  Naturally,  Jack is not happy about this and does his best to stop this from happening as (almost) all his friends and family are dropping like flies all around him in the days leading up to his 33rd.\n\nThe writing was fine, and the pacing good.  There were fewer plot twists than expected and in truth this was more like a police or detective procedural than a heavy-duty occult fantasy.  Still, I enjoyed it.

Out of nowhere, Jack receives a message from his recently-deceased biological father: \"Sorry, kid, but I sold your soul to a devil. She'll be dropping by on your 33rd birthday to pick it up.\" That's just a couple of weeks away, so when people around him begin dying and random people start telling him \"You're going to hell, Jack Nightingale,\" Jack knows he has to take this crazy message seriously. But what can he do?\n\nThe Bad: Packed with cliche, and slow, slow, S-L-O-W. By the middle of the novel, I was wondering whether Leather was going to save Jack's 33rd birthday for the third volume in this planned trilogy. (Answer: No, fortunately.)\n\nThe Good: I'm not familiar with Leather's other work, but he's obviously a skilled and occasionally-thoughtful writer. Despite the torpid pace of \"Nightfall,\" he's able to maintain enough tension and mystery to keep his not-quite-bored-to-tears readers turning the pages. Jack's conversations with with clergy and others about death, heaven, and hell resonate, at least a little, and some of the atmospheric bits are well done. (That does NOT include the repeated scratching sounds Jack hears at his dad's house or the even more frequently repeated lamentations about how you can't smoke in bars anymore.) Most of the humor is hackneyed film noir banter, but it's still entertaining. And, finally, the book's conclusion is not half-bad: it resolves enough to satisfy readers but leaves enough up in the air to justify a second volume.\n\nAdditional comment: We know from the get-go that Jack's dad sold his soul to a devil (not THE devil, FWIW), and that the devil is going to be coming to collect it. Leather makes (almost) no effort to suggest that this is NOT what's going to happen. That being the case, to put off the inevitable until late in the book is (figurative) torture. Maybe Leather WANTED to frustrate readers. I don't know, but that's definitely what he does in \"Nightfall\".\n\nBottom line: This is an OK book. I read so little horror that I can't say how it compares to similar novels in the same genre. I can say, however, that it is both less exciting and less imaginative than kindred books in dark urban fantasy, like Jim Butcher's Dresden Files or Kat Richardson's Greywalker series. I wouldn't tell anybody to run out and buy this book, but if you're stuck in the airport and there's nothing else appealing on the shelves, you could do worse.", "summary": "Dear Abby: Daddy sold my soul to the devil.

Perhaps Leather is contemplating a new direction for the Shepherd series and is stalling for time vis-&agrave;-vis his publisher? Be that as it may, NIGHTFALL is an unexpected treat for those fans seeking a hiatus from the Spider adventures that are perhaps verging uncomfortably close on the too-predictable.\n\nHere, Jack Nightingale is a struggling London private-eye and a former member of the Metropolitan Police's elite CO19 armed response unit, from which he was forced out under a cloud after a suicide-prevention incident went horribly wrong. During his daily routine of catching-out cheating spouses, Jack now learns that he's been willed a palatial country home by a previously unknown man, Ainsley Gosling, claiming to be Nightingale's biological father. Why, the inheritance tax alone will ruin Jack's finances. And then there's the DVD, made shortly before Gosling blew his brains out with a shotgun, on which he apologizes for selling his son's soul to a devil at birth, the delivery due on Nightingale's thirty-third birthday two weeks hence.\n\nAs Jack resists belief and the last few days before the closing date trickle away, the bodies begin to pile up as relatives, a close friend, and assorted others meet horrible -- sometimes gruesome - ends.

Books by Dennis Wheatley come to mind as representative favorites of my youth, though such pretty much never transit my bookshelf now.

That is, until the last couple of chapters, when Nightingale's special talents as a hostage negotiator delivered the book into five-star range with a riveting conclusion.\n\nAt one point, Jack ponders whether or not a soul exists. Since the reader of any author of fiction may wonder how much the scribbler imbues the story's main character with his/her own traits, I'm left to speculate if Leather is pondering the existence and state of his own writer's soul as he ages. Does he perhaps think that selling it to his publisher in exchange for undreamed of wealth and power in the literary world too great a price?

There is even a surprising explanation for why it is called `Nod.' Although this is listed as a YA novel, it is just as enjoyable for adults, if not more so. Younger readers would possibly miss many of the subtle nuances of the work.\n\nAt first, the switching of viewpoint from omniscient to first person was a little awkward. Cole, the father of twins, is reading a book to them that is written by his father, Jake. The book he is reading is told in first person, and relates a tale from Cole's childhood. The portions featuring the `adult Cole' become scarce after the first quarter, though, making for a smoother read.\n\nI felt that having Jake write his book from a first person perspective, but relate in detail events he was not personally privy to, gave the story an unrealistic feel. Yes, the tale is a fantasy and, therefore, not realistic at all. However, this aspect leant a fictional quality that is negated later in the work.\n\nCole's explanation for why he did not call Jake \"Dad\", or something similar, was bothersome to me. The story did not really explain why or when Cole switched to calling his father by his name. I figured that he must have called him `Daddy' when a baby as the adults would have ensured this. His brother, Sean, calls Jake, \"Dad.\" So, the explanation Cole gives his sons seemed like something contrived by an adult to earn points with his kids, rather than something based in reality, especially given the story he reads to them with his father's part in it.\n\nAlthough the story takes place mostly in the `dream world', it is pointed out that Sean and Cole have physical bodies there and can be hurt or killed. However, when Sean breaks his leg, he still manages to run, jump, climb ladders, etc. I tried hard to overlook this and succeeded for the most part, thinking that perhaps his leg wasn't actually broken, just sprained or something. However, being told that Sean still limps as an adult reinforced the idea that the leg was broken.\n\nThis was a fairly fast paced novel with many action sequences. I especially enjoyed the stories injected into the storyline. They were a good fit and very interesting.\n\nOddly enough, my favorite characters were the cows from the trampoline scene.  I don't know why, but that image just stuck with me.\n\nCharacter Development: 4 Stars\n\nJake is a very well-developed character. The reader can really feel his emotions coming through. I have to admit that I found it difficult to feel much sympathy for a man who abandoned his children, but sympathy did come into play for him being a widower.\n\nCole could have been developed more as the reader really doesn't get much explanation for what he is really feeling. As a child, we understand that he loves his brother, but we don't get a feel for how this boy feels about having his mother die and being abandoned by his father. This is not expressed well from the adult Cole's viewpoint, either.\n\nSean is very well developed from the childhood view. I did wish that he would have made an appearance as an adult, but, even though that never happened, I was still satisifed with the development of his character.\n\nWriting Style: 4 3/4 Stars\n\nThe writing style of Mr. Marlowe had a wonderful flow to it that kept me enthralled throughout. The descriptions were vivid, bringing the dream world to life.\n\nAside from a very few dangling participles and awkward sentences, the structure was outstanding. The dialogue was realistic and engaging. The action sequences were also very nicely done with no confusion for the reader. I could actually see the action unfolding in my mind as I read (especially those cows).\n\nEditing/Formatting: 4 3/4 Stars\n\nThere were a few too many editing errors to refer to this as `professionally edited'; however, it did not fall very short.\n\nThe formatting was excellent.\n\nRating: PG\n\n-------------------------------\n\nFor more information and reviews, including commentary by authors, be sure to check out my blog.

Prather", "reviewText": "This is probably the hardest book review I'll ever write.  As an author myself I always preface my reviews with the information of whether I know the author or not.  I've \"met\" Larry Enright on Facebook, Twitter and a variety of other forums.  I love his wit and sense of humor.  I've interviewed him and didn't take offense to his comment that my writing career was inspired by a Rabid Dog (\"Old Yeller\").  And I'm not a professional reviewer.\n\nWhen I told Larry that I had purchased his book he emailed me and told me it was \"Different\", and he hoped I liked it.\n\nDifferent would be one way of describing \"Four Years From Home\".  Most people assume since I write dark, not-so-cozy murder mysteries that my taste in literature runs the gamut of James Patterson, Tami Hoag, Kay Hooper, Patricia Cornwell and other mystery writers with a penchant for murder and mayhem.  They would be right to a certain extent, but I also loved C. S. Lewis.  The first time I read \"The Screw Tape Letters\" I was amazed, thrilled and awed by a work of literary art so deep, and so exquisite  I almost felt I should chop off my fingers for even considering myself to be an author.  \"The Screw Tape Letters\" was different.  A book that inspired great passion in those who read it, and those who attempted to read it and burned it as blasphemy.  Growing up in the Bible belt I naturally assumed it would burst into flames as soon as I opened it, or at the very least I would be stricken with some horrible malady for reading such \"trash\".  It has a place of honor on my bookshelf as being one of the true literary arts of my time, and the exact opposite of what I was led to believe.  That's all I can say about it without giving you spoilers.\n\nSeveral years ago a movie came out called \"Sixth Sense\".  Millions of people watched this movie before I did, but out of millions of reviews not one person gave away the spoiler.  That fascinated me.  It was definitely \"different\".  And millions of people kept that secret religiously.  There were minor clues along the way, but so intricately weaved into the story that you missed them.\n\nWhich brings me back to \"Four Years From Home\".  A work of literary art which I believe will inspire passion within each reader.  You will love it - or you will hate it.  Or perhaps like me you will love it and hate it (which I can't say why without giving away a spoiler).  Within the pages of \"Four Years From Home\" Mr. Enright has weaved an intricate model of human hopes, dreams, fears, strengths and weaknesses.  The brilliance of the human mind, and the frailty of the human mind.\n\nTom Ryan is a Legend In His Own Mind.  Much like every child and artistic adult who grew up in an atmosphere that allows the imagination to develop and grow.  Reality is just a figment of our imagination to be bent, changed and shaped to our will.  But somewhere deep inside, perhaps at the core of our existence, deep within the soul lies a reality we cannot bend; we cannot change or shape to our will.  A reality we can only at best attempt to run away from and escape.\n\nI can't say more without giving away a spoiler, which is why this was a very difficult review to write.\n\nOVERALL BOOK - 4.5 Stars\n\nI gave this 4.5 stars instead of 5 because I found at least 5 typos in the book were words were omitted from a sentence and in one case transposed in a sentence.  For a debut novel this is minor, as my own traditionally published first book had 7 typos.  When I brought this to the attention of my publisher the comeback was, \"Patricia Cornwell's new book has 28 typos in it.\"  My comeback was, \"I'm not Patricia Cornwell.\"  As authors we have a responsibility to our readers.  As self-published authors that responsibility, in my humble opinion, increases.\n\nCHARACTERIZATION - 5 Stars\n\nYou are immediately drawn into the Ryan family through Tom's internal dialogue, and through interaction with his mother, father, sisters and brothers.  You're given a clear-- at least according to the legend-- concise \"picture\" of the family and their strengths and weaknesses.  They each become someone you feel you know intimately.  Especially Harry.  Sweet, special Harry.\n\n  Although some may consider this a backdoor approach into characterization, it worked for me.\n\nPLOT - 5 Stars\n\nThe plot is \"different\".  If you're a traditional mystery follower who expects certain things to happen in order, you may be slightly disappointed.  But the plot is unique.  A true literary art, as it is subtle, and perhaps somewhat hidden in the Legend's mind.  And the purpose of a mystery is to lead the reader down a path of intrigue, throwing out subtle clues and yet revealing nothing that will allow you to grasp the conclusion--therein, Mr. Enright has excelled.  I, as a mystery writer, applaud myself on being able to figure out early on \"what's going on\".  That didn't happen here.  I was tempted many times to move to the end of the book, but as with all books I enjoy I denied myself that pleasure and kept turning pages.  Searching for the clues that would reveal the end.  I was astounded.  I would never have guessed the ending.\n\nThis was a difficult book to review because I loved it, and I hated it, and I wanted to tell you why, but much like \"Sixth Sense\", that would reveal far too much.  You may find yourself a little irritated by Tom's obsession with (oops, can't say, because that's a spoiler), but if you like \"different\" then I truly believe you'll love this book.

I fell in love with Tory and Rye and their story was surprisingly good and a freebie to boot (and it's still free on Amazon).\n\nTory is a cook who's working her way through school. She's currently finishing up her dissertation for a doctorate in Anthropology. She lost her parents due to a car wreck at an early age and was raised by her grandparents. Tory's grandmother taught her how to cook but made her promise (on her deathbed) that she'd get an education (hence the doctorate). Tory's grandfather just died recently, leaving her on her own and with a lot of medical bills to deal with.\n\nRye is a Country star. He grew up in a blue blood southern family and got disowned when he left law school to pursue his dreams of singing country for a living. Rye is a bad boy and tends to party and sleep around.\n\nThe story begins with Rye being on tour and looking for a good meal late at night after he finishes with a show. He lost his last cook and found great reviews for a local diner so he shows up to get a meal. He finds that the food is awesome and that the cook is having money problems so he offers her (Tory) a position as his tour cook for an amount of money that will really help ease some of her pressing bills. Tory doesn't listen to country so she's not really a fan of Rye's. She's not sure if she really wants to be his tour cook but takes a chance since she could really use the money and has the summer off of school anyways. Since Rye lost his last cook after some sleeping around made her get pissed and leave, Rye makes it a condition of Tory's employment that she can't sleep with anyone on tour. Tory goes along with this because she's not the sort to sleep around and doesn't really see it as a possible issue.\n\nWhen things start up, Rye and Tory have some conflicts between them due to some publicity/tabloid stories (both good and bad) that cause some difficulties. Before too long though, Rye and Tory become friends, finding that they like chatting and having each other as company. When Rye's family issue become more pressing, he turns to Tory for support and this pushes them closer. Rye hasn't seen himself as having anything to offer a woman and therefor can't see himself getting seriously involved or married to a woman and Tory sees his reluctance in this area clearly. She's not willing to get her heart broken but things end up pushing them together and eventually they both let themselves go there. Things aren't perfect after that though and both external and internal issues end up causing drama that pulls them apart. Things look pretty bad for a while but Rye grows as a person and eventually realizes he can't live without Tory. He makes a great effort to get her back and although Tory was pretty positive things were done between them, she can't help but be touched by his actions and they're able to come back together in a very sweet HEA.\n\nI was very pleased with this story. I really liked both Tory and Rye. Tory was sweet and smart with a backbone as well. I liked that although she was sweet, that sweetness didn't come across as weak. Rye had his issues but the story showed enough of him under the bluster that you could see he was really a great guy underneath, he just had to see it for himself to realize he had something to offer the right woman. I also really liked his relatives (except his mother), especially his niece and nephew.

Blevins", "reviewText": "Country Heaven is book 1 in the Dare River series by Ava Miles. I simply loved this book.  It is adventurous, has a mystery, loads of romance, and lots of family interaction and forgiveness.\nRye Crenshaw has cut ties with his family, except for his little sister, Amelia Ann. Now his sister, Tammy, has come to him on his tour to ask him to come home as his Father, who had a heart attack, wants to talk to him.  Although he really sees no use, he heads home but takes his chef, Tory home with him.  He doesnt need her as a chef as much as a friend to help him get through with this visit.  He also doesnt want any publicity over this visit.\nWhen they arrive at Hollinswood, they find Ryes Mother has not relented one bit in her hostility towards Rye.  After all, he refused his place in the family law firm, and chose to embarrass them with his lifestyle.  Thankfully, he had changed his name from Hollins to Crenshaw, his grandfathers name. However, his Father is asking for reconciliation.  He shows Rye that he has all of Ryes CDs and tells Rye that he is very proud of him but ashamed of his own behavior towards Rye.  Ryes Mother lets them out after his talk with his Father.  He is to stay in the guesthouse.  Since this was where his grandfather stayed, Rye is not insulted as his Mother had intended.\nRye is soon reconciled with his sisters, Tammy to a lesser extent than Ameila Ann.  However, Tammy is more like their Mother than Ameila Ann is.  Tammy is married to a stuffy lawyer and has two perfect children and a perfectly spotless house.  She has conformed to the perfect wife and mother that her own Mother did.  However, she does what is expected and greets Rye and Tory nicely.  Tory and Rye quickly see that Annabelle and Rory are not happy but are definitely perfect children.  Tammy and the kids soon come around, Annabelle more than the rest.  Rory is especially standoffish to everyone.  Amelia Ann asks Rye for help talking to her Father about going to Vanderbilt and becoming a lawyer. She does not want to follow in Tammys steps and be a society wife.\nHamilton Hollins asks his son to run an errand for him.  While Rye is doing that, he sets out to visit Tory.  They get along great and are talking when Rye comes  home, his errand having been completed.  Tammy soon angrily follows.  She is angry at Rye for going to her husbands office and punching him.  When she turns to her Father for backup, she finds it was he who sent Rye to confront Sterling about his cheating on Tammy and sending a message that he is to stop now.  What they don't know is they have made Tammys situation much harder since Sterling also hits Tammy.  They adjourn to the main house for dinner and afterwards, Sterling appears having been invited by their Mother.  Hamilton tells Sterling he is not welcome here; but that they need to talk.  Tammy, Hamilton, Rye, and Sterling adjourn to the study.  Here, after being arrogant and saying some things about Tammy, Sterling says he will divorce Tammy for a million dollars.  Rye offers the money, Hamilton draws up the divorce papers as well as papers for complete custody of the children and Sterling who really didn't expect his price to be met, eagerly signs the papers.  Tammy is stunned but happy.\nWhen Rye returns to his tour, he and Tory continue their affair and plans are made for Tammy and her kids to move into Ryes home at Dare River.  Then the tabloids publish the terms of Tammys divorce and Ryes hand in it.  Tammy is horrified and Rye is angry and wants to know who talked.  Several hands point to Tory and Rye accuses her.  She claims her innocence and leaves for home as planned.  She is determined to finish her doctorial study.  This was the second time he accuses her of letting information about him slip and it will be the last time.  She won't be there to get any information.\nWho let the information out?  What will that do to Tammys divorce?  Will Amelia Ann be allowed to go to Vanderbilt or will Mothers plan for her win?  What does Torys leaving do to Rye and his career?  Will Rory come out of his shell?\nThere is so much more going on in the lives of Rye, Tory, Tammy, Ameila Ann, and Ryes parents.  I loved how complicated the plot of this seemingly innocent romance became.  Ava Miles has a talent for complicating their lives yet still seeing the end.  Her use of language is spectacular.

From his appearances in previous Miles' novels, I knew he was a good ol' boy who loved good food, but beyond that not much more. Without a doubt, I was curious and had a feeling that soon he'd be having his own story, but hadn't anticipated a spinoff series.\n\nQuite cleverly, Miles had placed his Nashville home along the Dare River, so what could be a more effective brand tie-in than Dare Valley and Dare River. However, reading Country Heaven, I wasn't thinking of branding or cute names, but was enjoying the freedom that Miles was having in telling the story of Rye and Tory Simmons, the gem of a cook he found in a roadside diner.\n\nRemember, I mentioned he loved to eat. Well, once initial prickliness was set aside and he experienced Tori's cooking, this graduate student soon had a job as his personal chef. Tori is a strong, salt-of-the-earth character who dispenses wisdom and love with every meal she prepares. Like her grandmother, whose recipes she wants to use to turn into a book, Tori's warmth and kindness is clearly evident. I love her take-no-prisoners attitude with Rye when she walks into him relaxing - along with a groupie - and when she refuses to wear the see-through apron that his former cook/mistress had left behind.\n\nIt was evident that there was romance to be dished up between Rye and Tori, but the journey to that point is what makes this book so fun to read - along with Tori's recipes that Miles includes. Before I even finished the book, I was planning what meals to recreate. (I guess I was not alone in this as Miles has published a stand-alone cookbook, see my review.)\n\nIn addition to the romance, Country Heaven also focuses on family - and what family really means.\n\nOnce again, I cried and laughed as I read Miles' story, but when I turned the last page a bit of happiness stayed with me. Yes, that's the true magic of reading an Ava Miles book, she shares her happiness with her readers and it's quite a wonderful gift to receive.\n\n(I received an eARC from the publisher through Netgalley for use in this review.)", "summary": "Miles dishes up some irresistible country love!", "unixReviewTime": 1407715200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2014", "reviewerID": "A200GQJX3V1XNF", "asin": "1495443043", "style": {"Format:": " Kindle Edition"}, "reviewerName": "Kathie Hall", "reviewText": "I loved this book so much I couldn't put it down.\nTory crawled right into my heart.

We went right ahead and built \"The Snatcher\" which is a beautiful robot and also teaches how to perform two actions with a one motor.\n\nAppearance:  browsing through the book I was very pleased by its overall graphic quality, which is probably the best of all the NXT books we own. The graphics are grayscale, nevertheless they are outstanding, both in layout, scale and resolution. No more magnifying glass required to build the models! The resulting building instructions are very similar and follow the same conventions as real Lego building instructions. In fact, if they were published in color, I could not tell the difference from original Lego instructions, as they come in any Lego original set. The programming is explained block-by-block, also taking advantage of the print quality, as do the diagrams and of course the text.\n\nContent: I wished we had this book when we started building NXT robots with my son a couple of years ago. It starts from the very basic and progresses to the more advanced topics. It engages the reader to go beyond the instructions of the models with \"discoveries\". This is a great learning method.\n\nConclusion: This book will greatly enhance the experience of any NXT 2.0 buyer. It goes way beyond the models that come \"bundled\" with the set. It will keep youngsters glued to the set, learning and having fun. I think any prospective NXT 2.0 set purchaser would do very well in purchasing the book together with the set.

Not only does the book offer a clear top-down beginning to end approach to both the NXT Parts Architecture and NXT-G Programming Language while combining this end-to-end approach with interesting projects of increasing difficulty, but he stimulates the reader with building and programming challenges to increase their skill at independent thought in robot building and programming.  Just how far and how thoughtfully Laurens' teaching approach goes is indicated by by his unique system of flowcharting/state diagrams which both provides the logical decisions involved in programming this system with a graphical correspondence to the NXT-G Programming language.\n\nI cannot recommend this book highly enough as an aid to using the Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0 robotics system, and bringing a\nnew generation of roboticists and engineers to a deep and intuitive understanding these sciences.

D. in education and have been looking for a good computer programming book for kids.  Based on all my years of experience with how students learn, I wanted a book that would teach programming concepts without making huge leaps from one concept to another.  I had bought another \"basic\" programming book before and chapters 1-4 were great and then in chapter 5, the leap was huge and any child trying to learn from it would get lost!  This book uses appropriate teaching strategies to help children understand the concepts in programming.  It links each concept to a real world example that the student can relate to (this is very important in the learning process.)  For example, when explaining the differences in programming syntax among languages in chapter 1 - a basic concept, it shows the parallel between that and the different syntax in 4 different spoken languages.  When teaching the idea of binary, it explains it as open and closed roads.  For each concept, there is a real world link which is the best way for children to learn.  The book provides codes from different languages although seems to use C++ mostly, however, the purpose of the book is not to teach syntax but concepts in programming.  It is the perfect book for someone to read before they start to code.  It allows them to learn about different data types, strings, arrays, functions, loops, recursion, etc.  Although code is given to demonstrate, the idea is to teach the purpose of these data structures.  The best approach would be to go through this book first and then pick up a book that actually has you start working with actual code and writing programs.  Although this book says Computer Programming for Teens, it could be used for any age student with enough maturity to and interest to begin learning programming.  Many kids are able to start learning these ideas much earlier than the \"teen\" years.", "summary": "Very well done, links concepts to real world examples", "unixReviewTime": 1364688000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2013", "reviewerID": "A2U54RR72RB0FC", "asin": "161552763X", "reviewerName": "Jerry_NYC", "reviewText": "Great quality item!

I had seen the Mighty Bright Orchestra Light, which is really nice and has 9 LEDs and is supposed to light up 4 pages at a time, but it is almost overkill for a stand light and costs about $40.  I was looking for something cheaper.  I looked at the Mighty Bright Encore, which has 6 LEDs but otherwise similar to the Orchestra, but even that was $35.  The Hammerhead appears to be the same as the Encore except it does not have a lip on the back of it, to keep the light from shining out into the audience I guess, so you'll have to be careful about aiming it so it doesn't shine out there.  If there is a real problem with light going where you don't want it, I figured I could put a lip around the back with a piece of gaffer's tape.  It doesn't come with a bag or the AC adapter either, which was fine with me because if I'm using a battery operated light it is because there is no AC available.  If I had AC I would just use a regular stand light and plug it in.  Anyway, it seems plenty bright for two pages at a time, in fact I think some of the time you could use it on the lower setting and it would be bright enough for most situations (there is a high and low light setting, which the switch toggles between the two and off) and I'm sure the batteries will last a lot longer on the lower light setting.  At $20 I figured if it doesn't last forever, or I drop and break it, or I leave it on a gig I'm not going to be too upset about it.

I also like that it's easy to twist and you can tilt the light to many different angles very easily.  Overall it's a good device, which works as advertised and seems to be a quality build.\n\nThe reason I think it's just 'OK' for my set-up is that in order to get full illumination of the keyboard, the light is right in my field of vision or at about a 45 degree angle about 8\" high.  Because the laptop I'm using has only the two USB ports on either side, I can't use the light from the back as one reviewer mentioned.  That might be a lot better.

Guess what I do for a living... The lights that are provided for this application always come up short. The old ones reached a billion degrees Celsius in about two minutes. The new LED lights that are pre-mounted in the vehicle are bulky and cast a laser beam style spotlight in the center of the keyboard, blinding you with the reflection off of G and H, and leaving you hunting for the other keys while travelling 70 mph. Neither had a long enough goose-neck to reach up and over the top of the screen, so you had to choose between blocking a portion of the screen with the head of the light or casting an eclipse across the keyboard with your hand because the head of the light was an inch over the keys. The Mighty Bright USB wasn't long enough for my needs either, but I knew that going into this. I ordered a flexible USB extension at the same time to make the Mighty Bright long enough to get up over the top of the screen and out of the way. The only place I could find one anywhere was soundprofessionals.com:  SP-USB-FLEX-2.\n\nI used a battery powered Mighty Bright book light in the past to light up my keyboard, clipped to the top of the screen. It was by far the best solution I'd found to the problem. Unfortunately I felt compelled to save the environment and save taxpayers money on batteries (and vehicle repair costs because I'd wrecked it trying to find the right keys when the batteries began to die) and purchased an adjustable voltage power adapter that plugged into the cigarette lighter. My Mighty Bright was dead within the week, and I don't think it had hit 100,000 hours...\n\nSince I had the 2 LED book light, I actually intended to purchase the 2 LED version of the USB light. I ordered this one by mistake. I realized my mistake as soon as I opened the box. A trip to Mighty Bright's website wasn't encouraging. The 2 LED version was clearly listed as the brightest USB light, and the single LED version was listed as, \"ideal for situations that require a dose of discretion.\" I literally printed the return form out and had the 2 LED version in my shopping cart when I decided that the cost and hassle of return shipping wasn't worth it. I figured I might have the occasional opportunity to use this one at home, so I opened up the packaging.\n\nI added the flexible extension to the light and it was the perfect length to go from my rear USB port, up the back of the screen, and out over the keyboard. The brightness was impressive and ample. It looked brighter than I remembered the 2 LED battery powered light being. The cast of the light is also perfect- it covers the entire keyboard evenly, and makes every key easy to read. I won't need to order the 2 LED version for work, this one is more than capable. I don't think I'd even order the 2 LED version to replace it if I decided that I wanted a keyboard light for my home laptop.

THIS model is excellent.  I've bought a few and reordered from Amazon a couple more batches.  The bendy part is very smooth so some people may have problems gripping it to adjust the angle;  I thought the bend action was great, as it's easy to bend into all sorts of nifty positions.  I even use a couple as handy hallway and bathroom night lights because they draw such an infinitesimal amount of power, yet they are bright as blazes and do not (so far) seem to degrade in output over time.  Best NOT to grab the head to do adjustment, as the head can be forced to spin on its mount.  That's not good, depending on the stress level of the wires inside the tubing, so don't do it.  When plugged in, it does not light up until you press the contact button on top of the lamp head.  It starts up full bright (2 LEDs) and if you press the button down again, then only the farthest up LED stays on.  The PRECISION LENS aims the two LEDs so perfectly, you cannot tell that there are two distinct LED's underneath.  All you see is very bright or bright.  One down-aspect of this design is that the light continues to stay OFF when power is withdrawn and re-applied.  So if you use it on your laptop/desktop computer, and you need to reboot the computer, the light will shut off on restart, and then stay OFF.  Fortunately the ON button is easy to tap on to re-ignite the LEDs, then YET another tap is needed to go down to \"bright\" output level, since \"very bright\" may be just too bright, if other people are sitting around you.  Lamp head measures 2\" x 0.75\" at widest point.  It's 0.50\" thick but the lenses and rubber switch cover bulge out about 1/32\" above and below.  The bendy tube is about 10\" by itself.  The USB plug body is 1.5\" long, not including the male portion of the USB connector.\n\nUpdate, September 18, 2014 -- I have several of these lights running several hours a day.  Out of 4 units, one has begun to fail electronically.  Both LEDs have lost about 50% of their output.  Since the failure is on each LED equally, I assume it's the electrical circuitry that powers the lamps.  This speaks to a possible selection of low quality components within the lamp.  I'll keep a close eye on the other units in the array, and we'll see if more lights fail.  For an item of this relatively low cost, the maker is likely aware that few people will spend $11 in shipping to collect on the one-year warranty of their $10 product.

This is PERFECT.  Illuminates the keyboard perfectly, and even has two settings, in case you want to dim it down a little more.  Handy switch right on the top of the lamp housing.  Fully bendable but sturdy neck means placing it at any angle is no problem, and it does not droop -- stays right where you put it.  I've tried many others -- closest I found to what I wanted was a battery operated clip on, by Energizer, the battery folks.  It worked great but only lasted about 12 hours, which is why I wanted a USB powered solution.  Highly recommend this.  Not a floodlight, but perfect for the immediate workspace, which for me is lighting up my keyboard so no eye strain when answering emails, etc., late night.  No glare from housing, and it can be positioned such that it doesn't disturb anyone else.  Thanks Mighty Bright!!!\n\n* UPDATE:  Jan, 2014 -- Wow, so if this light wasn't great enough already, I just discovered it can also be a completely portable lamp.

Totally portable, and after a week of nightly use, the portable power pack I'm using has barely had any drain on its charge, so, just for folks to know, this Mighty Bright is more than just a laptop lamp -- if you have (or want to get) any portable charging unit, just add the Mighty Bright to it and it's a lamp on the go!

I liked them both, but I give the edge to the TravelFlex.  Both devices use bright and efficient LED lights.  The light color is a bit blueish (as with all LEDs that I've seen), but both provide plenty of light for reading in the dark (and they double as flashlights in a pinch).  Both devices clip on to the top edge of your book or Kindle and have flexible necks that allow you to position the light in such a way as to illuminate the whole page without glare.\n\nNow for the differences: The XtraFlex has two brightness levels instead of one, but I did not find that I needed the brighter setting.  The XtraFlex also has a sturdier clip that is less likely to slip off of the book or (especially) a Kindle.  I found that the TravelFlex clip was adequately secure on my Kindle Touch, but I could knock it loose if I wasn't careful.\n\nThe TravelFlex beats out the XtraFlex, however, because of its size and weight.  I tend to hold my book or Kindle with one hand at or near the bottom edge.  The book therefore acts like a lever, magnifying the force exerted by the weight of the reading light.  I found that the XtraFlex, with its three batteries, made holding my book less comfortable than the TravelFlex, with its single battery.  The XtraFlex is especially difficult to use with a paperback book because it tends to cause the pages to bend backwards.

I found it at an artists supply store-it is a container designed for large paintbrushes.\n\n* The switch drives me nuts- I always seem to have trouble turning it on or off with just one hand.\n\n=== Summary ===\n\nFor not a lot of money, these things work great.

I recently bought 2 batteries for my Sony DSC-HX9V,\nI received the batteries promptly.

The second battery did the same but only showed 35 min when fully charged. It would cost almost as much to ship them back to you as I paid so to make me happy and change my review you can send me 2 batteries that have been tested out on my model to make sure they work like the OEM ones.

This way, I always have a USB data cable with me when I'm in my own car.\nI use the charger with the Samsung data cable that came with my phone and it works nicely, on both ports. CAUTION: The fine print on the front of the charger indicates the power available from each port and it's intended use. The bottom port is 1 amp and is the \"universal\" charging port. The top port is 2.35 amp and is intended for iPad. The more powerful top port does work with my Samsung Epic 4g but I limit it's use because it heats up the phone and the charger, and charging the phone's battery that fast is bad for it. Using the the bottom, 1a port, I'm able to use my phone's GPS feature without losing battery charge, so it at least keeps up. Using the phone for calls, the 1a port charges the phone while I'm using it. I've only used the 2.35a port once, in a serious pinch when my phone was dead.\nI'm not sure if it's intended to, but nothing lights up on the unit I have. I'm not sure if it's defective or if this is by design but it's not a huge issue for me either way.

The down side of that, however, is that it might be easy to lose. At the party, my cousin loved it and put it on immediately, and then the bow drive portion fell out and was temporarily lost in the yard within the first five minutes.
