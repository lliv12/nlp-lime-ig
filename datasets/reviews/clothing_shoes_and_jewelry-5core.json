I personally find it hard to accept why woman would just walk away and keep the baby a secret from the father even if he had wrong her, but that's just my personal opinion. Still, this story, while polished, just didn't grab me.\n\nBrice Henderson broke away from his controlling father to make his own fortune, by sacrificing everything, including the one woman he loved, but he can afford no distractions. When his personal assistant needed to take sick leave to take care of family, Brice reluctantly agreed to hire a temporary replacement... who turned out to be the one woman he pushed away... Lena Razzi. Lena spent years trying to forget Brice, despite having a daily reminder... a son by Brice that not even Brice knew about. Lena needed the job, even if it's just a temporary gig, to take care of the baby and herself, and Brice hasn't changed. But as they spent more time together, neither can forget the good times they once had. Can Lena tell Brice about their son if she's not staying? Can they rekindle their love... Or was this going to be a flash in the pan like last time?\n\nFrankly, I am tired of books that tout doormat single mom keeping the baby secret as if to spite the (bleep) dad just to prove you don't mean anything to me except as sperm donor, but as soon as they see each other, they got back together. It's basically formula that she won't tell him, believing this second time is temporary as well, then he found out and was pissed off, or he think he's damaged and was too good for her, or vice versa...

These are NOT those thigh highs.\n\nThese are a very sheer material, so I was worried they would easily rip or get runs in them, but I was able to successfully put them on and wear them for a few hours with no rips or runs.  Obviously they're still nylon and not indestructible, but they aren't cheaply made and going to run as soon as you put them on.\n\nThe 2nd thing that ruins thigh highs for me is when the elastic on the band at the top doesnt keep the thigh highs up.  I don't necessarily want the world knowing Im wearing thigh highs and I don't want to have to tug them up non-stop and these stay up very well.  Theres plenty of elastic on these to keep them in place and not have to constantly adjust.

The material is super soft and very flattering, and it's easy to nurse discreetly in this top. It did take me a few tries to figure out how to get from fully covered to latched without flashing people nearby, but I pretty quickly figured out what worked for me and my baby, and now I don't even have to mess with nursing covers, which is great because my daughter refuses to nurse when covered (and I can hardly blame her). I'm rather large-chested (I honestly don't even know my breastfeeding bra size... I was a 40D pre-baby and those bras are too small now), so I've had a hard time finding nursing tops that are flattering, comfortable, discreet, and modest. This shirt is all of those things. And that's why I have four of them. :)\n\nAt my family's huge Christmas Eve party this year, I couldn't find an empty room to nurse my daughter, so we just found a corner and nursed there (see pic for that outfit). My sister came up and started talking to me and it took her a minute to realize I was breastfeeding, rather than just snuggling my sleepy baby.\n\nI have several other styles of nursing tops and dresses, and this is by FAR my favorite.

Either way, I think it's really pretty.\n\nThe dress itself is soft and the color is beautiful (the lighting in my basement is fluorescent so it's not what you would call great for pictures) but it's actually a really deep purple that looks great with my skin tone.

However, a few things prevent me from rating it higher than three stars. First, even with the adjustable straps (which are nice), the chest area is way too low. I'm nursing (one main reason I purchased this dress - it works well for that purpose) and am guessing my bra size to be a 36D, and there is no way I would wear this without something underneath. I wear a nursing bra that looks like a v-neck undershirt under it and it covers better that way. Then I pair it with a shrug and it looks nice.\n\nThe other issue I have with this design is that it's advertised as being red and white. It is so far from being red. It's pink, almost hot pink. I love the floral pattern and birds and everything else about the design, but I was seriously disappointed with the color and never would have bought it had I known it was pink. I just wear a red shrug over it and that makes the pink stand out less without clashing too much.\n\nEssentially, it's a really nice dress if you know what to expect and work with it a bit. Not sheer (I tried a black bra under it and it did not show through), and very flattering.

Its also lacks the contrast of the greens on the mask.\n\nThe only pro's is that its a helmet, not a mask, and it has the dent in the top..and an antenna that leans to one side..Thats all the positives I can find.\n\nI do not try to find the negatives, but I find the mask is below expectations.

I wasn't expecting too much for the price I paid, so overall I would say that I got what I expected. The size stated on the outfit was 12-18 months. My daughter is on the small side and this was not big on her at all. At the time she wore it she was 13 months and wearing 9 month clothing.  The quality of the material is pretty low and tore easily during the only time she wore it. In addition, there is a medallion in the center of the dress by the neckline. The medallion is not secured very well and was constantly flopping around and getting in the way. Lastly, the ears that come with the costume are very flimsy and one ear constantly flops over. Overall, if you are looking for an inexpensive Minnie Mouse costume and don't play on using it too much, this may do the job. However, if you are looking for a costume that your child can wear multiple times, this may not work.\n\nCons:\n1) The costume is much smaller than the stated 12 to 18 month size. It fit my daughter who was wearing 9 month size clothes at the time.\n2) The material is not great and the material around the shoulder/sleeve tore slightly during first wear.\n3) The medallion in the center is not secured well and gets in the way.\n4) The ears are not well made and one ear was folded over.\n5) The buttons on the back of the dress don't secure it very well.\n\nPros:\n1) The price is low, but perhaps still a little too high for what you get.", "summary": "Cheap and cheaply made", "unixReviewTime": 1454371200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2016", "reviewerID": "A1JQMVVX1DKPZN", "asin": "B00001W0J3", "reviewerName": "Danny E.

For some reason I decided I needed a Stormtrooper helmet to wear with my Utilikilt. I know... an odd combination to some, but makes perfect sense to me. I started looking for helmets here on Amazon and found the one I wanted. Only problem was it costs $150. I actually put it in my wish list to ponder whether I'd be willing to part with $150 for something that I wasn't going to wear that often. Finally decided to go with the economy version and bought this one.\n\nFirst, as others have pointed out, the helmet that ships isn't the one in the photo. The black perforated eye areas actually have smoked gray plastic lenses (thankfully). Most everything else seems to be pretty accurate. Also, as others have pointed out, the helmet is in 4 pieces that don't stay together very well. You'll want some krazy glue or duct tape to make sure you're not fighting with it if you drop it or are a little rough on it. Even when it's put together I can see a bit of a gap on the seam that runs across the top. Not a huge deal as most people won't be able to see it, but it's there.\n\nI'd still like to have one of the better helmets, but until somebody smacks me on the bum with a golden spoon I'll settle for the $22 version. BTW, I also ordered a Stormtrooper white t-shirt (that looks like the torso of the stormtrooper armor) to wear with it.

I also wanted them to have a nice appearance and not look like dedicated work suspenders. These were the only ones to fit that criteria for me. The brownish burgundy color is very rich and the chrome buckles and hardware look nice and function well. I had no problem adjusting these suspenders. The range is accommodating from small to large. They can quickly be attached and removed once the loop attachments have been installed on your belt, by using the clasps, for bathroom breaks and such. Four loop attachments are included (one kit). I bought these for casual wear so I removed the heavy shoulder pads. The process is easy. (1) unbuckle both front straps. (2) slide the horizontal chest strap down and off. (3) slide the shoulder pads off. (4) reinstall the chest strap and make up the buckles. Done. You could also slide them off the back by removing the round strap guide (thing) which is how I did it because the chest strap was so tight, I did not think it was supposed to move. It has loosened up some. In the picture the horizontal chest strap appears to be riveted on, but on my suspenders you can slide it and adjust the height. It is tight and requires some force to move, so it does not flop down. I would have actually preferred a chest strap that attached with clamps (clamps that would not scar the leather). That way you could install and remove the chest strap fast, as desired. Mine uses leather loops for attachment. It seems feasible that these loops could loosen as the leather stretches to the point where the strap might fall down, but I could be wrong. They seem a little expensive, but there is nothing really to compare them with. When you actually break these suspenders down into their seperate components there is not a lot to them, but what are you going to do make them yourself (c'mon). They were delivered fast right to my front door by Fed Ex. They can be a little restricting but that is the nature of suspenders. I recently removed the chest strap which makes them a lot more comfortable, but now they have a tendency to migrate down my shoulders a little. They need semi-frequent repositioning. Removing the chest strap would probably not be practical for working applications. As these suspenders break in and soften I can foresee them becoming very comfortable. These are the first pair of suspenders that I have ever owned and I really like them. Everything that It wrote is truthful to Its experierce. This is only Its opinion.

There's no separate blow in for the top of the wings or the ends of the wings making it difficult to evenly inflate.  Overall... it's a cute accessory but not worth the buy.

Hill", "reviewText": "I decided to go with this costume for the Scarecrow in a recent high school production of The Wizard of Oz. Even though some of the other options here on Amazon were a bit more accessorized, I liked the color of this one enough to try it. The results were mixed, but more good than bad. I was happiest with the color, since it matches the character's outfit from the movie. We wanted to replicate the iconic look of the characters as closely as possible, and I think we achieved it with this Scarecrow costume. However, it took some doing to get there. First, the costume ran a bit on the small side, so we had to adjust. We added a generous amount of straw to the ends of the shirt and pants sleeves, adding the needed length and giving the costume a more authentic look. It was a simple touch that greatly improved the costume's appearance. The next problem is the hat. You won't be able to use the hat at all.

No sore spots on my feet after long days and in fact, my feet were not painful at the end of the day. Indicating to me adequate support at the arch and other pressure points. Because of the slight heel cup, my feet do not slip out of these shoes as they did in clog type shoes. This is a great safety feature, especially in a fast paced and sometimes messy environment. I normally wear the open foot pattern size and these fit well. No extra room though, so if you have particularly high arches or wide feet these may not work for you. But definitely give them a try. I wear thick socks with mine for additional cushioning. The shoes are quite firm but, not as much as traditional Birkenstocks.  Although made of vinyl/plastic material do not compare these to the feel of \"Crocs\" There is no comparison to the springy nature. That being said, they are far superior in support.

Titanium is lighter and stronger than regular steel and once you go Titanium, you won't go back.\n\nThis watch has a small face so its perfect for people with average to small wrist sizes.  Some of these watches have faces that are so big its like wearing a tea saucer on your wrist and it's an eysore.  This watch is a revelation to smaller wrists everywhere.  Also the band on this watch does not grab your wrist hair (VERY IMPORTANT!).\n\nOne disadvantage of this watch is the lack of features.  Its got the date and thats about it.  Also the ticking from the watch is loud enought that you sometimes notice it if the watch is within about 2 feet of your ears and the room is silent.

I often pick it up off the nightstand and toss it across the room.  Can't hear it unless it is dead quiet and within a few feet.\n\nClasp: After a few years, I had to adjust the catch on the clasp, since it started coming loose (I wear it pretty tight).

Also you better keep your sales receipt even though they have lifetime warranty.\n\nI sent in my replacement band and battery with payment for two watches in July and they cashed the check and didn't receive anything until January.  I called them and they promised to send a free battery, but when I received the items finally in March, no battery was included (let alone a free one).\n\nOther issues:\n\na) Wire mesh bands: The clasp is not always tight and over time will slide and get a little loose. Also the titanium mesh is made of tiny small circles of metal interlocked and if one of them gets open (say you hit something), it starts unraveling slowly but surely.\n\nb) Leather band: The one I have fell apart so quickly it is surprising. It also started smelling bad due to sweat (I do not sweat that much and I owned other watches with leather bands). This seems to be a very bad quality.\n\nc) Water - my watch started fogging after 2 years of light usage.\n\nI will NOT buy another Skagen watch.

It is by far the best watch I've ever had.  It is so light you don't feel it on.  It's great if you are a cyclist and want to reduce every once of weight on your bike. Quite literally, it is about 1/3 the weight of an average steel band watch. It has a sleek profile compared to most steel band watches so rarely gets snagged on things while doing work.  The face is also smaller than most  comparable watches.  About 1/2 way between a normal man's size watch and a womans watch.  I personally like the color of titanium over stainless steel and have received compliments on this watch for that reason.  It is fairly scratch resistant.  I am very abusive with my watches.  I wear them 24 hours a day even while working or in water.  I do a lot of hands on woodwork etc.  I've drug the face across some sharp metal stuff and this has put some light scratches on the face.  Under normal use I suspect it would not get too scratched up.  The band rarely comes unlatched even if you do happen to snag it on something.  The pins have never bent or come out, ever!  I think the titanium latch has better wear over stainless steel watch bands. The pins are probably also made of titanium.  It don't know for certain but given the fact they've never come out I assume so.  Titanium is much stronger than steel.  The band itself is very smooth and comfortable.  It never pinches the skin or feels irritating.  The reason why I have had 2 now instead of one is that I crashed on my road bike during a 30+ mph sprint and it was drug across 10 feet or more of pavement after an initial hard impact.  That broke the face of the watch and put some deep scratches into the titanium but the band never broke or came off.  The hands were still good.  If I remember correctly I think the watch was still working after all that until I started messing with the hands on it.  I paid $100 for it both times.  Now that I see they are a lot less on Amazon I think I'll buy another so if I eventually lose or break this one in maybe 10 years from now I'll have another to replace it.

You'll see some of the bands have little arrows on them.  These are the ones you can remove.  Do NOT pull on the outside portion of the link - it does not slide out.  You need to place a small pointed object (like an awl) into the hole next to the arrow and use it to push out on the inside piece.  This is a U-shaped piece.  You can slide it out a few millimeters, then carefully grab it with a small pair of pliers and pull it out the rest of the way.  (once its out a little ways, you can slip the awl back into the slot and use that to pull it out the rest of the way... I found that easier)\n\nOnce you get two (or more) of them apart, you can remove the other link parts and put it back together.\n\nNOTE:  This is a bit tricky and you have to be careful not to scratch anything.

I was looking at this costume out of curiosity, to see if I could buy the dress/cape part only.  It seems that I cannot and that it may not be as good as the costume that I rigged up on my own.  I think that some reviewers were unhappy with the hat that comes with this costume, as well as some others who wanted only the dress/cape piece.  I think that the hat that was originally sold on Amazon is wonderful.  It needs some stabilizing (minimal adjustments of the chin straps, typical with good headpieces).  I made the outer cape out of a black cape that I found at GoodWill, and I added some purple remnants from fabric store to wear as the inner piece.  I found a short burgundy dress from a clearance aisle at Target which made for a good under piece as it's cold here late October.  Interestingly, when I went out trick-or-treating with my niece. who was 11 at the time, she said, \"Aunt Marlie, you look scary.\"  I found a large fleece, green/black/purple polka dotted  jacket at GoodWill, and I had some black loose pants. I also had one of those crazy scarves that women were wearing a few years back, all ruffled.  Now, I can wear the hat as a part of a clown costume when I'm with kids, as well as becoming scary Maleficent when at adult parties.  I'd say, buy the good hat, if the reviews are discouraging to you in terms of the whole outfit or if you like the ways in which I use the hat for costuming.  If you like to have fun by making some of your costumes on your own, the head piece gives it a professional finish, while you get to create the rest.
