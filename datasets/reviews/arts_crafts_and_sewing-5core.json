If you knit and love to accumulate guides, stitch dictionaries, pattern books and design-your-own project books, this is a great resource. I find I'm always adapting knitting patterns slightly or significantly to swap out cables, add interesting borders so I can knit edges and body at the same time, what have you.\n\nThis gives you enough classic stitches to satisfy but its strength is in fresh twists on the usual or entirely new (at least to me) options in textured, lace, cables&cross stitches, slip st., and novelties. As others note, the stitches are arranged from simplest to most challenging in each section-- also a great help when deciding how much sweat and tears I'm wiling to expend.\n\nThis also does not frustrate me in the ways too many other books and guides do.\nHere, Leapman uses the symbols common in knitting magazines and most books on knitting you've seen. Yay!\nOne of my peeves with some designers and guidebooks is the use of their own symbology for charting various stitches. Alice Starmore leaps to mind as a woman living in her own private Idaho filled with her own Runic symbols. I have to translate her every chart's cable squiggles into the symbols I'm more familiar with just to get the thing going. Gorgeous end results, but geez.\n\nThis is concise but full of options, so I FIND something nifty quickly and easily.\nWhile I do love browsing Barbara Walker's stitch books, sometimes I'm just looking for a simple option and don't want to spend all day combing through umpteen volumes, each of which has its own section for lace, k/p, cables, slip st.s, panels, etc. I wish Walker would compile all her lace, all cables, all k/p, all color work, all panels, etc into huge sections in just ONE encyclopedia.\n\nUntil that happens, this is my new go-to for fast, interesting ideas to enhance my knitting.\n\nThis is not a great resource for traditional knitting stitch patterns, such as gansey (guernsey), it's perhaps best for 'modern' classic knitting.", "summary": "My current favorite go-to guide for inspiration", "unixReviewTime": 1439337600}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "3", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2015", "reviewerID": "A278N8QX9TY2OS", "asin": "0449819906", "style": {"Format:": " Paperback"}, "reviewerName": "Just us", "reviewText": "Great book but the index is terrible.

Yes, there are old favorites here, but the depth of new stitch techniques and ideas of how to work them into patterns has really helped to round out my large, huge, library of stitch encyclopedias. While some lace is covered, it is not a huge book of lace designs. The world has many. They are needed, but I don't make much lace. If you want reverse stockinette, cables, texture and strong fabrication, this is a great book.\n\nAll patterns are charted, as well as written and the colors tabbing the section make sense. There is little on, \"how to do basic stitches,\" taking up page space. While that information is important, I find the redundancy of the simple knit and purl to be a tree-wasting effort to round out some books, which would be better off without them. If you cannot knit, nor purl, perhaps this is not the book to start with. Which is fine! It's part of the journey of knitting. There is no end to this road of interest and there should not be, Texture, working patterns into garments and general beauty with color photographs, that are not over-the-top, but show the finished pattern in good light, are the hallmarks of this book.\n\nIf you knit can you exist without it? Well, of course. If you want to get a book with stitches I've not found elsewhere, then this is a must own. So much so, that after buying the edition for my Kindle, I got the book. I can't leave an entire sticky notepad's worth of paper in my Kindle. I can in the book and that's what I've done to this book. It sits in my pile in my studio space, within reach at all times. Right next to my Barbara Walker books and Vogue stitch dictionaries. I use it daily and make up swatches often, just to get a feel for them and to learn. Anyone who wants more will find this book a great resource. This is all my own thoughts.

Donnelly", "reviewText": "Here's the review I also have posted on my blog, Polymer Clay Review [...]\n\nYes, another 5-star book. Are there books I don't like as much? Yes. Have those been published lately? No.\n\nIt has been a decade-yes, a decade-since Donna published her first book, The Art of Polymer Clay. This second book takes us to Donna today. Her style is elegant, her techniques are innovative, and her instruction makes her projects accessible. I've taken two classes from Donna. In fact, I joined my local clay guild when I first started claying just to take Donna's class-and I haven't looked back.\n\nDonna's book is like a portable Kato class. Donna taught many of these techniques in the classes I took from her. However, having this indispensable reference book enables me to review the class at my leisure and further experiment with her techniques. She approaches each technique in a straightforward manner-teach techniques, then apply them to a project. This enables us not only to complete a sample that masters the technique, but also a very beautiful finished piece that will get people talking.\n\nDonna splits the book into seven different sections:\n\n  * Polymer Clay Basics\n  * Mica Shift Techniques\n  * Transferring Images Onto Polymer Clay\n  * Creating Texture\n  * Paints, Inks and Pigment Powders\n  * Special Effects with Liquid Polymer Clays\n  * Sculpture and Mold Making\n\nI love Donna's techniques. They are the result of hours of experimentation and development on her part. The book details both how to do something-and why. For instance, Donna makes a mold from her rubber stamps using polymer clay and THEN uses that mold to create her pieces. She goes into detail about why she does this, and what the results are molding directly from a stamp versus taking an impression from a polymer clay mold made from a rubber stamp. It's something I never considered, but it makes great sense.\n\nThe twelve beautiful projects are accompanied by step-by-step instructions and photographs that walk you through each major component. While some projects are simple, others teach you techniques in constructing complex pieces like her coveted Japanese Inro boxes.\n\nPeppered throughout the book are awe-inspiring inspirational pieces, including the pieces submitted for two of Kato Polyclay's artists contests/exhibitions-one focused on shoes (Feat of Clay) and one focused on boxes. I was honored to be the 2nd-place winner in the box contest, and my \"Donnelly's Sampler\" is included in the book.\n\nThis is yet another book that will stay in my permanent library.

Just got my copy today and it exceeded all my expectations by a long shot!  I seriously was only interested in the milk can block after I saw a quilt made from the pattern online but I had no idea all the blocks in this book were designed for both 6\" and 12\" blocks so if you didn't want to make a whole quilt, you could take any of the 6\" blocks and use them to make potholders which is just about the only thing I really have time to make right now.  I also loved the mason jar block which I've seen in one of her stand alone quilt patterns so it was a bonus to get this in the book as I didn't already have it.  Lori did a fabulous job pairing the fabric colors to each block theme and tying together all the block themes into farm related  motifs.  She has managed to design quilt blocks that I would think would normally be approached through paper piecing with simple squares and rectangles to get the most charming shapes like cherries, barns, little chicks, etc.  If you are a Lori Holt fabric collector you will get a big kick out of seeing many of the prints from her fabric designs in the blocks as well which really inspired me to want to pull out some of my fabrics to get started on my favorite blocks.  Although there are no sewing, knitting or other needle art themed blocks in the book which would really be a nice addition to the farm house/home made lifestyle theme of the book, there are plenty of prints with sewing motifs in them which made it extra special to me.  I noticed Lori used her classic color palette that she used in her last book Quilty Fun, but has added more grays and newsprint fabrics which I thought was awesome, giving the look a bit of a contemporary feel to it.  The other plus I found that I loved in the book is that most of the squares are based on 1/4\" and 1/2\" increments, only a few required cutting squares in 1/8\" increments which are more challenging for me to get accurate cuts (I rely on Accu Cut and Sizzix quilt dies quite a bit for my cutting which are all based on the 1/4 and 1/2\" increments).  I seriously cannot believe the huge amount of work that went into the making of this book.  It was well worth the price, there is just so much in there, it is jam packed with not only the blocks but many quilt patterns as well.  Well done Lori, so proud of you!  I know the Fat Quarter Shop sponsored a sew along online using this book so you can do an image search on Google to get a really good sense for what people have done with the patterns.  The theme of this book is so timely as more and more people are re-embracing home gardens, farm fresh produce, and our connection to the farmers that grow our food and yet the theme is also very authentic for Lori as she was raised on a farm as her parents and grandparents were so there are some very precious vintage black and white photos in the book that are just adorable.  I never knew that about Lori, it was fun to read a bit about her childhood growing up on a farm!

There are also many different needlecraft types used for the different purses, so whatever your favorite type of needlecraft, you can find a purse to make. There are purses made in leather, cloth appliqus, crocheted, needlepoint, etc. The bags come in every size too, from larger tote style bags to tiny purses that you can use for a necklace.

All of the patterns are inspired by natural forms found in nature The author, Norah Gaughan, in the introduction, states that she has \"always been torn between simultaneous desires to study art and science\". This book is a good example of how she combines the two and creates beauty. As Norah's life progressed, she realized that what she truly loved was knitting and wanted to make a career as a knitting designer. \"The work in this book feels like the melding of my science - and art-loving selves...\". \"Some of the designs in this book are structurally similar to nature's example.\" This can be seen by the chapter headings themselves. \"In some cases, the structure of the natural phenomenon dictated the structure of the garment (the garments made from hexagonal and pentagonal pieces, for instance). In others, the pattern from nature become a surface decoration imposed on the grid of knitting...\". \"In all cases, working within the framework of six categories of patterns found in nature freed my mind to look at things differently and allowed me to rethink the structure of garment-making.\"\n\nMany of the patterns are eye-catching and lovely. In Hexagons, the Asymmetrical Cardigan in a lovely light blue hue is definitely a pattern I want to try. It is knit in cashmere . The stitch in this cardigan is modeled after the woven pattern of caned chair seats. The Hex Afghan is stunning. Knit in a rich brownish-red, half alpaca and half wool, it contains rows of elongated hexagons.\n\nThe Swirled Pentagon Pullover is luscious. Knit in an angora and wool blend, it is an almost turquoise colorway. The top of the pullover has swirled pentagons and the bottom of the sweater is knit in a classic stockinette stitch. The Bubble Pullover is knit in a lovely violet color out of baby alpaca. It has large pentagons as its motif.\n\nThe Spiral Scarf is very 'now'. Its contemporary feel is obvious to the knitter. It is knit with Mongolian Cashmere in a golden and blue hue and is comprised of spirals attached together. The Cabled Spiral Pullover is knit in a light blue colorway from extra fine merino DK. There is a spiral motif on the top and the bottom two thirds of the sweater is knit in stockinette stitch.\n\nThe Roundabout Leaf Tank is knit in an ivory hue with silk yarn. \"The seater is made out of a spiraling strip, in the same way that leaves grow on a stem.\" The Phyllotaxis Scarf is perfect for a man or woman. Knit in a brown colorway with a wool, mohair and silk combination yarn, it is reversible. The scarf is knit in a tube to make its reversibility possible. \"There are five spirals slanting to the right and eight spirals slanting to the left so the pair from the Fibonacci sequence is 5-8.\" I love the Sunflower Tam. There are two examples in the photograph. One is green and the other yellow. They are knit with Icelandic wool. \"For this tam, I wanted to make a disk with two opposing spirals, like the phyllotaxis of a sunflower, daisy, or coneflower.\"\n\nThe Fractal section has several nice patterns. I really like the Branching Aran Guernsey knit with wool. \"I purposefully incorporated some traditional elements of the British guernsey into this design - the drop-shoulder shaping and the simple ladder pattern between the columns of the cables - and like the way they play against the naturalistic, very modern, branching cables.\" The Serpentin Coat, knit in browns and blues with merino wool, is perfect for an autumn day. \"The sinuous motif used on the yoke of this coat is a Dragon Curve, another mathematical fractal.\" The Triangle Scarf is in a dark beige and knit with a combination of nylon and rayon yarn. It features triangles based on a mathematical fractal called the Serpinski Triangle.\n\nThe Wave section of the book has several lovely patterns. I really like the Vortex Street Pullover in a green/brown blend knit with cotton. \"A phenomenon of fluid dynamics, a vortex street is an organized pattern of spirals formed in the wake of fluid flowing past a solid object.\" The center of this pullover has a wave section with stockinette surrounding it. The Reflection Aran Pullover is knit in a deep wine color out of wool. \"Inspired by the rule of wave reflection, the cables in this pullover 'reflect' off of the edges of the center panel.\" The Droplet Hat is another Aran pattern knit in a green colorway with wool yarn. \"This design is based upon a photo showing a droplet of water speeding downward propelled by gravity, spewing off little droplets as well as a narrow trail of water. My interpretation is rendered in bobbles and embossed leaves.\"\n\nOverall, this book is a real winner with clear photographs of the projects and easy-to-read pattern instructions. Some of the photos are a bit sexist for my taste but I can overlook that. They just seem silly.

First, she dresses up the conventional 6-pointed star with 7 patterns that incorporate borders, stacked strippy units, and even applique (making for a very Dresden-like star).  Next, triangles morph into flowers with 2 unique designs.  Cline ends with two Pinwheel-based projects: one is embellished with buttons and the other has a vivid tessellating appearance.  Each project includes a short \"Life Lessons\" box illustrating the huge influence on the author of her Mennonite family.  Photographs are in abundance, and highlight the exceptionally nice quilting details.  Both traditional and contemporary quilters will find something very pleasing here.\n\nAs for skill level, my opinion is that this book might be a challenge for some new beginners, as there are templates (included) and Y-seams;  precision piecing skills will be a must.  But I still recommend this book for all skill levels, as I remember when I first started out I went straight to the tough stuff so I could learn everything all at once.  (In retrospect, perhaps that approach is not recommended!)  Additionally, an endless supply of fabrics - or friends with fabrics - would be helpful because each quilt allows wonderful opportunities to play with value and contrast.\n\nThis book is set apart from all the rest, and not just for its beautiful contents.  Budget-conscious quilters might like to know there could be an extra ruler, an additional tool, and new products in their future:\n\n1.

I was hoping I could use the Clear-View Triangle I already own, but no.  The CG triangle is longer (and thus wider at the base) than the CV one, and most importantly the CG also has a differently configured tip.\n2.

Materials - 108-inch wide black nylon netting (used as an overlay to create an amazing receding effect in several projects), batiste (for triangle foundations), 20-inch wide double-sided fusible web (Ms. Cline uses Shades SoftFuse which will add significant cost to your projects:  each 8x9 inch segment is about 1.00 per piece)\n\nMs. Cline is also the author of another absolutely stunning book&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Star-Struck-Quilts-Dazzling-Diamonds-Tradiational-Blocks-13-Skill-Building-Projects/dp/157120959X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Star Struck Quilts: Dazzling Diamonds & Tradiational Blocks; 13 Skill-Building Projects</a>.

It has some great information and features that some other journals wouldn't have.\n\nThe typical Moleskine strap helps keep miscellaneous notes stored in place inside, and an accordion pocket in the back helps with that as well. It comes with a couple of sticker sheets to allow you to mark off certain recipes with \"love this!\" or \"what if...\" or more. There's also a sticker sheet of categories that you can use for the pages with blank tabs (\"My Favorites\" or \"Cooking Courses\" or \"Websites\" or \"Table Setting\" or \"Veggie/Vegan\") but you can always write in whatever other categories you'd like instead (I've written in \"Frosting\" and \"Miscellaneous\" in mine but find the sticker idea clever and they have lots of options).\n\nThese blank tabs, however, leave something to be desired. As other reviewers have mentioned, they don't mimic the style of the pre-set categories with spaces for the recipe title, ingredients, preparation, how many it serves, difficulty of the recipe, etc. The extra tabs are just blank spaces with randomly spaced lines to separate ideas (which I just usually ignore anyway). Regardless, I'm glad they have blank space, because some of the pre-set categories (like \"cocktails\" for me) just don't get used, while I require a lot more space for things like types of frosting.\n\nThe front of the journal comes with a lot of cool information (though I can't admit I use it all that often) such as a calendar of when certain food products are in season (and there are even separate calendars for the Northern and Southern hemispheres). There are food facts (such as calories, carbs, protein, and fat in common foods) and a conversion chart.\n\nOne of the more cool parts that I hadn't even noticed until several months of using this journal is there's a mostly blank index in the back so you can fill in your recipe titles and have an easier way to find what pages things are on later.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty great recipe journal.

I will probably make up my own sections instead of using theirs since this will primarily be for the bakeshop.  I think the star rating will be great for me since the recipes here will be my own.  A few folks have commented on how little space they have for writing recipes.  Number one, it's a recipe, not The Great American Novel.  How much space do you really need?  Number two.  Okay, so you really do need that much space.  Well, why not cross-reference a page in a later section.  All of the pages are numbered.  On the bottom of the page you find so cramped, write in \"continued page 123\" and continue on page 123!  I don't mean to be (that) snarky, but it seems obvious especially when so many of these same people claim that the later sections seem to be useless.  In the later sections, I may write in different flavor options for ice cream or cookies, different garnishes or plating options, etc.\n\nI don't see the point of copying all of my recipes that are already written into this book.  I do think this is great for anyone, chefs especially, who do any sort of menu development or recipe writing.  I LOVE the index.  That's too cool.  It will make it very easy to find information later.  My only complaint is the cocktail section.  I could do without it.  C'est la vie.  I'll most likely use it as another recipe section.

We live in a world where not too many of us can find the time to write down their thoughts, with a pen and on paper but, again, the Moleskines aren't for everyone. To the extent that there are people who not only love to write but love to write specifically about the movies they watch, the Passions series Film Journal is a notebook dream come true. But, let's examine what one gets.\n\nFirst and foremost this is a Moleskine, and it's very much true to its tradition of look, feel and quality. It comes with the traditional and most useful elastic band, nice cardboard binding that allows it to lie flat when opened without cracking the spine, excellent quality paper, rounded corners, THREE ribbon bookmarks and the 2-pocket mini accordion file inside the back cover.\n\nNow, this being a Film Journal, it includes a listing of a few dozen major film festivals, sorted by continent and location, an event planner, personal tabbed pages under half a dozen tabs with preprinted tab stickers to be found inside the accordion file. The main section is, of course, the movie journal. Alphabetically organized, it provides one page per movie with sections for recording the movie's title, country and year, awards won, directors, actors, quotes, notes, opinion and rating. For a movie lover who loves to write, can't get much better than this.\n\nI love this notebook for its quality make, its design and for its familiar look and feel. But I am repeating myself.

This might  have happened to others who bought this item and complained about the same thing. The product does come with a free 9924, but it's a small piece. They placed it within the plastic packaging. Therefore, if you unwrapped it and threw away the plastic, you also threw out your free piece. See the picture for more details.\n\nI tried it...it works great! It's a bit difficult to switch out the engraving points. The screw holding the piece in place is very small so you have to be careful not to drop that sucker. You sort of need a special, small and strong screw driver to remove it, so be aware of that. Also, I suggest to remove it on a table with a cloth on top so if you do drop the screw you can find it... I'm calling it a screw because that's the only name for it...But that this super tiny...can't stress that enough. I'm new to this game, but I have a feeling I'll be using this thing a lot! Great for the price!\n\nI just received it, therefore I haven't tried it. However, how can I try the machine when it is missing the tip. \"The included 9924 carbide engraving point ensures precise result.\" > NOT INCLUDED\n\nI plugged it in and it makes a very loud noise.

These are oils, the chemistry is only changed slightly to have a \"tail end\" which is water soluble; once the colors dry the oil remains and it has the same chemical features of standard oils.\n\nHOW to use: Painting with them you can use water (see other reviews, can make it look \"gouachy\") or you can use one of the many media from Artisan.  Cleaning the brushes with soapy water is easy and fast.  Keep in mind: Once these paints dry they will not be water soluble anymore. For plein air you don't have to carry solvents just find a water source and also for keeping palette and brushes clean all you need is water and they are environmentally friendly!\n\nCOLORS in KIT: The kit has a great palette but is missing a warm red so you may either have to change a bit your color schema or buy a cadmium red hue separate from the kit.

It seems that for the same brand they are different qualities or different painting series due to the pigment concentration.

However it is thick but you can use water, which works perfectly, or a non toxic diluent from the same brand to obtain thinner layers (diluent is not that cheap but fortunately you need only a few drops to obtain a very satisfying result). It is better to start with thinner layers because it takes a few days to dry, even if it seems a little bit faster than \"normal\" oil painting (at least it is my impression but it should be verified)so be patient! Once you have finished to paint, you just have to clean your brush with soap if you want it to last longer...\nI am still experimenting the product in order to be more familiar with it but I must say that with mixable oil painting you do not want to switch back to oil painting. In general, I think that water mixable oil has all the oil painting qualities without its big disadvantage: in effect, no strong odor, and consequently no headache, and no allergy anymore...it is safer  for human and animals and more, it is a good attitude/gesture for our beautiful planet!

At under fifteen bucks right now it can't be beat. The case is nothing amazing, but adequate. It includes a lovely little travel paintbrush. I think I paid six dollars for my other tiny brush like this all by itself. It's a really great (but very tiny!) travel brush made by Winsor & Newton as well. The colors included are really nice. I'd previously purchased a more expensive set similar to this (like, twice as expensive) and didn't like it at all. In fact, I'd decided to cross W & N off my list altogether, but kept hearing from so many people who love them, even the student grade Cotman line, that I thought I'd give it one more shot when I found this set so inexpensively.\nColors:\n2 yellows:lemon yellow hue, cadmium yellow hue,\n2 reds: Cadmium Red, Alizarin Crimson,\n2 blues: ultramarine, intense blue\n2 greens: viridian hue, sap green,\nalso yellow ochre, burnt sienna, burnt umber, and chinese white\n\nI know a lot of artists balk at hues... so far I like these and enjoy using them in my art journals. These are high quality student paints with good lightfastness ratings and nice saturation of color. If you can find this for under fifteen and are looking for paints to try, I suggest these as a great beginner or travel set.

So if you like it, it won't cost you much to add more to your collection, I own from sizes 0 - 8 in the round tip model and the designers tip model and spent a little over $100 for them. Then you have the replaceable pans which makes it so much easier and cheaper to replace colors that you love and use more than others. There is also room to add 8 additional colors of your choice to this tray. There are many colors in this series for you to customize your tray with, leaving you with your perfect color palette.

I recently bought this other set https://www.amazon.com/Winsor-Newton-Cotman-Colour-Compact/dp/B00004THXH/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472576228&sr=8-1&keywords=cotman+compact+watercolor+set to try out watercolor painting and I really like it but it was still a little larger than I wanted for taking with me.

Nothing but detail work is possible.  The best thing about these sets is that the pans are all removable so I can swap around what I want in each set.  The basics are repeated but after buying the compact set I felt I wanted a few other colors, even though I can mix.  Mostly I wanted the black, violet and gray.  I think these are great paints for someone just starting out who wants something better quality but still affordable. They mix nicely and a little goes a LONG way.\n\nBut I mostly love this set because of the water brush! I wasn't sure about it at first, considering how simple it looks, but it goes together easily AND securely, the pieces are tight enough when fitted together that it doesn't leak around the join, even with pressure.  Now the tip stays nice and pointy and seems to be continuously wet, but does not leak a bunch of water out.  That is until you squeeze it, then it does let out large beads above the tip if you push too hard.  I found that very gentle pressure wets the brush without the big drop of water coming out and possibly ruining your work.  This is my first water brush and I REALLY like it.  The tip on this is still fairly small, but I mostly like working on smaller pieces anyway.  You can also fit the brush in the pan when it's filled with water, and the area holding the brush is smartly thought out.  It has inserts that keep the brush from sliding around, so the brush won't slide left or right, risking the tip being smushed against the side.  I discovered also that the tip comes apart into two pieces as well, which means you could easily rinse the brush out for cleaning when you get home, etc.\n\nIf I had found this set first I would have bought it instead of the compact set probably but I like having both.  The compact set has more areas for mixing, and has a nice thumb hole for holding on to it which is convenient if you don't have a flat surface to set your paint on, and even a little side pan for water (I use it for another mixing spot). The water brush also fits into the compact set if you wanted to take it along in that.  The thing that I prefer about this set though is that the pans are more separated, AND they fit down into the openings for them. On the compact set there are these little bits that stick out which seem to be meant to hold the pans in if you push them down, but instead I found that they either don't do that at all, OR the pans pop back up flying out of the compact completely. So I've just let them be but then they stick up and jiggle around.", "summary": "In love with this set!", "unixReviewTime": 1472515200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2016", "reviewerID": "A1N4JNAANSVZCC", "asin": "B00004THXH", "style": {"Style Name:": " Sketchers Pocket Box"}, "reviewerName": "Vivian Rovsek", "reviewText": "Perfect little set!

The set comes with two cadmium yellows one in a pale hue, two reds on cadmium pale hue one alizarin, two blues one ultramarine one cobalt, two greens one viridian one sap, three earth tones in yellow ochre, burnt sienna and burnt umber, and lastly a chinese white. There isn't a really true red in this set (wouldve preferred a cadmium red over the pale hue), but if you mix the red pale hue with the alizarin you get a nice red. It also comes with a small watercolor brush for sketching and painting. It isn't something I would only use, I tend to bring a few of my favorite brushes, with sponges and small water-containers in their own little bag, but if need be i can just carry this around and be set. The pans are four per little case and there are three cases in the set. They can be pulled out easily and rearranged if needed.\n\nWhile doing some color swatches of the 12 half pans, this quality is about equal to my Sakura Koi Field Sketch Set with 24 wells. I am satisfied with the pigmentation, the colors come out bright, and have a smooth gradient with no chalky finish, as to be expected with these types of paints. I opted for this set for its portability and compact size, half the size of my Sakura Koi Set (half the colors but they have the 12 main ones that cover spectrum quite well).  I've included a photo of the swatches as well as some smaller swatches of mixing the complementary colors. As well as a size comparison between the two sets.\n\nThe set comes with two palettes that can be taken out, the first one can connect to the bottom, the other can remain in the lid, but if you requite more mixing room it is removable, the only issue is it is a little difficult to take out at first, but I am sure with some love over time it will be easier. This brings me to one of the few issues I have with this palette, it does not lay flat as depicted on the box, it tends to stay up which makes the palette fall over if left alone, This is not a big issue for me, seeing with time Im sure the plastic will wear down or if i take a blade to it and create a grove for it to lay flat.\n\nOver all this set is exactly what I was looking for, compact size, good amount of mixing wells/space and pigmentation.\n\nThe only con I have about this set is that the pans although will not fall out, do slide and tip slightly do to the space between each. I am sure sticking a tiny bit of sponge between them or a dot of hot glue under the pans would be a simple fix.\n\n**Note** The Ruler depicted is in CM **", "summary": "Big Things come in Small Packages!!

The mixing lid does not lay flat, so the paint drips down as you are mixing it, or even after.\n4.

Reed", "reviewText": "I bought these as an upgrade to my student grade reeves brand watercolors. I haven't done much with them yet, but I am excited to start playing with them. One of the pictures are all of the colors swatched out, which I plan to laminate and keep in my box. Another picture is The box compared to a standard gift card. As you can see the box is just a tad bigger than the gift card - it truly is pocket sized!\n\nThe brush is nothing to get excited over. It is just a small round or liner-type brush. I probably won't use it, as it gives me hand cramps since the handle is so tiny.\n\nI would like to address several complaints I have seen.\n\nFirst, with the watercolor cakes coming out of the pans. I simply took the cake out of the pan, put a big drop of water underneath, and stuck the paint cake back in. After a bit the water makes the paint a bit gummy, so I simply gave it a firm press, and I haven't had a problem since.\n\nAnother complaint is that the paint pans don't stay in the case. Well, that is true, but again I have a simple fix. I took the plastic pans of paint out of the box, and added just a dab of hot glue, then gave them a firm press back into the palette. This worked well. I tried prying them out, and they stick. When they are gone, you can simply take a pair of pliers and pull out the empty pan and replace. On my other set I used a piece of double sided tape that I cut in half length wise, then stuck the pans back in. I think I like it better then the hot glue. The tape holds well, but the pans can be pulled out just simply using the end of a brush to pry it out. Sticky tack/blue tack/museum putty works well too.\n\nBecause these pans are sold as open stock, meaning you can replace one color at a time, I would not suggest getting too carried away with super glueing the pans into the palette.", "summary": "Great for a step up from cheap student grade watercolors", "unixReviewTime": 1428624000}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "2", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2015", "reviewerID": "A1WRJWI8GXP1TU", "asin": "B00004THXH", "style": {"Style Name:": " 12 Tube Set"}, "reviewerName": "dani dee", "reviewText": "i got these as a gift and i absolutely love them!", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1427932800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2015", "reviewerID": "AKHRQ7LHUQWNH", "asin": "B00004THXH", "style": {"Style:": " Compact Set"}, "reviewerName": "msartiste4", "reviewText": "Windsor Newton Cotman is my go-to watercolor set.", "summary": "Windsor Newton Cotman is my go-to watercolor set.", "unixReviewTime": 1427328000}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2015", "reviewerID": "A23BSUY68GPW2L", "asin": "B00004THXH", "style": {"Style Name:": " Sketchers Pocket Box"}, "reviewerName": "Meg", "reviewText": "Wanted to try out Winsor's pan colors before I invested further and the price and palette caught my eye.\n\nDid a simple landscape last night and was definitely very pleased with the pigments and color selection.

I just bought this product and Amazon poises it as I've already reviewed it and can only edit it? Do I have a doppelgaenger out there, posing as me? I have bought this product, but years ago when W&N still offered whole pans in North America. So there's a lot messed up here.\nThis is the second time I've purchased nominally, in name only, the same product. Liked it the first time around. Noticeably different then, the product then was made in England and many of the albeit Cotman whole pans included were indeed real cadmiums and cobalts. On the description here, erroneously they are said cadmiums and cobalts, but they are not, they are merely hues of cadmium or cobalt. Of course, elsewhere there's the salesman's caveat, \"contents may vary\", but this is not the kind of straight-forward one expects from Amazon. Also, the actual pans are in a different wrapping, each explicitly saying, \"made in China\". Seems W&N has come to this.  :(\n(I have another  new W&N whole pan box, but delivered from Japan and in a nice metal box, 12-pan  format. Here the kicker is, \"made in France\"! I have not used it so don't know yet if the colors are good. I like my Senneliers, so this may be okay. But the heck is going on with W&N and / or Amazon?!)\nBut now back to this Cotman box, or should I call it \"alleged Cotman\" box. With the 24 Chinese hues, not genuine British pans with cadmiums and colbalts like my older, earlier purchase. Although much is different, I still very much like the plastic box the colors came in. Just like the older one. Very good, serviceable. I've had a lot of good use with it. No problem at all. Don't understand the complaints in that area at all.\nOh, the price went up about half again, since my last purchase.\nI'll give it 3 stars until I can test the pans in use and see if they're good, up to W&N (previous?) standards.\nAnd still, what is with Amazon claiming I'd reviewed this before!!!!!", "summary": "Many mistakes by Amazon review / product management.

The pack contains the same colors you remember as a kid along with new favorites like inchworm, laser lemon and macaroni and cheese. There were some specialty metallic crayons in mine along with some Gel FX crayons that I really liked and wish I could find more of. This is the same exact crayon you knew and loved as a kid and it still smells the same and as good as ever. It comes with the sharpener on the back too.

I has a pouch or \"net\" that holds refills which also is handy. Overall, I am very happy with this set. I allows you options for whatever detail work you are doing. For me personally the #2 is a God send because it is strong enough to handle leather work or rather the leather work I do. I create jewelry with leather and the #2 knives cuts it like butter.

Also, the back of the package (not the box, but the package the whole thing comes in) is just a tiny bit misleading.\n\nLet me see if I can explain this. On the back, there is an illustration explaining what each blade and handle does. As you can see in the product photo, there is a blade attached to each handle. On the back, it tells you what blades those are on each handle (which are #1, #2 and #5 blades). To the right of that, there is a list of the additional blades in the top portion of the product photo. There it lists the #2 blade again, but not #1 nor #5. At first glance, this makes you think that there are two #2 blades to be found, but instead there are two #11 blades, which it doesn't mention at all. That's a minor thing, but for newbs may be slightly confusing.\n\nOne thing I wish it had, was a \"map\" insert of what each blade is. You know, kind of like what a box of Valentine's Day chocolates has, that describes what each chocolate is. If the blade and knife holders had been white, it would have been easy to simply write it somewhere, but it's black. Only paint can be used on black.\n\nI ended up writing the blade number on the wood on the inside of the box, along the edge, just below each blade and to the left of the knives. I used a fine point Sharpie.\n\nThe box is fantastic! It's wood and quite durable looking. It has a closure that is way tight. It took me a few tries to get it to close fully.

I also use a trick I found on YouTube to tie the new thread to the old thread and slowly run the machine to pull the the new threads through.  You can search for it on youtube.  I only use the technique on the loopers, as the needles are easy to thread since you can flip the upper blade up out of the way.\n\nI don't understand why anyone is complaining about this model.

I found wetting the paper a little helps rub down to where the backing can eventually be pulled off but that process is very messy, time consuming and still may not work. Third is the background of these papers are white. If you plan on transferring letters to a colored piece of fabric the white background will be behind them unless you cut each letter out separately.\n\nI've noticed that Cricut and silhouette sell printable iron-on transfer papers. I'm going to try them next time. If you find something that works well stick with it and avoid these. These are a hassle and give mixed results at best.

I bought this transfer paper to make customized tank tops for my friend's bachelorette party. I used 95% cotton 5% spandex plain white cami tanks from F21  (make sure not to get any ribbed fabric, not sure how those would turn out but I wasn't gonna risk it). I used an HP C3100 series inkjet printer on the highest quality print setting and used the photo paper setting (in my experience this prints more cleanly). I made a logo with text in Word and then, to get a mirror image (so that the iron-on was flipped correctly) I  checked the \"flip horizantally\" box from the print menu--no other software required! The transfer paper instructions say to place a pillowcase between the iron and the fabric, but I didn't have a spare so I just used a different tank as my protective layer. I used the cotton setting on my iron and it took probably 2 minutes to transfer a 1/4 sized page, because initially I wasn't applying enough pressure and the corner had not transferred (I actually ripped it a little trying to peel it off)--so I just pressed it down again and kept ironing. I was amazed at how well I was able to recover from my mistake. You couldn't see a tear anywhere. The results honestly looked professionally done. The image transfers a little bit lighter than it looks on your screen, but not drastically enough to make me want to go back and change anything. I was also very impressed with how legible my text was. My logo had white block lettering text with a light blue outline in size 18 font and it was crisp and legible.\n\nOne thing I would recommend is to trim as close to your image as possible. I was transferring a circular logo but just cut out a square, thinking the blank parts would not show up. However, blank parts of paper will still transfer onto your fabric as a kind of \"clear\" paint--the change in texture is subtle but noticible. So anything that you did not intend to be part of your image, trim with scissors! Also, I wish it came with more than 6 sheets. I think I would buy these again though.

For other crafty types, these would also be perfect for ironing onto sew-in labels (my next project).  I can't speak to how they stand up in the wash yet, but I also read that if, after they've cooled, you iron again with just a piece of parchment paper on top, you'll remove a little of the excess \"plastic-ey\" coating and also set the design/colors a bit more too, but I haven't done that yet....\n\nEither way, I love my new labels made with this transfer paper.

Our only difficulty came when we realized we'd have to reverse the image, since it had writing. The directions said we'd be able to find a computer command that would let us do that -- either \"flip image\" or \"mirror image.\" We couldn't find that capability anywhere, even though we have an HP printer and the transfer is HP. We ended up importing the image to a photoshopping program and flipping it and printing it out from there.\n\nThe ironing directions call for the hottest cotton setting without steam. We notched it down a little, as our steam setting started sooner than the highest cotton setting. It all worked just fine. Bonus: Each pack has a BoxTops label for your school.

They are AP certified non-toxic and not recommended for children under 36 months (as printed on the box, see photo).\nA nice offering of colors and shades in a small set. Oil crayons are hexagonal and will not roll off the working table. These feel solid to handle and are of a generous size compared to most child-audience art brands.\n\nI have included a color chart and some color tests with this review.\nAmong the colors, a metallic silver and metallic gold are included. While the silver looks more like aluminum, the gold looks brassy and on the green side.\n\nAt the top of the color chart I used the teal color as a base, then used the white on the left side and the black on the right side. The white was pretty decent and I was able to blend out the color of the teal further to the left as I went along.\n\nThe black is really opaque and virtually blotted out most of the teal color so I put down a light layer of the teal to illustrate a very dark shade.\n\nI laid purple down first and then yellow to meet in the middle for a 'neutral' color. Having put the yellow down second dragged bits of the purple across into the yellow area. There is also 'crumbs'.\n(Thankfully these crumbs are not easily airborne nor do not all easily fall off the working surface even when blown onto. I also have trouble imagining the bits getting easily inhaled.)\n\nI then applied yellow first, and the purple last. That was better and any yellow dragged over to the purple side wasn't too obvious unless there was a close-up inspection.\n\nI put down a long swatch of what I would consider the navy blue in the set, then sampled it with Sakura brand colorless extenders and two different white pastels--the set's own white, and Junior Artist white. The set's own white was pretty good with coverage and blending.\n\nThese were really quite easy to use and needed very little pressure to put color down. Layering over the same color did not pose too many problems but putting down thicker layers with heavier pressure did. Colors can be pushed out from under the pastel when heavy pressure and/or too much color is laid down or become muddied and uneven. Layering different colors atop one another might need pre-thought out strategy to prevent color drag.\nBlending color can be easily obtained with a variety of techniques/items.\n\nUsage of these colors did not bleed any oily remnants through the sketchbook page, nor out around the swatches.\nI would not use them for adult coloring books as colors easily rub onto the page above.\n\nI would buy these with confidence for a child.", "summary": "Great for absolute beginners and children.

So I branched out and got these double-ended ones. I did NOT like them at all.\n\nFor clarification, I am NOT an artist - this review is solely based on my use of them for Adult Coloring Books. Specifically, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Secret-Garden-An-Inky-Treasure-Hunt-and-Coloring-Book/dp/1780671067/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Coloring Book</a>.\n\nBUT, I do NOT like the Double Tipped Markers. I DID like that these markers come in TONS of colors. I even went and bought some that were the single markers just to get some extra colors - like the light blue in the photo. Unfortunately, they don't write/draw/color at all like the 'brush tips;' which are awesome. These are firm and clumsy for fine detail coloring. Additionally, I didn't like the thickness of these in my hand - they're really wide.\n\nMost importantly, I was SO DISAPPOINTED to realize these big fat markers by Prismacolor BLEED. On one page, I used all brush tip markers EXCEPT for some spots of light blue. It was a lighter color than all the others, and made by the same company, so surely (I thought) it wouldn't bleed. It did - see photos. The first photos are a page colored with the standard brush tips by Prismacolor. They didn't bleed. I used ONE of the Double-Ended Brush Tips (THIS type of marker), the light blue, and it DID bleed. The owl image is the backside of that same page. So sad.

They were going to have to do homework \"on the go\" and I wanted them to be fully stocked so there couldn't be any excuses as to why there was still homework at bedtime.  One of the essential items was Pink Pearl erasers because they use them in school.\n\nWe had great success with these erasers until the kids misplaced them, borrowed them from a siblings pencil box, wouldn't give them back...soon there weren't enough erasers to go around.  Names were written on them so they wouldn't get stolen again.\n\nWhen I was a kid, back in the stone ages, I had to wear the erasers off of my pencils before my mother would even consider buying me a special eraser.  And even then we had those terrible tiny erasers that slipped on the top of your pencil and never really worked that well.\n\nBut pencils these days seem to have really crummy erasers.  Either they smudge the pencil all over the paper, tear a hole in the homework, or just plain don't work.  A spare eraser is essential.\n\nPink Pearl erasers do a good job of getting the pencil of the paper without ripping (unless there is a lot of erasing happening).\n\nI now have a drawer full of Pink Pear erasers at the ready.

I'm a sewing teacher and doll pattern-maker, which means I cut a lot of fabric! These shears are excellent for sewing, especially if you have arthritis in your hands, or are worried about repetitive strain injury. They're spring-loaded, which means they pop open on their own when you unlock them. All you have to do is close them to cut your fabric, and with every stroke, they'll re-open automatically. Easy peasy! (Just remember to lock them when you're done cutting, to avoid injury.)\n\nJust to be clear, these are fabric shears, not regular, everyday scissors. They're specially shaped for cutting fabric without lifting it off the table. The handles are slightly padded, so they're comfortable to hold, and the grip is wide enough that it doesn't pinch your fingers, the way some scissors do. I always recommend these shears to my students, and it's one way that I can judge how serious a student is about taking classes. If they're willing to pay a little extra for the \"good\" shears, I know they're dedicated. If not, they'll buy a cheap pair of shears, which are difficult to cut with.\n\nLast week, I borrowed one of my students' brand-new pair of shears to demonstrate proper cutting technique and was startled by how much easier they were to cut with than mine! Apparently, mine had grown dull and it happened so slowly, I didn't even notice. It would have been difficult to get to the shop to get them sharpened, so I simply ordered a new pair. It was the exact same Amazon listing as the first pair I bought several years ago, but the shears I received were different. Instead of being gray and black, with a small orange lock, they're bright orange and white, which is rather hideous. Even my students have commented on how ugly the new shears are! That's disappointing, especially since the photo in the description still shows the old gray and black version. (Or it did at the time of my purchase.)\n\nEven so, I cannot complain. These are excellent shears for cutting fabrics of all types, from heavy denim to fragile chiffon, and everything in between. I use them daily, and I will keep returning to buy them every time I need a new pair. I won't even consider other shears! I might even buy an extra pair to keep on hand in case anything happens to mine. They last a long time, too! I had my first pair of shears for at least seven years, without any problems. The only reason I replaced them is because they were growing dull. But if you have a sewing shop nearby, you can simply get yours sharpened once a year, and they'll last a lifetime!\n\nI was going to deduct a star for the awful color of my new pair, but that's superficial and I really shouldn't allow the color to bother me. All things considered, these are a GREAT pair of sewing shears! Spring-loaded, comfort grip, super sharp---all you could ask for in a pair of sewing shears. Five stars and highly recommended to anyone who sews, quilts, or needs to cut fabric for any reason. (Note: They aren't suitable for clipping, notching, or trimming seam allowances, or for clipping threads. They're just too large---you run the risk of accidentally cutting your main fabric. For jobs like that, I recommend a pair of 4-inch scissors, like the \"lightweight embroidery scissors\" made by Gingher.)", "summary": "Best Sewing Shears Ever!", "unixReviewTime": 1435017600}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2015", "reviewerID": "A3FNDA82GV5TIJ", "asin": "B00006IFNC", "style": {"Size:": " 10-Inches"}, "reviewerName": "SewCakeNPretty", "reviewText": "Similar to Fiskars 8 Inch Softouch Spring Action Titanium Nitride, except for the coating.

I found them to easy to use with very little fatigue afterwards.  However, when cutting a heavy twill (about the same weight as an average pair of jeans) the fabric frequently jammed up in the scissors, wedging between the blades instead of cutting.  This is highly disappointing, as I was growing to love these scissors.  Instead, I had to drag out the trusty old fashioned ones to do the job.  That has cost these scissors a full star--they should be able to cut this type of fabric dependably as well.\n\nThe grips are comfortable, and fit my hand well.  The motions required to operate the scissors are easy for the hand to repeat without fatigue, and the scissors are easy to control accurately while cutting.  These are all great features while using these scissors.  The sole negative that has nearly cost these scissors a full star is the locking mechanism.  It does not operate easily and I cannot operate it with one hand.  That means if I want to lock OR unlock the scissors, I have to change my grip and use the other hand to operate the lock.

And you CAN overdue it.  We use a scratch piece of paper and just move it while adding slight pressure back and forth and this will get it flowing.\n2)  Once in a while ~ Paint will just flow, for no real reason.

Over the years I've bought (and sometimes given away) nearly every brand of paint, marker, pen, pastel (oil and clay-based) on the market, sometimes paying a fairly high price. For years my favorite brand of oil pastel has been Sennelier (not cheap).\n\nI first heard of Portfolio after seeing them in artwork on someone's (don't remember who) blog. I enjoy media that doesn't require a lot of fuss and mess, so I'm a big fan of watercolor pencils and crayons, brush pens and markers, but sometimes I want something with more texture. After reading more about these, I decided to try them: they're by Crayola, after all--who doesn't like Crayola products? I've used them on different  weight and textured papers and on cardboard. They glide on smoothly, disperse easily with water and you can smudge them with your fingers before or after applying water. (I use a Niji waterbrush with them.)\n\nThey're very soft (which is why they glide so easily across your paper), so if you use too much pressure, they leave behind some crumbs. You can just brush these off with a paper towel or blend them into your artwork with a finger. Colors  (which are vibrant) blend well together, too--not as thoroughly as paint will, but that's to be expected. I like these better than my watercolor crayons because they don't dry as quickly, giving you more time to blend.\n\nAs for mixed media, you can use them (let the artwork dry first) with permanent markers, like Sharpie, but you will need to stop occasionally and \"clean\" the marker by scribbling with it on plain paper to remove any waxy/oily residue. (For that reason, I'd never use expensive markers like Copic with them.) They work well with acrylic paint and India ink. I haven't tried them with oil paint, but I'd expect them to work well together. You can layer them over watercolors, but not the other way around. (Well, you can, but the results may be disappointing, depending on the effect you're going for.)\n\nBottom line: l love them!

(Usually, in art supplies, you do get what you pay for... Though not aaalways!)\n\nI am an artist and much of my art is sold to high-end markets. I wanted to purchase some cheaper products to practice with and to use while playing with my nieces and nephews. So I purchased several different brands to try out. Many of the lower-priced products also have much more expensive versions, made from the same company. So if the lower-priced items end up performing really well, then you can bet that the higher-end products will likely knock your socks off.\n\nNow, I bought the following oil pastels to try out (I will list them from best performance to worst) below:\n\n*Portfolio\n*Pentel\n*Expressionist by Sakura\n*Neocolor 2 by Caran D'ache (These are pretty darn expensive, and they are nowhere near the quality of the Portfolio brand)\n*Faber Castel metallics (metallics are difficult to compare with the others, but these were pretty great for what they were)\n\nThis brand, Portfolio, far surpassed any and all other oil pastels that I have tried! Very buttery and so smooth, on their own and when blended. Great for mixed media too, over watercolor and acrylic paints. I was sincerely so so very shocked! They are very affordable (I want to buy these in bulk now, and stock up!!!) and they are so easy to clean up.

I buy them to use when I'm too lazy to clean a brush, or to apply stain to my smaller wood projects like bowls and small boxes or whatever.\n\nThe thing I like is that the foam stays adhered to the handle, even if I've used it so much the foam is starting to fall apart.  I've used them for some latex and oil-based paint and they're not too bad for that either.  No brush marks, no bristles left in the finish (which will happen, even with my expensive badger brushes). Also, they're good for laying down polyurethane with no brush lines.\n\nI am finishing (today) a wood serving table for my church and it's reclaimed pine with just a poly finish.  At 7' long by 30 inches wide, it's a lot of poly to apply and I decided against wiping varnish and am brushing it on. I used these for the first two coats and will use them for the final top coat also.\n\nA couple of suggestions:  don't try to squeeze the last bit of finish out of them or you'll end up with bits of foam in your work piece. That's not the brushes fault; it's the result of too much pressure.  Also, it's a good idea to treat it like a brush; put a little spirits or thinned finish in it before you dip for you first application.  Also, tip it off like you would a brush.  There's a temptation (don't ask me how I know) to use these as a sort of endless reservoir of finish so you never have to go back to the can but it ain't so.  Use these like a brush and they'll do a good job.\n\nAs for lacquer, I have no idea. I have used these with shellac with mixed results (the brushes will fall apart quickly) but not brushing lacquer.

Stand with the product on the floor in front of you, standing up on one of its long edges. You can lean it against your knees.\n2. Step with one foot on the outer loop that's resting on the floor.\n3. With palms facing out, elbows near your sides and one hand on each corner, grasp the outer, upper edges. Grab the stiff part of the edges where it begins to curve downward toward the floor, and make sure to grab both the outer and inner wire loops at the same time.\n4. Now, with the courage of your convictions, do the next maneuver: holding on tightly, rotate your arms in one smooth, sweeping motion so your palms end up facing in and your elbows point out. About halfway through this motion the product should look like a Pringle. Lower your hands to the floor and the oval shape should turn into a neatly stacked coil.\n\nHere's a handy video of this method:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHSNcZJHdRI\n\nThere are other methods for coiling a band saw blade-- just search for videos and those methods will work too.\n\nHope that helps someone.", "summary": "How to coil it up.

Olsen", "reviewText": "I had tried the little rubber adhesive backed feet and the sandpaper dots, but I was still searching for the perfect solution to the slippery backs of the quilting rulers. For me, this doesn't seem to be it. In a class I took 2 or 3 years ago our instructor told us about this product and how wonderful it is. I bought two packages to make sure I had enough to cover the backs of all my rulers--I have more rulers than I really need. The application didn't go quite as smoothly as the instructions indicated. It just didn't want to stick to some of the rulers (all of which were the same Omnigrid brand). It is supposed to work on the principle of static cling, I guess, but I ended up having to dampen some of the rulers to make this product stick. There is no adhesive involved. This is a plus when it comes to removal if you decide not to keep it on your rulers--no sticky backs--but then, maybe that would be the solution I am looking for.\n\nI found that when the product was new it did seem to lessen slightly the tendency of the ruler to slide across the fabric as you apply pressure and cut. However, it didn't seem to last very long. The more I used the rulers the more it appeared that the film had less and less of its nominal at best gripping power. I haven't taken the time to tear it off of all of my rulers--it isn't hurting anything where it is, even if it isn't greatly helping. But as edges start to curl up I peel it off and I have about half of my rulers with it and half without. I admit that as I work with them I have a hard time telling which have it and  which don't.\n\nIf anyone has a recommendation about something that has really worked for them I would be interested. My complaint about the little rubber feet is the fact that the ruler doesn't sit flat on the fabric and the fabric can shift a little as you cut--especially at the edges or folds. The sandpaper dots grabbed the fabric too well at times, making repositioning of the rulers difficult, and they are not transparent, so wherever you apply them they obscure the lines on the rulers. This is especially bothersome on the smallest rulers.

Though, after a couple months of using this product on my rulers, I haven't had to replace any squares and they still grip quite well.\n\nWord to the wise: the instructions tell you to use your ruler and rotary cutter to cut the Invisible Grip to the desired size. I did this and found that it dulled my nearly-new 60mm blade sooooooo badly that I had to replace it. So, use household scissors (NOT your fabric/crafting scissors), cut squares or strips and apply them to the backs of your rulers along the edges.

This just makes it less likely to move when I don't want it to. It still can. If you're looking for something that will glue your ruler to your fabric, this isn't it. If all you want is a ruler that doesn't slide so easily, this will provide it.\n\nBe sure your hands and the ruler are clean before starting. Be sure to put the same side against the ruler as was against the paper. Don't stretch it, don't mess with it, don't fuss: it doesn't have to be perfect. It should be at least a quarter inch smaller than the ruler on every side, but can be even smaller than that. Doesn't even have to be the exact shape of the ruler, though you'll have better luck if it does cover most of it.
