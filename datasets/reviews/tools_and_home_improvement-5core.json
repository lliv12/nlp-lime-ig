But that isn't my complaint. Its their useless service that renders the most possible difficulty and monetary gain on the company that disturbs me. I actually dropped off my heater to get fixed when this company was named SuperGreen, seems they changed names. Their supposed heating element that lasts 20 years was broken in 10 months. When I tried to pick it up, they made it as difficult for me to pick up as possible after 5pm at the worst traffic. They are never in the office, but if you show up they will try to make a show that they are working hard. If you call them its some VOIP callback system with really bad sound quality, the baby crying in the background gives it away pretty quickly. This product seems like some kind of repackaged Alibaba heater, as the Celsius reading is obviously not made for the USA market.\n\nRather than jump through their hoops to pick up my repaired heater, I just left it there because I figured it will save me more problems down the road and I really don't want to deal with their bad service anymore. I bought another company's water heater, installed it myself. Didn't require any contractor to install it and the warranty is good. The new water heater readings are in F, not C.  The Supergreen/SioGreen dial adjusting inlet where you have to manually turn wasn't required, my new water heater just worked. Less headache, more hot water.

(This is already pretty small though!)\n\nCaveat: I can't say yet how it is on battery-life... Haven't used it enough yet. But of course I only use rechargeable batteries with things like this so it shouldn't matter *too* much, since I don't intend to use it frequently. I also can't say how long the bulb will last, which is probably the more important thing.

Still, it is certainly nice that when I am through reading for the night I can just turn off the book-light rather than having to get off my bed, walk around to where the wall switch is to turn off the room light, and then return to my bed. The light comes with the option to use two lights, or just one, and so far I have used both lights so I have to push the button twice to turn it off, but that is no problem. I also have a good supply of AAA's already so when I need to replace the batteries I can do so right away.

The plastic clip seems likely to hold up nicely and stand up to the load of being clipped and un-clipped a LOT.  The neck is finely jointed black metal, and it bends easily, but the weight of the light head can't bend it.  The neck feels like it will stand up just fine to lots of bending.  The light is fairly white to my eye.  If there is a bluish tinge, it is very slight.  And it's plenty bright enough for reading a book it is clipped to.\n\nSwitch seems sturdy, clicks easily but distinctly, and is easy to find right on the top side of the light head.  Hit the switch once to turn both lights on; hit it again and the 'inner' light turns off and outer light stays on; hit it a third time and all lights are off.\n\nBattery cover slides on and off just like pretty much any TV remote or cell phone: just apply a little downward pressure with with your finger on the little 'arrow' molded into the battery cover and push.  Cover slides off revealing the battery compartment.  No screwdriver or any other tool needed.\n\nIt has a rubber pad on the end of the clip, which matches up with a rubber pad on the base, helping it to stay in place on hard surfaces.  Some reviews have noted that it slides around a bit on thin book covers, and I saw that too *IF* I didn't push the clip as far down as it would go on the cover.  When I clipped it as far onto the hardcover as it would go, it didn't move at all when I waved the book around.\n\nThe max thickness that the clip will go on is 1 1/8\" fully (basically 'hyper') extended.\nThe clip seems designed to work optimally when the item it is clipped on is 3/8\" to 3/4\" thick.\nBUT of course it still works OK on thinner and thicker stuff than that.\n\nBottom line: I can't think of anything I'd change.  Would be a tich nicer for clipping onto books if the battery box was lighter and thinner.  But you can't get AAAA batteries just everywhere, and they wouldn't last as long.  Also if the battery box was much lighter, you couldn't use it as a lamp base.\n\nDIMENSIONS:\nBase battery box: 3.1\"L x 1.6\"W x 0.65\"H.\nClip Triangle Height: 0.7\"\nOverall height from bottom of base to top of clip: 1.7\"\n\nFlexible Neck Length (not counting light head): 7.75\n  BUT the neck starts 0.6\" in from the end of the battery box.\n  Neck diameter: 5/32\"  (0.15\").\n\nLight Head: 2.18\"L  x 0.8\"W x 0.64\"H.", "summary": "Very nice.

It does have a very slight bluish/purpleish hue to it, but nowhere near the blueness of some of the cheap reading lights I've used in the past.\n\nIf you are considering clipping this on your headboard, make sure you measure the width of your headboard first. The clip on this light only opens about 1.5 inches wide, and my headboard is about 2 inches wide. To solve this, I simply screwed a small piece of 1/4 inch thick wood to the back side of the headboard so that it sticks up about 1 inch higher than the headboard on my side of the bed. I just clip the light to that. This doesn't damage the finished side of the headboard, so if I ever stop using this light, I can just remove the little piece of wood.\n\nI've used this light nightly for the last several months now and have not had to replace the batteries yet.

I'm often a passenger in several-hour-long car trips that go late into the night, and I love having this light to read by (I don't get carsick reading in a car like many people do).  I like the light so much that just a couple of weeks ago, I bought another one as a back-up.  And I'm glad I did.  The LED lights are so nice and bright that my husband and I used these booklights throughout Hurricane Sandy, after our power went out, not just to read by but to use as we moved throughout the house, and also when we took the dog outside after dark.  Both lights were on for hours and never seemed to lose their power.\n\nI also love that these Mighty-Bright 2-Lights run on AAA batteries, which are inexpensive, easy to replace, last a long time, and you can even get rechargeable AAA batteries these days.  This is in sharp contrast to booklights that run on button-shaped batteries which I've found to be unreliable, don't last very long, and that their power gradually fades so that most of the time the booklight doesn't produce a crisp (or even usable) amount of light. And those button-shaped batteries are expensive and not rechargeable.\n\nI gave the Mighty-Bright 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it's overpriced for a booklight, but it's durable and the LEDs are great.  Recommend.\n\nUPDATE:  I am now upgrading this book light to 5 stars because I feel it's worth it in spite of its high cost.  I just replaced one of the 2 lights I initially bought because my dog got hold of one of them and chewed it to pieces. I value book lights so much that I can't stand the thought of being without one on one of our long night-time drives, and these book lights have held up so well (except for the dog chewing up one of them).  Thus I decided to replace the one I lost with the exact same model.  The problem I have is because I married a New York driver, which could make anybody's nerves raw.

The kids really enjoyed reading their respective books, and never complained about needing more light.  We ordered another, so that they can each have one to themselves.

Like other reviewers, I've already ordered a second one and can see ordering more, in black or other colors, for other uses and especially, for holiday gifts.\n\nLATEST DISCOVERY: I didn't realize why the clip worked so very well. It's because it has small, soft rubber pads inside the mouth of the clip, which ensure even better grip without so much pressure. It clips onto various places on my laptop or sits with the tiniest footprint on its stable base (because of the battery weight), right up against the keyboard.\n\nThe three light settings are more than enough to light up my 17-inch keyboard without glare and with its tiny head and thin flex neck, it's easy to position the device so as not to block your field of vision to the screen.\n\nTo sum it up, this light gets top marks on the overall design, the clamp, the base, the neck, the soft and sure light switch, the lighting in either light mode and its general very low profile.\n\nI would pay $20 or $25 for a Mighty Bright without blinking an eye. I believe what Amazon buyers are all benefiting greatly from is very low prices based on mass sales generated by listing beneath the great Amazon name.\n\nAdditional info: This light replaces an excellent, but quite bulky light I've used on my laptop keyboard, SE FL89020L 20 LED Silver Lamp Light, for $9.17 on Prime. I'll find other uses for the FL89020L, including duty holding down a tent flap in a gale.\n\nI will also include my stock comment about batteries: All batteries, including button style, are so affordable now with Amazon as not to be a factor in the vast majority of battery powered gadgets. When you can get five Sony button batteries on Amazon prime for $3.18 total, cost is no longer an issue, IMHO.\n\n**May come back later and update.

After about 6 months I noticed that it has gotten very dim. It was getting dim gradually so I did not even notice until it felt like it was not helpful at all. After a quick battery change it is back to being nice and bright. The non-rechargeable batteries lasted 4 months of brief daily use (5-6 mins daily). Looking back I probably should have changed the batteries a month ago. I switched to rechargeable batteries, so I expect I would need to change them every few months.\n\nI have to admit that I use this Book Light in some unconventional places: my two main uses of the light are in the bathroom.\n\nI am attaching a collage of three photos that demonstrates my two uses, along with the photo of the light next to the ruler. The very flexible 10\" neck of the light provides the key to its many uses. And the two LED light is mighty bright. Given that I always place it several feet away from the book I always use it on full 2 LED power. The light switch is located on top of the light unit, it fits into the design so well that you may not even notice it right away.\n\nThe clip opens wide and hold strong. I can open the clip 1 1/8 inches wide. Inside the clip there is soft spongy material which provides good grip and protection to the thing you are clipping the light to. The clip loaded with 3 (AAA sized) batteries is much heavier than the ultra light neck + light itself, so the unit can be used as a free standing light by using the clip as a stand.\n\nThe only difficulty I had with the light was closing the battery compartment after inserting the batteries. It was a bit of a tight squeeze and required a bit of wiggling of the batteries to get them out of the way.\nThe light can run on AC adapter but it is not included.\n\nMy two main uses:\n\n1) I like reading while on the toilet, but don't like the overhead light to be on because it has a built-in fan and I prefer quiet time. To solve this problem Xtraflex light mounts perfectly on the shelve near the toilet. It provides good light from a distance of 2.5 feet.\n\n2) Sometimes I like to take a soak in a tub and read a book or magazine in a bubble bath. It is such a treat! But the lighting is poor as the overhead light is in center of the bathroom, not behind me. However I now mount Mighty Bright Xraflex Book Light on the shower caddy which is behind my head in the tub and this gives me good lighting from a distance of 3 feet.\n\nI am impressed with the versatility of Might Bright Xtraflex Book Light. This light lets me pamper myself in the bathroom by reading in the tub or on the toilet, I am really enjoying it.\n\nAli Julia review", "summary": "Good amount of light, excellent clip", "unixReviewTime": 1334016000}, {"overall": 3.0, "vote": "3", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2012", "reviewerID": "A1WK1MF2WOTSTM", "asin": "193362275X", "style": {"Format:": " Kitchen"}, "reviewerName": "LifeIsShort", "reviewText": "Nice light overall.

All the e-reader book lights are way overpriced or had horrible reviews, so I decided to try to find one that would work for my Kindle. Luckily a few other reviews on here said that it worked well for their Kindle, so I felt pretty safe buying this one. So, my review mostly focuses on its functionality with a Kindle.\n\nI have a cover on my Kindle, but this still fits over it even with the front cover flipped to the back with the clamp stretched out almost to the max. But it still fits, so no complaints there. The clamp can't be pushed all the way down or else it impedes on my reading space, but even with it having a slight gap at the top it's still secured well. It doesn't move around or anything. The clamp spring is very tight and sturdy. The clamp itself is a little bulky and heavy, but it's because it takes AAA batteries. I compared this to others that were lighter, but took specialty batteries and decided that I'd rather have a little bigger of a light than have to go find a weird battery.  The adjustable arm on the light is longer than what is necessary for my Kindle, but it's nice to have a lot of space for adjusting, it's easy to get it in just the right pace to get a good amount of light without a glare. The light itself is bright! You push the button once and 2 lights come on, push again and 1 turns off and push again and they all turn off. I have only ever needed one light on, even when it's pitch black.\n\nOverall the design is sturdy, the light is bright, and the price is right. I have recommended this to other Kindle users who have bought it and love it a lot also. I think it would also work great with paperback and hardback books!\n\nUpdate: If you're wondering how long the batteries last, started using this light at the end of March and just changed the batteries for the first time today, June 22.

It has 2 bulbs and you can turn on one or both, which is like adjusting the brightness to your liking. I normally need just one bulb lit, even in a completely dark room, but when the batteries grow weak, turning on both bulbs gives me more hours of readable light before the batteries go dead. The LED lights allegedly will last a lifetime. I also use this as a mini-flashlight sometimes.\n\nCon: Batteries must be replaced. I tried the Mighty Bright light that comes with an AC Adapter, which didn't work quite right and I returned it, but I also realized that being plugged into a wall isn't always practical when you're reading in bed, or anywhere else for that matter.

I also use an Oberon cover for my Kindle and have a hard time getting the light to stay in place...\n\n3) Field of light seems pretty wide to me.  Of course, this depends on how high you have that neck.  For my use so far, the light placement gives me a range of light that looks more suited to landscape vs. portrait.\n\nI personally like the long neck, though I've seen a couple of complaints here about it.  For me, that long neck makes it relatively easy to shift the light to minimize glare while keeping the head out of my way.  I usually shift it to the left or right of my Kindle and take advantage of that wide field of light.\n\nOn-off switch is easy to locate in the dark.

Too many reviews and it seems like most people want a really bright light, which I don't - I want a dimmer one so I can see my Kindle and my husband can still sleep. So I had to go to a store to try some out; Barnes and Noble brick and mortar store has a few in its booklight selection. This one is really light and small (it uses those annoying flat batteries rather than AAAs, but I am making that sacrifice for size and weight). It has one LED v. 2 or more for the other ones. It is still too bright in the dead of night. I \"solved\" this by cutting two pieces of white electrical tape to size and putting them over the entire lighted part, so that the light is quite well dimmed. There is still a little glare, and it is annoying. But the lights all cause glare -- it is definitly possible to angle them up to reduce glare, but then the size of the cone of light they cast gets bigger, and that defeats the purpose of trying to light up only the Kindle screen itself and not my husband's side of the bed. You can clip this on the side of the Kindle instead of the front, and choose the side that points the light away from your partner. That also helps. The light also \"leaks\" a little out of the back of the light switch area (mine is a dark blue color light, so it looks like there is a blue light on the back of the light's head). I covered that up with black electrical tape.\n\nI have pretty light-sensitive eyes myself, so I just needed a little light to allow nighttime reading. This light, modified, is a decent solution.

I haven't found a need in my particular situation to have a reading light for the Kindle, so I haven't bought one. What I have found is as I am in my 60's, my close focus of my eyeballs isn't what it used to be. When I get debris, eyelash or a cat hair in my eye, it is tough to see it to remove it. So, I bought a 10x magnifying mirror. It magnifies sufficiently for me to focus close enough to see debris in my eye. But, there isn't enough light. (Growing old is not perfect, but it is wonderful!) Anyway, I bought this light to put on my magnifying mirror so I can see to get things out of my eyes, or trim nose hair, or other such entertaining activities. Works perfectly for this purpose.\n\nBut, I put it on my Kindle to see how it would work in its designed mission. Here's what I find based on both applications: Base clip holds tightly and doesn't slide off. AAA batteries are cheap and common. The light has two super bright LEDs. The switch is a push button, it will turn both on, the turn one off, then turn the other off. It is very bright and projects a beam a little wider than the kindle itself (6-inch, keyboard Kindle model). More than enough light to see the screen and the keyboard. There are no dark spots, bright from the middle to the edge. One light is plenty for my Kindle. Two provides an amazing amount of light and does not glare. The goose neck has ample length to position where you want it. It will hold in any position its put in. The batteries account for most of its weight. It's well made, should last a long while. And one function - the clip serves as a base and will sit upright on a flat surface to serve as a small desk light. That has been a useful function.\n\nI wish I had gotten this long ago.

Designed for children, it can just as easily be used by adults because the monkey is removable. It comes with a detachable clip, making it useful not just for books, but laptop users as well. MacBooks come with their own backlit keyboards, but most PCs do not and I often have a hard time identifying keys on my HP laptop when I'm surfing at night. The flexible gooseneck makes it very versatile as a mini-flashlight as well. It's bright and competes with some LED flashlights I own. If you have a wall plug, you can also use it as a portable nightlight for home or on trips. Just point the neck towards a wall or floor to mitigate the brightness to your needs. The clip also makes it useful for clipping onto hat brims or shirt pockets for various non-reading situations.\n\nAs good as this light is, I do have only 2 minor complaints about the product's design: one is that the monkey figurine feels tacked on, quite literally. While it certainly is cute, the rigid mounting bracket isn't very good. It can fall off easily when handling the light, making it easy to lose. The other issue is that the USB connector feels loose because it lacks the metal sheathe other USB devices commonly have. This jacket allow them to sit snugly inside the port. Without it, depending on the angle of the gooseneck, the center of gravity may affect the connection with the contacts. The only other thing is that the manual could perhaps be more detailed on total charging time and battery life expectancy. Otherwise, a fine and useful light for home or travel. If taking on the road, the monkey should perhaps stay home to avoid loss.\n\nManufacturer provided test unit for evaluation.", "summary": "Versatile gooseneck reading light", "unixReviewTime": 1425772800}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "3", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2015", "reviewerID": "A3MHGA6BJJ7P27", "asin": "1940019605", "style": {"Color:": " Blue"}, "reviewerName": "W.T.Hoffman", "reviewText": "Its about time someone designed a book light that you can recharge.

However when I dim them to 50% they will randomly flash for a while, then they will be fine for a while then flash again. This is VERY irritating.

I'll comment on them as I get to them.  Our store will be selling all these 110v lights so I'll have rightful comments in due time.

Linn", "reviewText": "I've had undercabinet lighting in my kitchens for many years.  Earlier systems used small florescent bulbs that were bulky and somewhat expensive if you needed more than one.  Then, halogen lighting started to appear, but they were low-voltage systems and required an external transformer, an inconvenience and unreliable.  Then, a big-box home improvement store offered individual, small, round, lights with each operating independently, i.e., no transformer, running directly from 120 vac.  Each light has its own ac plug which is somewhat inconvenient when you have 6 or 8 or more to plug in.  What I do is to cut the plug off and connect them all together in one or more electrical boxes mounted under the cabinet.  This approach also allows you to install a single dimmer to adjust the brightnest of all. Very nice effect and reduces the heat coming off the lamps.  I once did this during a major kitchen upgrade which was pretty easy.  But, recently, I did this to an existing kitchen.  This required making holes in the backsplash and patching them later, or, in my case taking this opportunity to add a tile backspash which covered the patched holes. The only downside to using these halogen lamps is that replacements at the big-box store are quite expensive - $4 to $5.  I haven't had to replace too many but was pleased to find this much lower cost source of lamps at Amazon.

So I had a love-hate relationship with sanders. My first sander was actually a Bosch finishing sander. I used it to refinish a table once, and spent half four hours trying to get rid of swirl marks, then had a tingling sensation in my wrist for the next day. I eventually went with a nice 5\" Makita random orbit sander, but it wasn't any gentler on my wrists, and on top of that, with round pads, it was basically useless for corners or any even moderately complicated shapes.\n\nFinally, when I had a larger project that required more substantial sanding, I bought a 6 amp 6\" random orbit sander from Bosch. Sure, it worked faster - but was heavy, unwieldy, *extremely* noisy - and I still hated using it for more than 5 minutes or so.\n\nSo, I changed my ways. I bought this sander for finishing work, and let me tell you: it's awesome. It's ergonomic and almost completely vibration-free. It's pretty quiet... and it still packs quite a punch. It takes cheap sheet paper, too, so you're not bleeding money as quickly as you would with sanding discs. The only caveats to keep in mind is that it doesn't come with dust extraction; and in part because of no forced airflow, it gets warm after a while.\n\nAs for serious sanding - say, when stripping finishes or surfacing rough lumber - I just went with a handheld 3 x 21\" belt sander; it's a beast, but it's fast, quiet, and gentle on my joints. I suspect that a belt + sheet sander combo makes much more sense than trying to use a random orbit sander for everything - and getting RSI.", "summary": "Get this if you want to enjoy sanding", "unixReviewTime": 1469145600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2016", "reviewerID": "A23HO29W4QFUJ6", "asin": "B0000222Y9", "reviewerName": "Jagadeesh Subramanyam", "reviewText": "Good Product", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1465862400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2016", "reviewerID": "A68516D6PCE16", "asin": "B0000222Y9", "reviewerName": "CyberDyneSystems", "reviewText": "One of the best block sanders ever designed.

Using self adhesive rolls that fit both sanders, and a dispenser system, there was no longer a need for using the clamps on the sander to adhere paper, making paper changes a matter of seconds.\nThis innovation was HUGE, and was carried over to the new \"Random Orbit\" sanders in the form of self adhesive disks. The self adhesive sandpaper took the market by storm, other manufacturers had to follow to compete. The now common Velcro backed papers/systems soon followed. to date, the self adhesive standard width rolls remain the most cost effective quick change sandpaper system available.\n\nAt this point in time I own 6 of these sanders and another 5 of the larger 1/2 sheet 505 models.

It uses a \"key\" to open a spring held brace that secures the sandpaper on either end. My old one never loosened under 25 years of use. I also save money by purchasing the larger single sheet paper and cutting them into quarters. I also never replaced the pads because they were so durable. I used to snag and rip the paper on splinters but the pad wore very little. This sander is not as light as most on the market, but I feel that it aids in sanding because it adds the pressure you need to do the job. The motor doesn't bog down very much with heavier pressure.

I have used the 340 often and never felt I needed anything more for he limited amount of time I used a palm sander. Recently I began using the sander to sand Christmas ornaments. I found it perfect for the task, my R.O.S. was too aggressive. After getting bored with the frequency of changing between 150 and 220 grit paper I decided to buy a second sander. My initial plan was to buy another PC palm sander, currently the PC 380. As I researched online I noticed the overwhelming positive reviews of the PC 330. I decided to try it. I figured I could compare it to my 340 and If I did not feel it was worth the extra cost I could always take it back. I of course did not return the 330, I am considering buying a second one. The quality of the tool is obvious when you pick it up. Using the 330 Speed-Bloc in an enclosed garage is a substantially improved experience, if only for the comparably quiet operation. The weight of the sander aids in the ease of operation as well. I have found that less pressure is required to get an ornament properly sanded, less time as well. Other than the added cost, which appears well justified, I can find nothing to complain about, I have had no difficulty changing paper. I have just applied pressure with my fingers to the clamps, I have not used the provided tool yet.

Greene", "reviewText": "Update (2014): I still have two of these. They sit more than they get used. They are top notch tools of the highest quality. No changes to add to the review below. Just letting you know that the tools and myself are still valid and this tool is still available new.\n\nOriginal review (2002):\nThis machine works but is heavy, like other reviewers said. Myself and my coworker are each 6 foot tall men in good condition. We can barely put in 6 hours a day with the tool and that includes two half hour breaks to allow for muscles to stop spasming.\nBUT--if used correctly, this tool does remove paint. It is slow, paint dust goes everywhere, and you must wear a respirator mask and a face shield.\nContrary to the instructions included with the tool...--read this carefully--There are little adjustable rails on the left and right side of the disc. The rails can be lowered and raised to adjust the angle of attack of the disc. I found that the \"cutting\" side rail (leading edge rail) of the grinder needs to be set to about 1/16 inch above the grinding disc (leaving 1/16th inch of exposed disc to do the cutting) and the back side rail (trailing edge rail) needs to be about 1/16 of an inch TALLER than the total depth of the paint you are removing. (The back rail should ride along the painted surface, keeping the trailing edge of the disc off of the paint by 1/16th inch.) In my case I am removing approximately 1/8 inch of paint (typical for an 80 year old house). Therefore the trailing edge rail should be set 3/16th lower than the disc, leaving the trailing edge of the cutting disc suspended, by the rail, about 1/16th inch above the painted surface. The cutting edge (leading edge) of the disc is exposed, preventing the rail from riding along the painted surface, about 1/16th of an inch.\n\nThe measurements are made by laying a straight edge (I use a square) across the disc and raising and lowering the black rails to the appropriate height. This is very easy.\n\nPlan on using an inconspicuous place on your house and practicing for about 2 or 3 hours until you get it right. Don't give up. My first day was very frustrating. Lots of clogging. At first I could only use the tool for about 10 seconds before it totally gummed up. Uggh. But with practice, clogging (gumming) is actually quite minimal when you find the right \"angle of attack\" for your application. Gumming usually occurs when you hold the grinder in one place too long or try to cut too deeply in one pass. You can't expect to realistically remove more than about 1/64 of an inch per pass, maybe even as little as 1/128 of an inch per pass. This equates to about 4-6 passes, sometimes up to 10 passes for severely cupped and warped wood. But this type of use allows for almost constant grinding with very little gumming. When the tool does gum up use a small, wooden-handled ice-pick to \"pop\" the gum chunks off of the grinding disc. A cleaning session takes about 1-2 minutes or even less. An occasional brushing with a wire brush helps prevent re-gumming on paint covered, problem spots on the disc. This technique works so well that I only change the disc when the teeth wear down and stop cutting effectively (4-8 hours of use, depending). I have only soaked the discs in mineral spirits one time and generally find it unnecessary.\nBeware--this tool pulverizes the paint into a fine powder that goes everywhere. You will need ridiculous amounts of plastic drop cloths and bricks to hold them in place. Then you must sweep the powder at the end of each day. The amount that you collect is astounding. You can expect to collect about 10-20 gallons of paint powder from an average, 3BR/2Bath, one level home. This must be done for both legal and ethical reasons. Would you actually dump 10-20 gallons of lead and enamel paint into your yard?\nIn closing--this tool works great. It is a bear to use. You must use scaffolding. It is slow. Expect about three weeks of all day work to get your old house scraped and ready to prime. Buy lots of discs, about 10 for an average size house. Use only the 24 grit as the discs wear out and you need all the cutting power you can get. But beware as a new 24 grit disc cuts viciously and leaves severe swirl marks. But after about 10 minutes of use it wears down to a manageable level.\nIf you can afford it--replace your siding. New poplar siding is about 15 cents a foot (in 2005. Prices fluctuate) in the US. Materials for an average home would cost about $4,000. Plus lots of labor. Vinyl siding is usually a poor choice. It costs $5,000, looks fake, and causes weird moisture issues between the vinyl and the old siding.\nBut if you, like me, have little money and lots of time--this is the tool for you.\n(note: I post my reviews because I take them seriously and I take other people's seriously as well.

It can be used to round sharp edges and get into difficult spots as well as the normal flat surfaces. The true orbit speed leaves a satin smooth surface without swirl marks on soft or hard wood. The old sander is now vibrating more than it should so I plan on having it reconditioned and the rubber posts replaced. I'll be happy to keep the old friend as a spare!

I found that the house had been at least 7 different colors in it 75 years. When using the the stripper  I also used a full face shield and a resperator along with a long sleeve shirt and I put a bib on so that i wouldnt have paint going down my shirt. I also found that the metal disc. would sometimes clog with paint, so I would take a propane torch and burn the paint of the disc and then continue on. I did end up wearing one disc plum out and so I bought a new disc to finish up with. The stripper is a little heavy and your arms are going to get tired but my wife used it after I suspended it with 4 long bungee cords above the location she was working. The bungee cords helped suspend the tool and take the weight off the user. Anyway, the tool is very well made and plenty powerful and it beats trying to use an acid stripper. I will probably use it next to strip the paint off the cabinets in the old house and then make new doors. I can see where a home owner buying an older house could really save alot of money buying this new tool. I build high end custom furniture so i really nit pick my tools not only in there upkeep but in their performance as well and i don't keep any tool that doesnt perform.

I've been disappointed in two ways. First, the mounting is not nearly as positive as I would hope. Even with the screws firmly affixed, there is still a small amount of play between the guide and the router. This does not inspire confidence, and creates accuracy problems when using the guide fully extended. There's really no excuse for this, it's just poor QA. While you might expect some play from generic stuff, a brand-new Porter-Cable brand attachment ought to fit a brand-new Porter-Cable router snugly. Aside from the attachment interface, the quality of this attachment is very good, and the design thoughtful. Functionally, it has some limitations, which is my second qualm. I've found that the relatively small contact surface makes it difficult to keep this running flat again smaller stock, especially anything rougher. The contact surface thoughtfully includes holes for screwing in a board or a plastic block in order to make this surface larger, but this still won't help you with thiner pieces of work. If you are trying to rout both edges it is a real challenge to keep this small guide surface from riding up and ruining your work. Now, this really shouldn't shock anyone, I am describing a scenario where a table-mounted router is obviously the right tool for the job. But if you are hoping that this can give you router table functionality in an inexpensive package that you can easily carry with you, be aware that this is not the case.\n\nOverall this tool is great for certain applications, especially any work you need to do in place, where a router table is not an option. It's a good design overall, and rate as a 4-star tool by me if not for the play in the attachment interface.  I'd suggest potential buyers think about what they intend to use this attachment for.

The quality & design of this edge guide shocked me. It could have easily had more than an additional 2\" of travel with a simple design change.

The pins that adapt it to the router are .014\" under size and the spread between the mounting holes on the router are .025\" more on the base than on the pin location on the edge guide. Now when you tighten the screws to fasten the router to the edge guide, they will cant the pins so they are not clamped parallel to the holes. This is shoddy quality control. Even the screws are an obsolete size which hasn't been used much for more than 25 years. The screw size by the way is #12-24. Most think it is a 5mm, but it is not. I make the assumption they got an extremely good price on these obsolete screws. These damned screws if you can find them are over $2 per screw at a place that sells parts for this edge guide online.

What I found is that the guide takes my 690, which serves as my simple lightweight hand tool, and makes it a bit awkward and weighty. Admittedly it is more accurate once set up, but so is my older, far less flashy edge guide once I get it set up. Think of it as one step forward, two steps back.\n\nAnd the real truth is that relying on a heavy aluminum straight edge guide or using bits with standoff bearings really does everything I need. A lot of your reaction to this guide will be determined by how you work. For me, nearsighted and chubby, it forces me to far back from the edge to feel comfortable. Someone who is comfortable working a router from the side might think this is the cat's pajamas.\n\nWhich brings up my final point.

Most of  the other 3 hp models will only handle 2 1/2\" diameter bits. This is  good if you want a router to use on a table to run panel bits or large  moulding bits.\nThe router's downfalls are that it doesn't lend itself to  be conveneint to use on a router table. The plunge lock lever needs to be  pushed and held all the time while you are adjusting the depth. Makes you  wish you had a third hand. It also does not have a shaft lock, so bit  changes require two wrenches.\nIt does have a trigger switch that is  handle mounted. (a must have for any router) and you can order a dust  attachement from Porter Cable to hook up to your shop vac.\nWhat I've  learned about this router is that you need a second router to do hand held  work for trimming laminate and doing small routing work.

If you have a garage shop as I do, you'll have to keep it in the house until you use it.\n\n2) No dust extraction - use a downdraft table, mask, etc.\n\n3) If you are not using PSA or hook-loop, you probably will want to put 3-4 pieces of sandpaper in at a time so you don't spend so much time swapping new paper in.\n\n4) The paper changing tool is something you do NOT want to misplace.  Zip tie it to your power cord.\n\n5) The paper changing tool works better if you put it in a vise and bend the top inch about ~10 degrees.\n\n6) The sander is taller than most 1/4 sheet sanders - this can make it harder to get into corners or small spaces.\n\n7) \"Break\" your paper to improve it's life (run it across an edge to flex the grains)  This also makes it easier to fold and tear", "summary": "Some tips on the quietest, most comfortable sander...", "unixReviewTime": 1259625600}, {"overall": 1.0, "vote": "9", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2008", "reviewerID": "A1Z0TFQT6QOC1F", "asin": "B0000222Y9", "reviewerName": "Herbert C.

The old 330 has a metal housing, where as this one is plastic. Granted, on a cold day the plastic is probably more friendly, but I like the feel of the metal housing better.\n\n2.) The new 330 isn't made in the U.S.A., where as the old one is. For the price, it should be made here.\n\n3.) The new 330 is rated at 14,000 RPM, where as the old one is 15,000. This probably makes the brushes and bearings last longer, although the brushes don't seem to be the same quality as on the older unit. Either way, the extra 1,000 RPM helped a lot when trying to avoid swirl marks with a course grit. The 340 is also 14,000 RPM, but 1/2 the price.\n\n4.) The new 330 isn't counter-balanced as well as the old, perhaps because of the lighter plastic case.\n\n5.) The 330 doesn't have a dust collection system, unlike the 340. Granted, if you buy a 330 you probably have a downdraft table and don't want the drag of the vacuum hose to interfere with the feedback of the sander, but it would still be nice.\n\n6.) You pretty much need the tool to install the sandpaper. Everyone I know (including me) who has a 330 uses PSA paper because of this. Bosch has an ideal setup on their 1297DK, which is also a nice sander, but 12,000 RPM.\n\nWith that said, this is still the best unit available for purchase that I've found. The hand grip is very comfortable, it's fairly quiet, and the vibration is low enough to not cause numbness after extended periods of sanding.

Today I am still using that same router.  I purchased a milling machine that works with a router.  I went to a local tool shop and told them I needed a strong router that would need to run for long periods of time.  They told me PC was a workhorse and probably the only router that could take such abuse.  They did not lie.  I have milled 5 - 6 foot long, 6\" diameter posts with this router making spiral plunge cuts.  I have run this baby for sometimes 10 minutes non-stop -- often -- and she never gives up.  I was so impressed I purchased this router for my table as well.  I use the table more than the milling machine -- raised panels doors mostly.  The one in the table lasted 5 years without ever changing the brushes.  What killed it was the freak flood during Hurricane Ike.  I live in Texas along the gulf coast.  I got 2-1/2 foot nasty water in my garage -- enough to submerge the motor.  I did not think to take the router out of the table before evacuating.  But even so, when I got home I plugged it in just to see if it would work.  I could hear the motor winning but no spin.  I gave the arbor a good tap with a hammer and guess what -- the router started spinning.  I could not believe it.  I sprayed it down (the motor, through the vents) with w-d 40 and set out to see how long it would last.  I got a whole year out of it!  But finally the corrosion won and she died for good.  So now I will purchase another one and next time I have to evacuate I will make sure to pull it out of the table and tuck it away in the attic. I have no idea if Porter Cable has continued the excellent construction of this router or if they have cheapened it, but I will find out with this new one.  I will stick with what I know, and if they fail me, only then will I look elsewhere.\n\nI am back a little more than 2 years since I bought this router and it is holding up very well.  I've used bits up to 2 inches in diameter for raise panel work and the router has done great.  The one that I had on my milling machine is still there and still working!  It sat unused for a whole year and I just recently fired it up to mill finials for some gable trim I am currently making.

I thought maybe the spindle had runout, but I tried a quality collet/nut from Precise Bits and the issues went away entirely. Now this thing runs beautifully.\n\nRunout isn't a huge deal with short/low diameter bits (as long as we're not talking about very small bits which may be broken by it), you may not even notice it.. But when you throw a raised panel or rail/stile bits in, get ready for some serious vibration. Also, if you do Incra style dovetails or box joints, any runout is going to make your cuts wider than they should be. With dovetails this makes it impossible to get a consistent dovetail tightness based on depth of cut.. so if you change bits and go back and try again with the same DOC, your results will be different. Sure you can cut test pieces every time but that's a huge waste of time and wood. I could never understand why I was having such issues and then discovered runout was the problem. Any dados you cut with a specific width bit will be wider as well.\n\nThe ultra precision collet set from Precise Bits makes the world of difference, plus the collet never sticks and requires you to back the nut off to get the release to pop.. just wiggle the bit and it slides free. It really brings this machine up to a pro level quality.\n\nHopefully most others have a good collet on their routers.. or don't do anything with it that requires high precision.

It worked, but I doubt it would survive the experience. This one, having the same power (amperage) as my Bosch table saw, glides right through maple. Someone mentioned the poor R&D response by PC to several issues with this router. I have not had a problem with the mode of adjustment, without a router lift, and with a mirror it is highly accurate and easy. But I do have an issue with the speed control slider switch. This is not a good arrangement as constantly I am finding myself bumping it when turning the router on and off, and it easily will unintentionally change to a different speed when touched while adjusting height. It simply is an inferior design for a router table set-up. The on and off switch also is not ideal for a router table set-up as you find yourself groping around, under the table, to find the switch. An auxiliary paddle safety switch is a very good idea which will take care of both these issues, until you again need to adjust the height by groping around under the table. Changing bits is not that difficult: one wrench under, the other wrench above the table. Easy.\n\nRegarding the comments about it being difficult to release bits from the collet. I learned a trick that may help and has totally alleviated any problems for me. Loosen the collet to where you can turn it with your fingers. Then when you meet resistance loosening it with your fingers, use the wrenches again to back off a little more, loosening the collet further. Voila! The bit slides right out. This is a great tip!\n\n4 1/2 stars, the 7518 loses 1/2 star for the poor slider switch and less than ideal on/off switch location.\n\nIncidentally, me a router lift is no more than an extremely expensive and unnecessary (unless you are a production shop) item. $300 for a wee bit of convenience doesn't cut it for me unless I find a smoking deal on one. Plus, the bending over or squatting to change settings or bits is much-needed exercise! 1/64th inch incremental changes in bit height are a piece of cake with this router, without a router lift.", "summary": "DIYer.", "unixReviewTime": 1422576000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2015", "reviewerID": "A2EYLHNNCG559T", "asin": "B0000222V3", "style": {"Style:": " Router"}, "reviewerName": "The New Mexico Man", "reviewText": "Workhorse!", "summary": "Workhorse", "unixReviewTime": 1421539200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2014", "reviewerID": "A2WPFMFICHWLGB", "asin": "B0000222V3", "style": {"Style:": " Router"}, "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "reviewText": "Have this work horse permanently mounted on my Jessem table.

The speed fluctuates and/or stalls, both loaded and unloaded. After seeing the price for the speed control module # 875087 (~$100) I decided to try to replace the bearings first (~$30). The bearings have been ordered through Amazon. The upper bearing (# 330003-75) comes off pretty simply.  But to remove the  lower bearing (#146555-01), how does the chuck (part 83) come off the shaft to allow removal of the lower bearing and getting the shaft assembly out of the lower metal housing?\n\nRead another review that talked about speed fluctuations from sawdust buildup in the speed module. I'll try cleaning it out before I put it back together. Regular internal clearing may be needed as part of routine maintenance as the top/motor cover comes off easily. Also note that the brushes can be readily checked/replaced at that time.\n\nverygooddog's \"5\" star review reply comment says:\n\"I haven't had to replace bearings on a 7518, but there is a very good description of how to do it at reproductionwoodworks.blogspot.

I used an impact wench with a 1 1/8\" socket while a friend held the stator end with a leather glove on.

I wanted a powerful, precise motor capable of driving both large diameter panel raising bits and very small precision bits.\n\nThe first thing I did after I unpacked the 7518 was to set it up to measure the Total Indicated Runout (TIR) of both the spindle and the collets.  I was surprised to find a runout of 0.0015\" on the spindle, which IMO, is not acceptable.  I was even more shocked when I measured the runout of bit shanks held by the collets.  Bits held in the 1/2\" collet had TIR ranging from 0.006\" to 0.012\".  Bits held in the 1/4\" collet had TIR ranging from 0.002\" to 0.005\".  Again, this is not acceptable IMO.  The problem with excessive runout is that at the speeds these motors turn, it produces vibrations that can make the router difficult to control, noisy and cause the bearings to fail prematurely.  It can also cause bit breakage if the TIR is 10% or more of the bit diameter.\n\nI consulted with someone in the industry who has a great deal of experience with PC (and other) motors and collets.  He had never seen a 7518 with a TIR as high as I had measured.  So, I guess it was either an anomaly or my measurement was off.  He did agree that the TIR I had measured for the PC collets was typical of what he has seen.  I decided to return the 7518 for a replacement.\n\nThe replacement arrived a few days later. Thank you Amazon for shipping the replacement before receiving my return.  This time, my measurement of the spindle TIR was less than 0.0005\", so I figured the first one was just a bad apple.  The 1/2\" collet that came with the router was no better than the first one, with TIR's measuring up to 0.012\".\n\nThere is another problem with the PC collets.  I had a great deal of difficulty getting bits in and out of the 3 examples I received (two 1/2\" and one 1/4\", which I ordered separately).  The final straw came with the last bit I tested on the second 7518 I received.  It was a brand new, 1/2\" shank Whiteside bit, with the protective coating still in place, covering the cutting edges.  I struggled to get it into the collet and when I tried to remove it, I had to use so much force that the protective coating came off the bit and my thumb slid along the cutting edge, cutting it very deeply.  After dealing with the medical emergency, I looked closely at the interior bore of the collet with a loupe.  I was surprised to see a significant number of burrs attached to the slots in the bore.  I went to work on the collet with needle files and some 1000 grit wet/dry paper and eventually got it to the point where I could get bits in and out without too much trouble.\n\nI was so disappointed with the PC collets that I replaced them with after market collets made by precisebits.com.  I won't go into detail here, but these collets have about one tenth the TIR of the PC collets and are truly precision parts.  Check them out if, like me, you find the PC collets lacking.\n\nMy experience so far with the 7518 motor couldn't be more different than my experience with the PC collets.  It has the power to do anything I've asked of it.  With the new collets, it runs very smoothly.  When I run large diameter bits, it's also noticeably quieter than with the PC collets, although it's still a pretty noisy machine.  Hearing protection required.\n\nSince I immediately installed the 7518 in the router table I haven't used the base that comes with it, so I can't comment on it.\n\nI was in a quandary about the number of stars to award the 7518.  I decided not to penalize it for the lousy collets, since I'm not going to use them.  I do like the motor and decided to give a split rating in the title.

I have two of their H/L 8 hole orbital sanders, there older model two base router kit, two belt sanders and their 5\" orbital 1/4\" right angle sander. I have used these products a lot and they have not let me down. So, after my old and discontinued Sears Craftsman Professional 3 1/2 hp plunge router was dying I decided after a lot of research to buy this router. I mainly use these routers in tables that I have built with products from Rockler. I decided on this style instead of the Bosch because I was tired of dealing with a plunge style router (even though you can dissengage the mechanisim on Bosch's) and wanted to go with the twist style like my 1 1/2 hp porter cable router. First impressions when I received it was how heavy and solid it felt. I didn't like the bolt design to unlock and lock the router but I was okay with it initially. Besides the bolt I also noticed that the speed selection switch seemed a little too loose for my liking. Nothing of a big concern, but wished it had a difinitive clisk on each speed (maybe too picky). Now I had it in my router table and was using it to make 48 42\" high raised panel doors for a customer. The rails and stiles were poplar and the panels were MDF. My bits were Freuds and the panel raising bit had an undercutter. I bought two of these. The rails and stiles went well, but I did notice how the motor would wind up and down when the wood was going through the bit. No issues other than that for this part, but it went down hill from there. When using the panel raising bit I chose to make three pasess at the proper speed so I would not tax the motor too much. I had dust collection above and below the router at all times, especially with MDF. About 1/3 into the panel bits the router was sounding rough. Every 8 panels I would let the router cool down and I would vacumn out and around the router, but after the second batch of panels it sounded like the bearings were getting rougher. Needless to say when I finished the next day my new router was sounding bad. I finished the job and was finished with the router. Under warranty, it is now being fixed at my local PC dealer. I called amazon and since it is past the 30day policy they would only refund me 80% of the total bill. I am very bummed out about this and hopefully I just got a lemon, but my old router served me for 14 years of light to moderate use and never had a motor problem. Oh well, I have to wait and see from here.\nUPDATE.....03/21/14\n  While my router was out getting fixed under warranty I needed a 3hp router to continue with my projects and decided on a Bosch and I am happy I did.  I will write a review for it soon, but it is smoother, quieter (just a little), and has some great features for a plunge router this size.

Those are distinct advantages in many situations, such as using it vertically or over your head, or when cutting trim-sized stock.  On some jobs it's just more practical to use a small saw.  It's also safer than a large saw because it's lower torque means a reduced chance of the saw getting away from you.  E.g., my wife wouldn't use my [huge] worm-drive or standard-sized circular saws, but this one is perfect for her.\n\nI've been happiest with this saw since a carbide blade was installed some years ago.  Although this is a terrific TRIM saw, I wouldn't recommend it for the ONLY circular saw in your toolbox.

With tools like this that I love, will never sell or trade, and don't ever want stolen, I give them some identifying mark. This little guy has three red letters on it: T A Z.\n\nThe sealed bearings are smooth and accurate, so bits run true and stay sharper longer.\nThe collet is accurately made & the lock is SOLID, so bits stay put, don't wander, flex or slip.\n\nThough I only rarely use it hand-held, those large, wide handles are a help when taming this much torque. The \"soft-start\" feature is definitely a good thing for this bad-boy!\n\nIf you do mostly hand-held operations, you might want to consider something lighter. Both Bosch and DeWalt make good routers in that range. Of course, Festool is an option if money is no object. Personally, I think this is a bargain compared to what they ask for those Teutonic tools.\n\nAlso, you should consider making or buying a broader base for hand-held work with this. The stock base is big compared to most routers, but the machine sure benefits from having my homemade base. (one-foot square, 3/8\" thick lexan)\n\nSomething this big is best in a STURDY router table, particularly if you install an accurate motorized lift. You will need a STOUT table to resist cabinet-drop since this beast is heavy. I'd recommend a heavy rigid cabinet too, since this develops plenty of centrifugal force and push-back when routing hardwoods like Oak. Use THICK commercial hold-downs and feather-boards with this. Don't stand in the line-of-fire. Use lower speeds for big bits. I haven't had any problems, but I am VERY careful. You wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of a kick-back from this mule.\n\nThe ribbed baseplate acts like a \"mending-plate\" when installed under a table, which helps rigidity near the base, but make sure you reinforce the areas around the plate since it is heavy and develops terrifying torque.\n\nBecause it is so strong, you might be tempted to hog wood too fast. Don't...\n\nWhen you factor in the weight of hefty-hardwoods (or wet construction lumber) the torque of big-bits this can handle, PLUS the serious power it puts out, there are TONS of forces at play. All, I'm saying is: don't put this thing in a $90 home-center table. Seriously, I think it could rip mounting screws out of MDF!\n\nWith reasonable depth-of-cut, a sturdy-straight fence and safe feed-speed, this thing cuts wood like butter. Obviously, you need good bits for best cut-quality. Use good bits, some judgement and don't get power-mad. You can see silky-smooth cuts in any wood. This will run all day, so carbide bits are best. I get good results with Whiteside solid carbide bits.\n\nI use this with LARGE 3\" molding-bits for HOURS, and it never chatters, bogs or bakes. I have had to replace the brushes once in four years. (PC PART # N031634) They cost $14 dollars and are available from any real PC tool dealer, though I have seen them cheaper on Ebay.\n\nAs a guy who occasionally repairs routers (and other tools) for friends, I can tell you this is a well-designed, high-quality tool, reminiscent of the \"old days\" when all American tool manufacturers built heavy-duty stuff for years of use. It's the Harley-Davidson of hand-held routers; simple, over-engineered, easy to fix.\n\nA buddy used mine for rounding, profiling and chamfering ALL the lumber on his fancy Teak deck-project; a job that would KILL most routers. It came back rarin' to chew more lumber, even though he ate-up two solid carbide bits!\n\nIf you need reliable RAW POWER for a router table, but don't have 220 volt wiring, or often need to use your router table for big jobs at a site with only 110v, this is the Monster-Truck of table-mounted routers. On a gas-generator for portable power, this can actually dim work-lights when it starts! Therefore, use a THICK SHORT power cord.\n\nThis thing has balls, class and MASS.

And for the 70+ years that my family was in the industrial construction business, we used a lot of Porter Cable tools (when they didn't sprout legs and walk off).  So, when I learned that Porter Cable had been swallowed up by Black and Decker, I felt a little ill.  Because of the B&D connection, when I recently needed a router to hang under my Kreg table&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kreg-PRS1040-Precision-Router-Table-System/dp/B00002240Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kreg PRS1040 Precision Router Table System</a>&nbsp;,  I started looking for anything but this router.\n\nHowever, after a lot of looking, it became clear that this is the de facto standard, and that lift makers pretty well assume that this is what you will use.  I did give a lot of thought to the Bosch, and I could have gotten pads for it to fit my lift&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kreg-PRS3000-Precision-Router-Table-Lift/dp/B002YIG578/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kreg PRS3000 Precision Router Table Lift</a>&nbsp;, but the pads that come with the lift are for the PC 7518.  Besides, I plan to do some things which could benefit from the additional power of the PC.\n\nI don't see a lot of point in dwelling on what's good about this router, others have covered that, it is the standard, it is powerful, and it does not mind being run while hanging from the ceiling by its' toes (I'm told that they built it to run well upside down because they wanted to get good market penetration in Australia - but that could just be a rumor).\n\nI bought the 7518 instead of buying the motor by itself in case I ever had a reason to run it out of the table.  But honestly, I'm just a belt and suspenders guy, I can't imagine ever using it outside of the table - it is just too big a beast, and what would I ever do outside of the table that requires this much power ? (Brief pause while someone tells me what I would do outside the table that requires that much power.)\n\nI do not like the way the speed control is implemented.  Many years in the electronics field has left me with a real dislike of slide switches.  I think of them as a failure waiting to manifest itself.  And while I admit there may be some benefit to a stepped speed control in my application, I have a preference for continuously variable controls that I can tune to find the \"sweet spot\" for what I am doing.  As expensive as this unit is, I would like to have seen a solid state control.  If Porter Cable wanted to really address the upside down under a table market, a plug in remote speed control with continuously variable speeds and an rpm display would be the cat's meow.  Just make sure it is the real RPM, and not some fake number.  This wouldn't be a difficult improvement for PC to make, in fact, I have considered modifying my router to add it myself. Of course, when you have Black and Decker running the show, and you are selling the 7518 very successfully without it, why would you bother to update the product?\n\nSo, now that I joined all the other lemmings in going over the PC 7518 cliff, I'm pretty happy with it.  I wish the 1/4\" collet had been included, but I realize that this thing is capable of destroying a 1/4\" bit if you aren't careful, so maybe that was the logic.  I ended up putting a quick change on mine, so I have to use a collet adapter now anyway.\n\nThe worst thing about this router is that when you go to order parts on-line, you discover the terrible truth of what you bought - the parts department isn't Porter Cable, it is DeWalt !  Given the terrible reputation of Black & Decker / DeWalt service, I was pretty horrified to make this discovery.  The salesmen at one of the nearby \"Orange Big Box\" stores have repeatedly warned me about the bad service from these folks, and of course, DeWalt is one of their big brands (they recognize me as a very frequent repeat customer, so I get the \"come over here a minute - whisper, whisper, whisper\" dope, not the official party line).\n\nWould I buy this router again? Yes, absolutely.\n\nBut, if there was a comparable router with the the features I've talked about, or which simply was not a victim of the Black and Decker/DeWalt evil empire, would I pick it over the PC ?

I don't understand that comment, unless Porter Cable has used different plates.  The sole plate on my saw is very stiff steel, 1/16\" thick - rolled at the edges for strength, and is attached to the saw in four places - it doesn't flex and works exactly as expected.\n\nThis is a lightweight; very portable and maneuverable saw; having less torque & power than a full-sized circular saw.  Those are distinct advantages in many situations, such as using it vertically or over your head, or when cutting trim-sized stock.  On some jobs it's just more practical to use a small saw.  It's also safer than a large saw because it's lower torque means a reduced chance of the saw getting away from you.\n\nI've been happiest with this saw since a carbide blade was installed some years ago.  Although this is a terrific TRIM saw, I wouldn't recommend it for the ONLY circular saw in your toolbox.  This is because maximum cutting depths are too shallow for 2x4s and other thicker stock, and because it cuts much slower (on heavy stock) than a bigger, more powerful, saw.

I selected the PC 7518 router because of the power, favorable reviews and other recommendations.  I mounted it in a Bench Dog Pro Lift and mounted that in a Bench Dog ProTop router table and used Freud bits including a 3.5 in. raised panel bit with a back cutter.  This set up breezed through the rail and stile cuts like butter with 1 pass and made very smooth cuts.  The cuts were so precise that no sanding was required where the rails and stiles were joined.  The raised panel bit also generated very smooth cuts but I would recommend 3 passes for safety and a better result.  I was using the set-up on a 15 amp line in the garage (it is a 15 amp tool) with a shop vac to suck up the dust and boy does MDF generate dust.  After blowing the circuit breaker a few times (using the panel cutter), I moved the vac and work lights to a different circuit and that solved the circuit breaker problem.  However the router still shut down if the cut was too heavy or the feed too fast.  It was easily re-set by simply unpluging and repluging the power cord.  Since this was my first major router project, I attribute this to \"operator error\" hence the 3 pass recommendation for the raised panel cutter.  That cutter really pushes this router to its limits and once I got the hang of it, it performed really well.  However if your looking to do a raised panel with 1 pass in MDF, get a shaper.  The end result is that I have a very happy wife who loves her wainscoting.\n\nThis router is pretty heavy and is primarily intended for a router table which is where I plan to leave it.  I'll use a different and lighter router for hand held router work.  All and all, I'm extremely pleased with the PC 7518 and have no reservations in recommending it for use in a router table.\n\nRelative to the recommendations of some that a used shaper might have  been a better approach, have you ever priced shaper cutters relative to router bits?  They are a lot more expensive.  Also shapers are not easily moved from the basement to the garage for a project.  If I were a production shop, then a shaper makes sense.  Since I'm not, the router table approach is the more flexible and cost effective approach for me.

They weigh about 13 pounds, and using them is almost like weight training. That may be what you need in a production environment, where you'll beat the router to heck, but it's overkill for a home shop. For handheld use a 12A handheld router is plenty. The primary application for a 15A router is panel raising with large bits, an operation that should never be performed hand-held. (The Ampere rating is an indication of the power the router can safely deliver on a continuous basis without burning out. It doesn't describe the power the router normally draws, just the peak power it's capable of. With smaller bits, you'll never need the kind of power that a 15A router can deliver.)\n\nThe chief reason most of us would buy one of these routers is to use it under a router table. In my opinion, the best way to do that is to mount the motor in a router lift device. This enables you to adjust the router height from above the table, without lifting the router and router plate out of the table top (They're heavy and the handles nearly fill the opening, making removal awkward!) or struggling to work under the table. I recommend a router lift that can raise the collet above the table top to simplify bit changes. My choice was the Jointech SmartLift Digital. The JessEm Mast-R-Lift also raises the collet above the table, but I've never used it.\n\nEven in a router table, you need 15A only if you're routinely spinning bits larger than about 2\", which are mostly horizontal panel-raisers. A 12A router is fine for most router table use. A 12A router won't last as long if you're using large bits, however.\n\nI can't imagine why anyone but a production shop would buy the 7519. The single-speed feature may provide very slightly higher reliability but it greatly restricts the bits you can use. If you shop, there's no real difference in price between the two models. For almost everyone, the 7518 is the best choice.\n\nPorter-Cable should be ashamed for their unwillingness expend any R&D on the 7518 and 7519. Nowadays, every router has a self-extracting collet, but these are the only routers I know that don't have a locking spindle and therefore require two wrenches for bit change. (PC's latest 2 1/4 horse router has an auto-locking collet, so how primitive is one that doesn't lock at all?) I'd also blast their cheapness for not including a 1/4\" collet. The location of the power switch on top of the motor housing can be awkward, since you have to remove one hand from the handles to cycle power.\n\nWhen using the supplied base, the adjustment mechanism requires turning the aluminum-encased motor housing inside a huge aluminum screw in the base. (Few engineers would design with aluminum sliding on aluminum, particularly when the surfaces can't be lubricated.) Operation is rough and awkward, particularly under a router table. There's nothing to keep dust out of the adjustment mechanism, so the aluminum screw can collect grit, and under extreme conditions can jam. A router lift circumvents all these problems.\n\nIn summary, I recommend that you consider the 7518 and 7519 only if you'll be mounting the motors in a router lift. If you don't want to spend the money on a router lift, consider one of the newer routers that has built-in above-table adjustment. 12A routers are now available from Milwaukee (Model 5616-20), Porter-Cable (model 894PK), Freud (model FT1700VCE), and others. The Triton TRC001 is a 15A router that is reputedly excellent for use under a router table, but I haven't used it.\n\nIf you want a single router for use in router table and hand-held, buy a multi-base kit to make it easy to switch functions.

I bought the 7518 to put in my Bench Dog router table about 5 years ago.  I did lots of homework on routers and a majority rated this router high on the list for router table use.  I found that it has plenty of power to spare and will handle any bit that will fit in a 1/2 inch collet.  It has five speed settings (10,000 to 21,000 rpm) which handle all of the cutting I have ever had to do.  The on off switch is a rocker panel style (but I run my 7518 through a \"Rousseau\" switch that is mounted outside my router table).  You do not want to be reaching inside a router table to turn off the power quickly.  (The Rousseau is a better switch than the Bench Dog or any other method because it has a \"crash bar\" over the stop button that is near impossible to miss with hand or knee or anything else you might use.)  If there is a drawback to using the 7518 in combonation with a router table, it is the inability of being able to raise the moter up to change bits as some of the newer plunge routers are able to do.  (I solved this problem by purchasing the Benchdog Promax Router Lift from Amazon.  Addmittedly, I could have continued using the router plate insert and just keep taking the router motor in and out by lifting if out of the table, but the Promax solved several other issues as well, thus justifying the money spent).\nAnd, you need two wrenches (supplied by Porter Cable with the 7518) to change bits.  It would be nice if this router had a collet stop locking button, such as found on other routers like the Hitachi MV12, which requires only one wrench to loosen the collet.\n\nUPDATE 04/15/2006\nCMT has been selling an angled wrench for Porter Cable routers.

After trying out several other routers, I can say with confidence that this one will handle anything you can push through it.\nOVERALL IMPRESSION:\nI have used it for several heavy-duty projects over the past few months, routing all manner of wood species -- oak, maple, cherry, poplar, as well as several softwoods.  Whether doing edge profiles, tongue-and-groove joints, tenons, or a variety of other applications, the motor just keeps cutting without any hesitation.  And I've really put it to the test, giving it a workout in several  projects, running it continuously for over a half hour at a time, pushing one 6-foot-long board after another through it.  Then I'll turn it off, adjust the height, and run it again for another half hour of constant, heavy use.  Sometimes I even take a cut that's a little deeper than I should, but nevertheless, the motor never bogs down.\nSPECIFIC FEATURES:\nThe soft-start feature is very nice.  When you flip the power switch, it takes a moment to ramp-up, then the motor reaches its full speed with an impressive sound.  There is practically no  vibration from the motor.  The speed controls are very easy to read and easy to reach, and make it simple to adjust for the diameter of the router bit you're using.  The height adjustment is easy and locks down securely -- once the router is set for the correct height, it doesn't move until you want it to.  The wrenches that come with the router are solid tools used for loosening the collet.  The router only comes with a 1/2\" collett; if you want to use 1/4\" bits, you'll have to buy an after-market 1/4\" collett.  The motor can be easily removed from the handles if necessary.  The router was perfectly tuned when I bought it, with no runout at all, and it has stayed that way ever since, even after many many hours of heavy routing.\nSUGGESTIONS:\nThis router is pretty loud.  I would suggest wearing ear protection when running it, especially if you're going to run it for long periods of time.\nThe power switch on this router is in an inconvenient spot (like most routers).  If you're running this router in a table, I suggest using a Billy Pedal, which allows you to turn the power on and off with your foot.  This keeps your hands and face far from the router itself, and it allows you to cut the power in an emergency.\nWith a router this powerful, I would suggest you only use 1/2\" bits.  After buying this router, I slowly replaced all my 1/4\" bits with 1/2\" bits and I am much happier with them.\nCONCLUSION:\nIf you're looking for a powerful, reliable router, you'd have a hard time finding something better than this.", "summary": "Powerful and Reliable", "unixReviewTime": 1027555200}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "11", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2001", "reviewerID": "A2FP9VCXZYE4JE", "asin": "B0000222V3", "style": {"Style:": " Router"}, "reviewerName": "Jeffrey A.

These turn every one of my table saws into the effective and precision machines that they were meant to be!  I get the cut of a glue-line blade without the cost or dragging.\nIn addition, I am surprised how long they last.

The Porter Cable guides are fine, they install easily, center easily, and perform flawlessly,, Most of the time. Just once in a while though, they fail completely.

My guides often get removed from the case and hauled out to the job-sites while attached to the router.

But brass just hasn't let me down yet.\n\n Search \"brass template guide set\" and be amazed at the difference in price and the fact of the quality of these \"no-brand\" guides. Occasionally you may need to shine them up a little, but being solid brass, that's not a big problem. I've used both steel and brass on door hinge templates, dovetail templates, stair tread templates and strike plate templates. Brass just slides easier, smoother. On dovetail templates, especially plastic and soft aluminum the brass guides show less wear on the surfaces that the guides contact.\n\n I'm sorry P.C. ,,, I can't recommend these guides.\n\n I saw a review with a problem, the steel guides were too long and reached past the bottom of the dovetail template.

The P/C kit comes in a cheap & fragile hard plastic case that must have cost all of ten cents to make and the components are held in place with inexpensive cardboard separators.  In addition, after a dozen years or so, every component in my set had corroded terribly -- the metal looked similar to very old aluminum storm windows, pits and all. It's not clear why this happened, since they've never been outside the basement workshop, and no other tools corroded.  The corrosion caused significant resistance when screwing on the lock-nuts. Steel wool reduced the roughness of the corrosion, but the pieces still look dreadful.\n\nThe three largest guides in the P/C set are too long for numerous dovetail jigs, such as the Leigh jig.  It's possible to modify them to work with these jigs, by hack-sawing the excess length off the offending guides, flatten the cut end on a grinder and sanding the edge smooth.  A no-cost approach.\n\nIf you want steel guides, the Milwaukee's 49-54-0700 set comes with a nice case, and the steel finish looks a whole lot better than P/C's.  Unfortunately, the three largest guides in the Milwaukee set are also too long for many dovetail jigs\n\nIn any case, brass is a better material for guides than steel, because brass is easier on a rotating router bit if it ever touches a guide.  Once, near a day's end of routing doors for hinges, my template's locking ring came loose, allowing the guide to touch the spinning bit, and the locking ring to rub against the router-bit lock nut.  Since the guide and ring were brass, no noticeable damage to the bit or router occurred.  Had I been using any steel template with a steel locking ring, the bit or router could have been damaged.

The appropriate size guide to accomodate the size router bit, simply attaches to your plastic or metal removable center base plate, using the template guide, and a threaded metal securing ring. The gap distance between the outer edge of the template guide, and the leading edge of your router bit, is the oversize dimension you have to make your template. The template guide prevents the edge of the router bit from touching your template. The protruding nipple-collar accomplishes that.

I have not used it with a 6-inch pad, but it should work if the pad has dust-collection holes.  The edge of this shroud is quite flexible, and it can be adjusted pretty close to the pad or farther away.  I have not noticed a difference in the amount of dust collected based upon the position of the shroud, although the instructions say that it should be \"placed as close as possible to the top surface of the pad.\"  The outlet of the shroud is the Porter-Cable one-inch outside diameter standard.\n\nThe hose is 1 1/4 inch OD, with the intake fitting at 1 inch ID, so that it fits snuggly on all Porter Cable random-orbit sanders.  The hose outlet is 1 1/2 inch ID.  Both the hose inlet and outlet thread (in reverse) onto the hose, so it is easy to remove them to clean out the hose, to shorten the hose, or to make other adjustments.  The hose length is about 128 inches, without stretching, including inlet and outlet.  The small diameter of the hose makes it much more convenient to use with a hand-held sander than the larger size hoses of any of the various brands of shop vacuums, and, since it is only carrying dust, it works better as the air is moving faster.\n\nIt should be noted that the hose is longer than many of the power cords on Porter Cable Vacuums, so if using the power-triggered function of the vacuum, you may want to use a short extension cord or cut the hose shorter.  Otherwise you will constantly unplug the sander or disconnect the vacuum hose.  Tying the hose and cord together adds convenience if the hose and sander are always used together.  Velcro ties have worked best in my shop.\n\nThe adapter is perhaps the most complicated to figure out.  The small end is 1 1/2 inch OD or 1 3/8 inch ID.  The large end is 2 1/4 inch OD and 2 1/16 inch ID.  There are no instructions to tell you how to use this, only how to install the shroud on the sander.\n\nIf you have the Porter Cable vacuum (any model), remove the hose that came with the vacuum and use the converter directly in the vacuum, attaching the hose that came with the kit to the converter.  This is all friction fit, which means you can't pull the vacuum along with you as you move through your work unless you tie the vacuum hose to the vacuum.  This is easily done with a strap running around the vacuum, fastened with Velcro, and a second strap around the hose, with both straps connected.\n\nThe adapter also works to convert from my old Sears Craftsman bench belt-disk sander to the Porter Cable vacuum hose.\n\nThe Shop-Vac Universal Tool Adapter 90687 is useful for converting the hose to Shop-Vac.  It is 2 1/2 inch ID on one end with a 1 inch, 1 1/4 inch, 1 1/2 inch, and 2 inch OD on the other (or 1 1/4 and 1 1/2 ID also available in the inlet).  Thus a Shop-Vac hose can plug into the 90687 and the 90687 can plug into the Porter Cable adapter (if the 90687 is cut to its shortest length).  Or the hose in this kit can be plugged directly onto the 1 1/2 inch step of the 90687.  The 90687 cannot be plugged directly into the sander, by the way, but it can be plugged into the 1-inch dust port on the Porter Cable belt sander, although the result is unwieldy.  It can be cut down, however, to work as a transition between the Porter Cable Vacuum standard hose and the Porter Cable belt sander.  This is a vast improvement over the dust collection bag that comes with the sander.\n\nOne other hint, if you are having trouble getting a vacuum adapter to seal up properly because the male side is just a little too small for the female side, wrap layers of wide blue masking tape around the male side, adding layers until the fit is tight.  This is a surprisingly long-term fix, by the way.  Another hint is to dedicate adapters to each specific purpose and leave them with the machine, not the vacuum.  Life becomes easier when you don't have to search for a specific adapter that has fallen somewhere.\n\nSo, is there a problem with this kit?  I am not certain, but this is the second of these kits I have purchased.  The first kit had a shroud that failed.  That said, it took a long time to do it.  I was looking to see if I could figure out when I bought the first kit, but I think it was 15 or 20 years ago.  There was a life to the shroud.  The plastic turned brittle and soft and it disintegrated into chunks.  At the same time, both the hook and loop pad and the PSA pad disintegrated in the same way, along with the foam pad in the storage case.  All were stored in the metal case that came with the Porter Cable Random Orbit Sander.  I can determine nothing unusual about the environment where the sander was stored:  no chemical fumes and normal variations of temperature 50 to 100 degrees F.  So, unless there is some incompatibility between the plastics of these parts, there is a life to all of them.\n\nIt should be noted that the hose and adapter from the original kit still looks and performs great, but I now use them on a belt sander, so things work out.  It is almost as expensive, by the way, to purchase just the shroud from the parts store as to purchase this kit.  It would be great if Amazon started just supplying the shroud, as the price would become reasonable and it is the part that takes all of the abuse.\n\nI hope this information helps you out!", "summary": "Dust Collector Works Well", "unixReviewTime": 1349827200}, {"reviewerID": "A3BLPZVOZLC5TC", "asin": "B00002230Z", "reviewerName": "david b", "verified": true, "reviewText": "very nice addition to the saw,however i do not recommend the outriggers if its a saw you move alot,both outriggers add noticeable weight\n\nthe back outrigger interferes with the fence lock,when carrying the saw the rigger depresses the fence lock which allows the fence to slide,not  good as it allowed to break the flip rest feature because the fence wasn't locked for transport", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2015", "summary": "very nice addition to the saw", "unixReviewTime": 1430352000}, {"reviewerID": "A1I994ZPKUDXT9", "asin": "B00002230Z", "reviewerName": "Donald E.

I do a fair amount of refinishing, so I am constantly sanding off old finishes. I had previously tried to hook up my own dust collection system, and was somewhat successful. The problem was always finding a hose with sufficient flexibility so as not to provide resistance to free movement of the sander.\n\nAfter agonizing over spending $30+ for a piece of hose and a fitting, I finally broke down and bought one of these.\n\n=== The Good Stuff ===\n\n* The hose is a great fit for both the 1\" fitting on the side of my sander, and the hose connector on my ShopVac. It took all of 10 seconds to install.\n\n* The hose is lightweight and flexible enough (and long enough) that is was not really a hassle to use. Having a hose hooked up to the sander takes a little getting used to, but after a few minutes I barely noticed it was there. The hose is flexible enough not to knock over everything else on the workbench.\n\n* The reduction in dust was amazing. There is nothing special about my ShopVac- it is the typical $50 version from any big-box store. I would recommend using one of the filters to keep the dust from blowing straight through the vacuum and back into the room. I also have the feeling that sandpaper lasted a bit longer, since there isn't as much sawdust to clog up the grit...but I didn't measure it.\n\n=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===\n\n* The only real negative is that it is not as obvious how much material you are removing when there is no sawdust collecting on the surface. So you have to pay a bit more attention to what you are doing.\n\n* It is not a 100% solution- there is still some sawdust floating around. I would hazard a guess that 75-90% of the sawdust is collected. Of course a ShopVac is not a true dust collection system, so not sure what this hose might accomplish paired with a true dust collector.\n\n* I am sure this thing cost about $3 to make, but just hold your nose and spend the money. Getting rid of the dust is worth it, at least to me. It would also be nice if PC, or someone else, made a nice series of adapters. Every tool I own seems to come with a different size dust fitting.\n\n=== Summary ===\n\nGlad I bought it, and wish I hadn't waited so long.

It's built with typical Porter Cable attention to detail; fit and finish are nice; ergonomics are excellent.  The adjustment screw for tilting the baseplate is an especially nice touch--you pull it out and rotate it 90 degrees. It gives you that extra leverage but in a package that, when finished adjusting, springs back into a tube that parallels the motor housing.  Nice touch.  The motor is suitably strong, speed control is good.  Overall, nice features, good quality.\nI have two gripes about the saw, however.  The blower doesn't do a thing, from what I can see.  Put the switch on or off, and as previous reviewers have noted, it's a sawdust storm.  Since most of my work is outdoors, this isn't that big a deal, but if I was to use the saw indoors for finish work, I'd look seriously at the Bosch jigsaw which most finish carpenters seem to flock to.  Another gripe is the blade change mechanism.  Make no mistake, once you figure it out, it makes sense, but if you get this saw, take it home and for gosh sakes try changing the blades a few times.  Big tip to save you frustration:  The blade change mechanism is a simple spring loaded butterfly you press with two fingers to allow a blade to be removed or inserted.  Squeeze it together and it allows you to insert or remove the blade.  However:  it will only work when the shaft is at the BOTTOM of its travel.  If the shaft is in the upstroke position, the blade guard will block access to the butterfly.  So, step one is to remember:  When you need to change blades, eyeball the shaft and make sure it's at the BOTTOM of its stroke, before you unplug for the blade change.  Step Two:  Porter Cable has wisely installed a vertical slot the blade rides in to center the stroke.  When you remove the blade, make sure you pull the blade backwards (towards the slot).  Do these two steps and the blade is actually very easy to remove.  Don't do them and you'll cuss this jigsaw.\nIt's a good saw, but one reviewer stated they use it in lieu of their circular saw sometimes for general cutting work.  I work primarily in pressure treated wood and call tell you, without hesitation, that doesn't work.  It's only a 6 amp saw and PT flat out requires some force to get the saw through the wood, even with new blades.  A circular saw just eats it up when it comes to general sawing.

I compared several before selecting the Dewalt 708. The large 12\" blade combined with its sliding capability mean you can easily miter and bevel larger stock. Although it's not a true replacement for a radial arm saw it may adequately serve that purpose in your shop. It's sliding blade allows you to easily cut even large stock to length. You might think that the sliding blade will allow you to cut dados and rabbets but Dewalt does not support the use of dado head cutter blades in this saw.\nMy saw came out of the box ready to go - I checked the blade alighnment before first using it and it was perfect. There was very little lateral play in my blade - it was tight and true.\nThe motor is powerful and the electric brake stops the saw very quickly after releasing the switch. The handle is comfortable even on long days. The switch has a firm feel with a positive detent when engaged. Miter adjustments go 50 degrees left and 60 degrees right and has detented stops at about 10 different positions. Miter increments are marked clearly in an easy to read scale. Miter lock is quick and easy.\nDust seems to fly even with a good dust collection system attached to the saw's dust collection chute. I've found that if you position a hose near the rear base of the blade (careful when you're sliding) that dust collection is much better. The optional standalone dust collection bag is worthless. Although it does collect some sawdust; more of it goes airborne than is trapped in the bag.\nI bought the crown stops accessory for this saw which work adequately but are overpriced. I've used homemade jigs in the shop that worked as well or better.

Evans", "reviewText": "Since Porter Cable has pushed its 7310 laminate trimmer as its primary trim router, the 310 has become less familiar with the general public but has remained the production stop standard for professional woodworkers. With its outstanding quality and precision construction, I imagine that the $159 310 is significantly more expensive to produce than the 7310, and is thus not at a competetive price point with the $100 trimmers made by DeWalt, Bosch, and others. Those routers are OK, but they pale in comparison with the 310. See my review of the 7310 for a critique of this second-rate machine.\n\nThe 310 is a small little horse of a router. It has micro adjustment and is exceptionaly accurate. It has none of the numerous flaws that plague the 7310 and the other \"Rotozip\" style trimmers. Against the advice of my cabinetmaker colleagues, I originally purchased a 7310 as my sole laminate trimmer, thinking I'd save a few bucks. I was so unimpressed with it and its inaccurate base and adjustment mechanism that I sidelined it for 1/8\" roundover work and purchased a 310 instead. I now own three 310's and have them set up for my commonly needed tasks. One cabinetmaker in my shop has a dozen 310 trimmers. Now that's an enthusiastic fan!\n\nAs for the complaints by other reviewers about the collet not letting go of the bits, that's a problem I have not yet encountered. Sometimes I have to tap the collet with the wrench and then the bit comes right out. Of the 20 or so guys in my shop that have this router, none have complained about bits that refuse to come free. Perhaps the other reviewers left the bit in for a very long time and the bit shanks rusted to the collet??? Not sure, but hasn't been a problem for me.\n\nThe only bummer about the 310 is that PC has discontinued production of the excellent optional bases for the machine. The offset and angle bases as well as the laminate slitter are the finest available. I say \"available\" because even though they are no longer sold complete by PC, you can buy the individual parts and assemble your own, though this isn't cheap. Used and new-old-stock bases are also available on Ebay and other sources, but their relatively high prices attest to the die-hard following this router has among professional woodworkers. Don't let that put you off though, since most trim work is straight trimming and these bases are rarely needed. If you ever find that you really need, say, an offset base, go ahead and splurge on the parts and build your own.\n\nI just can't say enough about this router.

As a residential electrician and contractor is has made me quite a bit of money. The drill has cut well over an estimated 25,000 holes in 2x10 joists and 2x4 studs. It has performed beyond its design and ratings by powering 3- 1/2\" self-feed bits through doubled 2x10 southern yellow pine. Mine has reverse and the mechanical variable speeds. The die cast angle housing and collar is superior to Milwaukee's version in that it won't come loose and twist on you. It's quite a little monster workhorse.\n  I can't give it 5 stars because it has some drawbacks. Trigger variable speed would be nice because starting a 4 inch hole saw can become a bit brutal and hairy if you don't hold the drill so it will torque away from you shoud the bit become jammed. It's all or none, in or out. But I do suppose a variable trigger would sacrifice some long-term reliablility. Secondly, due to its design I cant get it into as close of quarters as I like, but I see that there is now a Dewalt available with a design that is closer.\n  Mine has only been service once, by me, for a cord changeout. (Edit: I shortened the original cord to 2 feet because I always need and extension cord anyway.) Parts seem to be readily available from Dewalt. I expect the trigger to go sometime (no matter what brand, if you use it a lot the trigger is usually the first to go behind the cord.) Trigger is $35.00 online. Comforting to know I can get service parts.\n\nUpdate: One poster mentioned the case. I neglected that part of the review. Where would this drill be without the case?

Like other reviewers mentioned, the collet did tend to occasionally seize, but I fixed this problem by applying a little powdered graphite lubricant to the collet mechanism.  Now it releases like a charm.  Use of graphite seems like a minor maintenance issue given the performance of this router.\n\nI mainly use beading, round-over, and small straight cutting bits to modify oak, poplar, and MDF trim.  The router's small size makes it easy to modify trim in place when necessary and to work on small pieces.  The base's diameter provides a really good balance between stability and small size.\n\nSince I use this router for woodworking and it spins faster than conventional larger routers, I wanted to make sure that the bits that I use could safely withstand the higher rpms.  I contacted Freud and they strictly advised me not to use their woodworking bits in it.  A Milwaukee company representative also told me not to use their bits.  People at the local Bosch service branch said that their bits would be safe to use.  When I contacted the Whiteside Machine company, a plant manager took the time to correspond with me and make some bit selection suggestions.  The Whiteside bits are not only safe at higher rpms, but Fine Woodworking magazine rated them as the best in a recent test and Norm Abram (New Yankee Workshop) recommends them too.

I tried every lubricant imaginable without success.  Once the bit is locked in, plan on keeping it in place for a while, a very long while.  I have been forced to use pliers to pry the bits out. The freezing complaint is repeated numerous times by other users.  I incorrectly assumed Porter Cable (PC) would have resolved this by the time of my purchase.\n\nI must be missing something here.

Mitre cuts, cross cuts and compound mitres in all materials is a breeze, but invest in the proper blades for the job and keep them sharp (goes without saying but I never cease to be amazed).\nMy saw is used primarily in a shop environment and mainly as a replacement for a radial arm saw (cross-cuts 8/4 hard maple like a hot knife through soft butter), honestly I cannot imagine working without it.  I had heard from other trades that the saw \"goes out of adjustment frequently\" and I must admit I have had this problem on job sites.  The primary issue is the saws weight and awkwardness in moving it around.  The four screws used to secure the adjustable platen to the saw base do loosen up with use and just picking this Mother up can effect the saws precision.  The good news is it's not a major ordeal to re-set the alignment and a little bit of lock-tite prevents the set screws from wiggling loose.  Although the saw can be placed on a work-mate (barely), I would recommend the DeWalt stand (the adjustable material supports alone make it worth the money).  And if DeWalt would just put adjustable legs or feet on this stand it would be a perfect solution both in the shop and on-site.

Very stable.\n- The electric brake is so much more convenient than I expected.  You can switch out workpieces within about 2 seconds of a cut.  Now my table saw bugs me because it takes so freakin' long to spin down.\n- It should have come with at least some worthy accessories.  The vertical clamp (DW7082) would be a good choice, IMO.\n- The dust bag is completely worthless - without a vacuum-assisted dust collection system, sawdust rockets out the back of the machine.  Even with a vacuum-assist, you'll be sweeping up afterwards.  If this is really an issue, maybe sawing isn't for you. (*laugh*)\n- The depth-stop system is shady.  If you press a little harder than \"last time\", the saw will bow down a little more.  It's very inconsistent.  Don't depend on it for a \"real\" dado.  That said, it is very convenient if ultra-consistent depth isn't important for a given task.\n- The over-45 degree angle cuts are more a marketing gimmick than really useful - it takes more than trivial adjustments to bring this setup around.  And then you have to un-do everything to get the stops back to 45.\n- When I was researching this saw, I read several complaints about the sliding arm bearings \"shifting\" or being a shaky (which would result in inconsisent cuts, of course).  These people obviously do not read manuals.  Just adjust the bearings using the tool in the back of the arm.  It takes maybe 30 seconds to do a very thorough job of getting the sliding arm very tight (tolerance) and exact.\n- Yellow is a good color for tools.\n- It comes more-or-less set up.  It's always a little disheartening to open up your new tool to discover a bunch of metal bits and a few baggies of screws.  You can make some sawdust within a few minutes of opening the box.  It did take some adjustment to get it to where I was ready to *use* it, but nothing major.  A minor point, but still pleasing.\n- The handle being perpendicular to the blade and shifted towards center makes it not only more ergonomic, but also you can cut with either hand.\n- The fences are very nice - they are tall, very sturdy and stable, and adjust/remove with only one wing-bolt.\n- Of course the dual-bevel is great (though, honestly, gratuitous - still, I'm a fan)\n- The cam-action miter base is superb.\n- The adjusty-tool stores right in the back of the arm.  Very convenient.\n- The included saw blade is mediocre.  It's great for chopping 2x4s or something, but it's not appropriate for \"pretty\" lumber.\nSo - I really like this saw.

I work on a large crew of woodworkers and we have every saw ever used on the job. I have used them all. What sets the DeWalt apart is the large capacity and ease of use.  The saw did need calibration out of the box.  There are three nuts to calibrate the 0, 45 degree left  and 45 degree right stops.  After some fine adjustments it has been cutting perfect miters for years.  The fence was not perfectly square with the blade at first.  I calibrated the fence by removing it and filing the bolt holes to slot them a little with a rat tail file.  Since the first calibration it has performed flawlessly. The dust collection is make believe.\n  Compared to the other saws in its class the Hitachi is nice but the dinky table and fence is the same as the old 8.25\" saw and very inadequate.  The bevel adjustment on the makitas has you bumping it hard to release it.  The plastic lever for the bevel on the makita is flimsy and could break. The Makita has the nicest smoothest feel and spring action though. A decent table too.\nSome reveiwers whined that the DeWalt saw could not cut square. They are the same people that leave the VCR time display blinking for years. They never bothered to read the instructions for calibration.\n  I owned a Milwawkee for a day or two.  It didn't bevel both ways and the arbor was wobbly out of the box causing the blade to cut a wider kerf.\n  Back to the Dewalt, little extras like a guard that really works, the high fence, the vernier scale and the slots in the guard to see the cut are very nice and well thought out. Guards on the other saws are see through plastic that quickly become opaque.  You then have to bend over to see the blade on the mark.  Some remove the guard alltogether after years of constant bending over. The reviewer that couldn't tighten the bevel on the DeWalt so it wouldn't move must have very very weak hands.

I've heard good things about the DW788S from a guy at work and decided to take the plunge. I ordered the version with the stand and light attachments. They came in three different packages.\nThe stand was surprisingly heavy and assembled easily. A minor detail is that when the saw is mounted it seems to be a little top-heavy. I think that if you're clumsy like me and bump into it hard, it could go over. However, it doesn't seem in any imminent danger of falling. The light assembly is sturdy and mounts easily with two screws. It does need an extra outlet to plug into.\nAs far as the saw goes, it is nice. I found virtually no vibration just like others have said. It cuts quickly and accurately. Being new to scroll saws I was amazed at how tiny the saw blade is. At first I thought it was a piece of wire in the bag of parts. I've cut some 1/2\" MDF, 1/4\" ply and some 1/2\" walnut. The cuts are smooth and as accurate as I can follow a line right now.\nOne thing I don't like is the blade attachment. There is a thumb screw at top and bottom that holds the blade. When you tighten a blade, the screw has a tendency to twist the blade out of vertical. Now I put the blade in crooked and the thumbscrew will straighten it. Like many others, I'm not too crazy about the hold down, but it does work and is actually pretty easy to adjust.\nA nice addition would be some kind of vacuum attachment.

Stock blade works well. Better, smoother result with better blade.\n  Easy to change blade.\n  Very good ergonomics on the handle and switch position.\nThe BAD:\n  Has to be careful with the fence extension when do bevel cutting.\n  Need to take the extension fence off for certain cuts.\n  Hard to read bevel scale.\n  Tape the wrench in its hole or you will need replacement soon.\n  Loud, very noisy loud.\n  Don't use top handle since it's out of balance no matter where you secure the rail.\nThe UGLY:\n  The dustport gets nothing but dusty.\n  No dustbag, well, like it works anyway. No support extension.\n  No hold-down clamp.\n>Don't take me wrong. I like DeWalt tools even often the times I found they are over priced. I do own their planer, table saw, biscuit jointer, jigsaw.

At 90 degrees, it it nearly impollible to get a straight view of the hair line in order to line it up directly on the 90 degree line. Fortunately, it is easy to use a compound square for this setting in lieu of the gauge.

You basically know that this saw will cut whatever stock you have, within reason. This is a very good tool, it is thoughtfully designed and has some real advantages and falls slightly short in only a couple of areas. The BOSCH 3915 ( 10\" SCM ) is a fine tool, but only bevels one way, its toggle clamps are quick and easy to engage ( more so than the DeWalt vertical clamps, which are still effective ).I prefer the cast in angle markers on the BOSCH over the DeWalts painted on gauge or Hitachi's C10fs which are too hard to read because they are painted the same seafoam green as the base and they are too small. The detents on the BOSCH are superb, the DeWalt's are also very good, and the Hitachi's are not as plentiful or crisp. The cam action lock down on the DeWalt is great, but the BOSCH's screw type works very well because of its large knob, much easier than the smaller Hitachi's. Regarding the cam lock on the DeWalt, I was really impressed how well it locks down even a degree or less next to a major detent. The adjustable fences on the Dewalt are superior to the Bosch's which only one side moves, and the Hitachi's are too short to be very useful. For the most part the BOSCH has a very nice base, but the direct drive motor and mount is fairly old technology. The Hitachi is a nice and fairly compact saw with a great motor, very smooth start up, but the base needs updating. The DeWalt is a great compromise. It does not fall way short in any category that I can see based on owning the other two saws mentioned. The accessories not being included is a little disappointing, I believe that for the price of this saw DeWalt could atleast include the dust bag. Generally speaking though, I believe this saw is woth every nickel when you consider the other saws are very good, but have distinct shortcomings, the DeWalt really does not in my opinion. I have mounted this saw on a mobile custom cart with locking wheels and storage beneath, I mounted the the Rousseau extensions and stop system on my cart and it is extremely solid and useful.

I upgraded from another brand and what a difference, I should have spent the extra dollars to start with, and highly recommend seriously considering this scroll saw for anybody wanting to get into scrolling, or even for those with any experience at any level.  First and foremost - blade insertion is easy and simple with just a little practice, insert the blade top first and snug the thumb screw, and if you are at 90 degrees with the table the bottom fits right in, tighten both blade screws.  The machine I moved up from had adapters for the blades, and it was a very frustrating procedure when having to poke the blade through a hole, attaching the adapter to the blade, then hooking the adapters.  With the DEWALT all it takes is turning the tension lever to the off position, releasing the top blade screw, poking the blade through the hole, then resetting the top blade, and resetting the tension.  Once you get used to it, it only takes about 5 - 10 seconds to accomplish this.  The machine is HEAVY, the table probably weighs about 50% of the total weight, and when bolted down produces very little vibration.  The instructions for putting it together are very clear, and unless you are into power lifting I recommend getting help to get it out of the box and onto the work surface.  I've been cutting out patterns in both 1/4\" and 1/2\" wood, and running at a slow speed (real curvy lines) on both thicknesses, and the machine does not bog down at all.  Overall this is one outstanding saw, and well worth the investment.  I've found that working with it is much less frustrating than my old one, and I actually enjoy working on it.\n\nI almost forgot to add something about the articulated dust blower, it's great!  You can set it to whatever position you need to blow the dust away from where you are cutting, and due to the low vibration of the machine there is no or extremely little movement.\n\nUPDATE:  I've been using this machine for five months now and couldn't be happier.  I added the light and the easy lifter, both worth the expense.  I do a lot of intricate work, and inserting the blades for inside cuts is very easy, and quick.

I have NEVER had a problem with the swivel heads.\nThese things are very durable. They have been in the dust, dropped from ladders onto semi-hard surfaces a few times, out in the snow and rain, stepped on and knocked over a ton of times - in plain English, just used and abused, but they still keep working!\nBattery life on these flashlights is about 3 hours of continuous use and I have changed the bulbs only about 3 times on each light. The light is bright enough to light up the dogs pretty well about 60 to 75 feet away - depending on the battery charge state. When we lose power I set up a couple of the lights in the house and point them at the ceiling to light up the rooms. MUCH safer than candles...\nIt may sound kind of expensive at a total cost of $94 ($25 per light + ~$60 for a battery + $3 each for the bulbs) but I figure about 1 hour use per day, per light for 10 years (and still counting) results in a cost of just 2.6 cents per hour!!! (not including the electricity cost for the charger). If you already own a Dewalt rechargeable tool, the cost of ownership drops to less than a penny per hour based on my experience.

I have posted pictures of how I set mine up.\n\nI basically threw away the instructions after reading through it once to get the basic idea of how the parts fit together. I then assembled the stationary subassembly part of the table and test fitted it to my saw. I then marked the 4 holes to be drilled and where I would need to add a horizontal brace along the lower part of the table saw stand. This brace I made out of a 2x4.\n\nI then disassembled the parts and started assembling it directly to the table. The pieces have a lot of adjustment built in by using slotted holes, so as long as you get the 4 holes drilled in the right place on the table saw, you can get it aligned. Precise alignment (as suggested in the original instructions) was not needed. You do have to be careful though to align at least one slot for your miter/cross-cut slide. I don't need both channels, but if I did I could cut out a section of the stationary table top with my router.\n\nOnce I got the metal pieces bolted in place, I again test-fitted the stationary table top piece to make the final mark for cutting off the edge so that I had clearance for the fence slide. After making this cut (allowing for about an 1/8th inch fence clearance), I assembled the stationary top in place, aligned it and checked for flatness and tightened the bolts.\n\nAdding the big folding table to the hinge was then trivial and required no adjustments or cutting. You also don't need 2 people, because one end can rest on the floor while you insert the screws. My TS300 is on a wheeled stand, so the vertical brace is not long enough. The simplest solution was to just put a wood block under the vertical brace made of glued 2x4 pieces. Problem solved.\n\nThis is a really great table extension and I'm very happy with it. It converts my TS300 into a professional level saw. The extension also doesn't get in the way of using my Bench Dog router extension. This project took 3 hours, with 1 hour spent on thinking about assembly and test fitting the pieces with 2 hours spent on actual assembly.

I took some work but its well worth it.  The small stationary support has rabbets to clear the miter slide and because its always in place its very handy for pieces less than 48\".  The flip up/down extension is great for safely and accurately ripping long boards and sheet goods.  This outfeed is an excellent buy for a small shop when you consider just the cost of the hardware.  I'm not sure way so many have received them with broken pieces.  Mine was packed well and received in perfect condition.  Maybe Delta improved the packing.\n\nYou might ask why I would go through the trouble of modifying the Delta outfeed?  Well currently the only ready made flip up/down outfeed for the Sawstop is a pivoting roller rack, which is almost identical to the one I put on my old PM66.  Its was a very sturdy unit but I didn't like the roller rack because  it let small work pieces fall through or wedge between the rollers, and I had to constantly lower it to clear the miter slides on jigs/guides.  If you forget to raise it back up, boards can and do slide back towards the blade.  Now I know that if the guard is in place this isn't a problem, but I use a lot of jigs that don't work with a guard.  That's way I bought a Sawstop which has at a riving knife in place most of the time and a blade brake all the time.\n\nThe modifications are relatively simple.  Viewing the saw from the outfeed looking towards the saw's back, there is a space between the 4\" dust connection and the conduit box where you can install the right vertical support.  By  placing the holes for the left supports an inch or two off the left edge, all the slotted brackets line up pretty good.  I am not going into detail on the dimensions because you'd need a drawing to give you every detail.  You may need to do a partial assembly to estimate the location before drilling the holes.  Just know it can be done if you use the Delta instructions and  a little ingenuity.\n\nI ripped about an 1 1/2\" off the 12\" short stationary piece to fit in between the tablesaw top and end of the Delta supports. Then chamfered the lead edge of that short stationary piece.  I did that before installation because that was mentioned in a previous review. Thanks to that reviewer for the heads-up.  I also widen the rabbet on the short stationary piece to line up with the Sawstop miter slots which differ slightly from the Delta's.

I have a Delta Unifence on my Enlon, but if you have the original Enlon fence still, then you will need to cut some of the table off to clear the back fence rail.  Better yet, upgrade the fence first.  I did need the 2 wood supports (30.125\" long in my case) but they didn't need to be 2x2 as the directions state.  I just used some scrap that was maybe 1 x 1.5.  I had to drill 4 holes in the cabinet to install the bolts as described in the directions.

The blade was rubbing on the side of the blade hole in the table. It took a bit of manipulating the two screws that secure the table to the bevel gauge but I got the blade pretty much centered.  There is no side to side adjustment to account for this.  That's just not acceptable.\n\nProblem #2.  The bevel lock knob on the saw was broken.  That had to have happened during packaging or assembly.  There was no damage to the box upon arrival and the saw was securely packed with the cardboard inserts.\n\nProblem #3.  The blade is tilted because the upper and lower arms aren't in alignment.  WTF?  Seriously.\n\nProblem #4.  The lower guard is bent and doesn't allow the table to tilt to the left.  Not a bid deal to straighten it but it should've never got thru QC like that.\n\nProblem #5.  This one's minor as I didn't expect it to do much anyway.  But the \"blower\" moves about as much air as a flea fart.  it's pretty much useless and is more in the way than functional.\n\nDeWalt gets a premium price for a HarborFreight-quality saw.

Very sturdy and stable.  The speed and blade tension levers are functional and very easy to use.  Changing blades is very easy...it takes about 5 seconds.\n\nSo...

Prior to this I had been using roller stands as out feed support when ripping long stock.  The problem with roller stands is that it is difficult to get them the exact height of the saw table, and even if you do, this won't work when ripping long stock because the stock tends to droop below the table height before it makes contact with the roller.  So now you're in a predicament. Do you continue to force the stock through the saw and hope it rides up and over the roller? Do you stop the saw and move the roller forward to support the work, only to discover that the shortened support distance from the saw table causes the stock to tip up and over like a teeter-totter when the cut is complete? Do you use several rollers in series?  The answer is none of the above, you forget the rollers and purchase an out feed table.\n\nThe potential of a good saw is either limited or fully realized depending upon the quality its side and out feed support. Therefore in addition to the out feed table, I strongly recommend purchasing the side extension table too!  With a good out feed support and side extension support, your expensive saw can do all the big jobs it is capable of.\n\n___________________________________________________\nPacking and Shipping\n\nThe packing of the out feed table was of superior quality. It came in a very heavy gauge cardboard carton.  The contents were packed well and reached my door step in perfect condition.  Many reviewers noted that their table was damaged in shipping due to less than quality packaging.  Not so in my case.  Perhaps Delta has responded to all the negative customer feedback.\n\n___________________________________________________\nAssembly\n\nOverall the design of the support structure for this out feed table appears to have been taken straight from the Rube Goldberg text book on over complicated design and difficult ways to achieve simple results.  It appears as though the assignment to design this out feed table was handed to some young mechanical engineer fresh out of college as his very first task at his new company.  Furthermore it appears that the senior engineers and management at Delta neglected to conduct any design reviews on his work.  Assembly of this table is exasperating at best.\n\nThe table has two angle braces that bolt at the lower end to the bottom of the saw cabinet, and bolt at the top end to two horizontal supports that extend from the top of the saw cabinet.  For some reason, the two bolts that are used to attach the bottom of the braces are radically different from one another even though both bolts perform the same function.  There is no mention of the reason for this in the assembly instructions.  These bolts are inserted from the outside the saw cabinet and the nuts are connected from inside the saw cabinet.  In order to connect the nuts to the bolts you have to remove the injection molded plastic motor cover.  It is almost impossible to connect the nut to the bolt for the angled support brace that is the furthest away from the saw motor cover.  The distance you have to reach into the saw base to attach this nut is much longer than my arm.  I couldn't hold the support brace with one hand and at the same time wrap my arm around the cabinet and stick my arm in the motor cover hole to attach the nut.  This is definitely a two person job, and one person has to have very long arms.\n\nSome of the previous reviewers warned about not following the assembly instruction that tells you to cut ? inch off the end of the stationary table.  I followed their advice, did not make any cuts, and the table fit perfectly.\n\nWhen the assembly of the out feed table is complete, it's clear that you will never want to disassemble it even if the saw needs to packed up for moving across the Atlantic.  The pain of re-assembly would be just too strong of a deterrent.\n\n___________________________________________________\nUsing the Out Feed Table\n\nWith that said, after the table assembly is complete the out feed table does the job for which it was intended.  I am extremely happy with it. It significantly enhances the operational capabilities my saw and it definitely increases the safety of using my saw.  The inherent difficulty of ripping long stock or 4x8 sheets of plywood essentially vanishes when the saw has proper out feed and side extension support.\n\nThe table has other uses too.  I find that when I'm not using the saw, the table comes in handy as additional work bench space.  I even use it as out feed support for my planer.\n\nAfter having used the table for a few months, I wonder how I got along without it before.  Would I purchase this table again if necessary?  The answer is yes I absolutely would.", "summary": "Now that I have it, I don't know how I got along without it", "unixReviewTime": 1145577600}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2006", "reviewerID": "A3H2K631XHHA63", "asin": "B00002234T", "reviewerName": "Walt in Pittsburgh", "reviewText": "Overall this is a nice product, but make sure you read the directions from front to back before assembling.

I have done a couple small projects and it works very well. It WAS nice and quiet.\nUntil today.\nI started hearing a knocking and recalled seeing a video on this being an issue of a screw that likes to loosen itself towards the back inside. The arm that comes off of the motor to be more precise. They say it was an issue that would need addressing every so often.\n\nWell I figured this would be my problem although it is only a month or so old with relatively light use.\nI figured I would open it up and use some loctite or a jam nut to keep me from dealing with this again.\n\nWell I open it up, (really annoys me to no end that I have to take this apart this soon.) I work on my own tools and equipment.\nI don't have the time or patience to find a repair place and wait for it to be fixed (maybe).\nI also don't want to end up with somebody else's used machine in return.\nI am a contractor so maintaining and repairing my own equipment is a no brainer for me.\n\nAny way, I get it open and find that Dewalt did in fact fix this issue. As a matter of fact they put a jam nut on the bolt.\nOk, this is not my issue because it is nice and tight.\nSo I check around inside to see what is loose or broken.\nI check all of the bolts and find that ALL 4 of the motor bolts are very loose!\nEverything else seems to be ok. We will see tomorrow. I didn't have any more blue loctite so I will get some tomorrow and put it all back together and see how it goes from there. I will put just a light touch of it on the threads. Hopefully that will work.\n\nI guess now that they fixed the one bolt from coming loose, now the motor takes the vibration and its bolts come loose. :)\nEither that or they simply did not torque them properly, in Asia of course. I have nothing against the Asian people but I see a lot of garbage work from their factories. When they first switch manufacturing over to there, things commonly go bad. Including this product. I think I read they had problems with the tables early on in the transition over to the Asian factories with this tool.\n\nAs I said I am a remodeling contractor. Most of my tools are the black and yellow, Dewalt. I would rather count how many of their tools that I do NOT have than count what I do have of theirs. I like Dewalt a lot and I have invested deeply in their tools. In general they are very good but a few of their tools I use constantly have some very glaring issues, but In general they are very good.\n\nSo as to why the 2 stars?\nI have had this this thing a very short time and I am already having to take it apart and fix it.\nThere is NO reason that these screws should be loose, especially this early on.\nRegardless of reason. Improper torquing of the bolts, lack of a thread locker, design or what have you. There is no excuse.\nThey are not the cheapest tools, they wanted to jack up their profits by moving to Asia so I give no free pass to them.\n\nSo take my review as you will, good or bad. It seems to be a good scroll saw. It has been around for a good while.\nBut who knows how yours will come. I hear the switch is pretty weak and fails a lot. I don't know. I may not know because I use a foot switch.\nBy the way, if you do get one of these, buy a foot switch. It is a no brainer and I would definitely say a necessity. Thank me later.\n\nIf Dewalt wants to reimburse me some way for having to fix this, I would change my review. I don't see that happening so it will probably stay this way.\n\nGood luck", "summary": "Issue in the first month of light use.", "unixReviewTime": 1486252800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2014", "reviewerID": "A1XQD1ZOBQE8W5", "asin": "B0000222ZP", "reviewerName": "Syracuse Pete", "reviewText": "Use it a ton.

Careful observers will notice that the base and motor are not perfectly perpendicular to one another. There is too much slop in the height adjustment mechanism and set knob. Too, the base itself is not perfectly flat (place a sheet of 400 grit sandpaper on a flat table and run the base plate over it a few times. High and low spots will quickly become apparent.) All in all, the 7310 is very underwhelming in its quality and precision. As far as the \"Rotozip\" style trimmers go, the DeWalt and Bosch models offer better quality and refinement then this PC, though they, too, suffer from some of the same problems.\nBy far the better alternative is the tried-and-true Porter Cable 310 production router. This model has long been a favorite of professional cabinetmakers (the guys in my shop own two or three each), but it is somewhat unknown to the woodworking public at large. It is not made for mass market consumers (Home Depot/Lowes don't carry it), and PC has instead promoted the 7310 trimmer as its mainstay trim router. The 7310 trimmer, however, is but a shadow of the 310. Read some of the reviews on the 310 and you'll see what I mean. The 310 is truly a fine machine. At $100, the 7310 is not a great value. At $159, the 310 is worth every penny. Spend more now and you'll be very satisfied with the knowledge that you own the very best. More importantly, your work will show the wisdom of your choice.\nSadly, Porter Cable no longer sells the excellent offset, angle, and other optional bases for the 310. If you need these you can acquire them used or new-old-stock, but they are getting harder to find. The premium prices of these trimmers and optional bases found on Ebay attest to the loyal following the 310 has. These bases are available for the 7310, but you will still have to deal with the inferior design and quality of that trimmer. Again, go with the DeWalt or Bosch if you need a complete trim kit with all the bases. If you don't need them, get the 310 and you'll be set for life.

Since it takes the standard 1/4\" bits, it makes it a convenient, multi use tool.\n If you do a lot of counter top, laminate work, their combo pack, with the different bases, is the top choice. Saves a lot of money over buying the individual bases.\n I looked at some overseas, and the Ryobi model, and decided to spring for the Porter Cable. The metal base, and fine adjust feature, and metal housing, set it apart. This is a professional level piece of equipment. Should give you many years of trouble free performance.\n When you are doing fine work, the lightness, and ease of visibility afforded by this router, is unmatched.\n If I had to be critical of it, I would say that when changing a bit, I remove the base, which isn't that hard, for easy access.

I'd originally bought a Porter-Cable and WE were very unhappy with it. I own SEVERAL Dewalt power tools, so I was confident in stepping up in price, knowing that the quality is commensurate.  It would have received 5 stars if it wasn't for the pressure foot issue listed below.\n\nPro's.\nBlade change is relatively easy. Two thumb screws, top and bottom secure the blade in place. Clearance to the lower thumbscrew is good but not superb. The upper arm pivots up so you can position your work piece for inside cuts without having to completely remove the blade. Simply loosen the top thumbscrew for the blad, lift the arm, set your work, lower the arm, tighten your blade and go for it.\n\nVibration is minimal, even at higher speeds. This is due, in no small part to the cast-iron work surface and the metal construction of the saw itself. All adjustments are easy and well thought out, except for what I listed below, Bevel markings on the gauge are easy to read and the table locks securely at all possible angles. Blade tension adjuster is easy to use and consistently accurate.  The extended handle makes tension adjustments very simple. The power switch is large and easy to get to.  The blower arm stays where you put it!.  It provides enough air to keep your work piece clear, allowing you to easily see your cutting area.\n\nThe unit is somewhat heavy, which in this case is a GOOD THING! It provides added stability and speaks to the general quality of the Dewalt line of products.\n\nThe \"it would be nice\" category:\nThe saw only uses plain blades. You cannot use pin blades in this unit.  While that isn't a problem for my wife, some of you might like to have that option. If you must use pin blades, you'll need a different saw.\n\nHaving the ability to lift the upper arm is a great benefit. It would be nice if it were engineered to stay in place by itself rather than requiring you to hold it while moving your work piece. Not a real issue, but it is a minor inconvenience.\n\nThe scroll saw doesn't generate a lot of sawdust so a dust collection attachment for a shopvac isn't a requirement. However, it 'would be nice' to have that option. I'm sure that some people like to keep their work area completely sawdust free, so for them it would be an added bonus.\n\nCon's\nI am disappointed in the pressure foot. While it is large enough, the design is flawed. When you lower the pressure foot on your work piece and tighten the thumb screw, it continues to lower the foot, increasing the pressure on the work piece, making it too tight to move it easily or accurately. If you lift it off a little and then tighten it, there in little to no pressure on the project, even though tightening it does continue to lower it.  Also, the foot is prone to lateral movement. In order to avoid this I have to tighten it so much that my wife can't loosen it and it makes it difficult for me as well. Not practical nor helpful\n\nI've review the light and stand separately.

A typical flashlight with an incondescant bulb will normally be WELL under 20 lumins, including the DeWalt flexible floodlight. At close objects it has a very small, bright center beam, but a very broad overspill beam allowing the user to view things not in the main beam very well. For illuminating distant objects, the small center beam gets broader with the distance from the object. It will illuminate objects 400-500 ft. away. I purchased the LED flashlight on Amazon and consider it to be one of the best flashlights I've owned. The way that LED flashlights have improved (compared to incondescant bulbs) is amazing. I use 3 re-chargeable AA batteries in mine. They get 3-5 hours per charge. In about 6 months I've only had to recharge it one time, and it gets lots of use.

I am not using a skill 77 any more, or even the Porter Cable 743.  In fact I switched from a left bladed worm to a right blader  just to get the toughness and power that this Milwaukee saw has.  The first  guy to review this saw (conceptbydesign) hit the nail on the head when he  said this saw was tough.  There are many well-designed features on this saw  but the best thing is the power and toughness.\n\nAnother great  feature is the fact that if you set this saw to a shallow cutting depth,  the handle stays where it belongs or where you want it to be - down near  the work -- instead of getting way up in the air where it's hard to  control.  Also, the blade guard handle is back off the shoe where it's  easy and safe to grab.  Setting a bevel on this saw is a dream.  The  markings are clear and the lock comes easy to the hand.  On some saws the  shoe is thin and \"bendy\" or too narrow.  This one is almost perfect.\n\nNow a circular saw is probably the second most personal tool a  carpenter will own right after a hammer.  I wouldn't be surprised if every  saw here on Amazon got five stars, because everyone likes something a  little different with their saws.  You have to decide which features are  right for you.  There are almost more opinions about which saw is better  than there are saws.  That's why I used a 77 for 30 years without changing.  But the first time I pulled the trigger on this saw it was clear that the  sheer power was going to make for accurate cuts and pleasant work.  This is  also one of the lightest saws there is - at least amongst the beefy framing  saws.  It was time for a change.  No saw is perfect - here are the gigs:  This saw is a bit noisy.  It has a good blade guard but it still would be  nice to have a blade brake.  Maybe someday Milwaukee will read this and  make one that has a left blade.

I built my own heavy duty wooden stand for it which works very well. It is made with 4x4s, 2x4s and 3/4 plywood top and 1/2 plywood bottom, all scraps from around the shop. Stand is very heavy to absorb vibrations from the saw.  I used 12 inch drawer slides left over from another project and bought good lockable wheels at Lowes.  You could probably land a helicopter on it but I am a retired engineer so I overbuild everything.  I didn't like the DeWalt stand, looks top heavy and unwieldy, too tall and narrow.  I am old and I like to sit if I can.\n\nI use it in front of a big gulp dust collection hood next to it with the blower blowing dust into the big gulp so I capture most of the dust except what is underneath which I get with my vacuum.  I am mostly concerned with dust that I would breath.  My air quality meter is usually in the single digits when it is running.  I have a large Oneida 3hp dust collector.\n\nIt only comes with two cheap blades so buy more and better.  I am a beginner scroller but I am getting better quickly with this machine.  I use a 4x4 block to hold up the arm when I change blades or do internals as you see in the pics.  Maybe the more expensive saw like Henger is better but for now this is good.  If I do a lot of scrolling then I could justify a Henger machine but I don't, I work for my enjoyment not for income.\n\nFor those who are beginners my best advice is get this saw and when you are learning use spiral blades and go slowly and stop when you start to go off line.  I find if I do a little and stop, relax, then do some more and repeat, I get better results.

Gardner", "reviewText": "I was conflicted about buying this fence until I finally found a review that mentioned my specific router. The answered questions are all over the map with some being quite wrong. So I'm writing this to hopefully clear up confusion for others.\n\nThis is a review of the DeWALT DW6913 Parallel Fence\n\nThe item arrived on time and packaged well.\n\nThe reason I bought this adjustable fence is to cut mortises on a home made jig. The router registers against a guide block using an attached fence mounted on the plunge base. Prior to, all fence adjustments were eyeball and unpredictable.\n\nOne must remember that this unit is specificly built for dewalt routers. Other routers will fit and possibly this review will help others understand if this will fit their router.\n\nThe instructions are very basic and only refer to installing the fence to the base. They do mention the rod sizes as 8mm and 10mm. The threads on the 8mm rods are for mounting the unit to a dewalt dw610 base. The rods do not screw together. The 10mm rods are just rods without other features. The 8mm rods measure 280mm plus the threads. The 10mm rods measure 380mm. The length of the rods could allow for some added capacity of fence depth.\n\nIn the box is the fence completely assembled, the two sets of rods, a dust reducer for small vac hoses and two extra wingnuts and springs.\n\nI did some measuring to understand the adjustment. It appears the threads are M6 with a convenient tpi of 1mm. So each turn of the dial moves the fence 1mm and each mark represents 0.1mm (just shy of 0.004\").\n\nThe total travel of the fence is limited to the locking slot in the aluminum bracket. This bracket mounts to the stamped sheet metal fence support at one position only. The total movement measures 15mm. There are some markings on the stamping both in mm and inches.\n\nThe rods mount in two different locations and so give two different spreads between centers. The positions are on either side of their respective locking wingnuts. It appears the spreads were designed in sae because they measure 3.25\" and 4.0\".\n\nThe dust collector can be removed. It appears it can only function if one were routing on edge. I guess it would give more control but would take much longer adjusting than just using a bit with a bearing.\n\nThe fence pads can be moved apart to accommodate edge routing.\n\nThe first pic show my jig setup. The second pic shows two 1/4\" end mill touch offs. The lower mark was purposely off center. I ruler measured it and found it to be a bit over 5/32\" off center so I moved the fence just over 4 turns (the way I calc'd it was 4.17 turns). I was pleasantly surprised to see it moved about 4.2mm and I hit the center line as close as I need it to be for making my mortises. One measurement, one adjustment is fantastic!\n\nI then move the dial one turn in the opposite direction without regard to backlash. The third pic shows this new touch off and the one that's on center. It's really hard to tell but I don't think backlash would be an issue at all. Having said that, it's always best to adjust in the same direction.\n\nAll-in-all, I think this fence will do just what I want it to. It fits my Makita RT0701C and, knowing how much the fence moves per dial rev, and more importantly, that it actually moves that much, making adjustments on will be much easier and more accurate.\n\nIf the rods and spreads are compatible with your base, I recommend this fence for you.", "summary": "one adjustment is fantastic!

It has done miles of laminate and counter-edge trimming of oak and other hardwoods, and after probably hundreds of hours of use it is still running as new.\n\nIs it perfect?  No.  The height adjustment is at best, primitive.  I've just learned how to set its depth-of-cut with minimum follow-up corrections.  The nut that is supposed to secure the base to the body needs to be tightened with pliers, since hand tightening is just not enough to prevent it from loosening and then moving during a cut.  My trimmer came with the full laminate-trimming kit in a nice steel carrying case, and back when laminate counter tops were still acceptable in kitchens, this kit was great.\n\nI routinely abuse this little machine by doing long 12 radius roundovers on long beams and such, and it has never overheated or shown any signs of stress. I like the fact that it has a shaft-lock so that only one wrench is required to change bits.  The button is not very well placed, however, and I seem to hit it occasionally during use.  No damage has resulted, but it makes a lot of noise and is no doubt not good for the tool.

Well, there's not much to learn at all. I have used several other less expensive saws in my time, but WOW is this worth the price!\n\nThe tension knob has numbers on it so you can get the tension the same each time with each different blade. No guessing where to turn a knob.\n\nThe blades ARE very easy to put in!  Blade changing has always been a pain with other saws so I don't know why this is so easy. I barely tighten the knob (wimpy girl) (no wrench needed) and the blade is in. Maybe there is something inside the blade holder that is different and holds blades in place better than the others without the excessive tightening.\n\nThe blower actually works and having a long, bendable arm, you can position it where you want.\n\nThe lower blade guard was in the way so I took it off. I always turn off the power strip when I change blades so I feel safe doing this although it is certainly \"not recommended\".\n\nThe upper arm can be raised to make it easier to insert the top part of the blade into your project for inside cuts. I cut a piece of wood to hold the arm  up when I do this. Yes, Dewalt has been informed of this oversight and may put something on the arm next time to hold it up.\n\nThe best accessory for this? That foot pedal. No more trying to hold my wood with one hand while the blade is going, and reach up or down to turn the machine off ! When I need a break, the phone rings, or a neighbor drops by, I take my foot off the pedal and it comes to a \"dead stop\" just as advertised. Great one on Amazon for about $22.  Magnifying light is terrific to have too.\n\nMost scroll saw web sites tell newbees not to use the spiral blades and I don't know why. I am not a newbee, but I'm not a professional either. I make basic craft things, and do not make the intricate fret work. The \"New Spiral Blades\" by Flying Dutchman, (# 5's)  go through my pine wood like butter and there is no need to  keep turning the wood either. I am not real good at making small turns with the regular blades.  With a blade that's twisted and can go in any direction, I have no trouble getting into tight areas. These blades have flat ends too, which make them real easy to install. (This saw takes only flat ended blades, no pin blades)\n\n Amazon...please look into carrying these Flying Dutchman \"New Spiral Blades\" soon so we don't have to search for them!\n\nLastly, this machine runs so quietly, compared to the others, you hardly know it's on.\n\nAs you can tell, I am so very jazzed that I finally got this Dewalt.", "summary": "Best birthday present I ever bought for myself !!!

Ross", "reviewText": "I'm an experienced craftsman, but not a finish woodworker, so when I needed to significantly modify my favorite Oak TV cabinet in our living room to make it fit a new wide-screen TV, I had to temporarily enter into the world of routers and router bits. I had several jobs to do including rounding a four-foot portion of the cabinet edge with a 3/8\" roundover bit.  This edge has a molding sticking up just 1 1/4\" inches away so only a router with a narrow base could do the job. Another constraint was that my 3/8\" roundover bit is 1.26\" in diameter.  Since I had a one-time application for a router (my other router is used as a tool-post grinder on a metal lathe) I opted for the good reviews and inexpensive price of the PC 7310 and an inexpensive set of bits&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Yukon-Tool-YTRB24-24-Piece-Router-Bit-Set/dp/B00006F702/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Yukon Tool YTRB24 24-Piece Router Bit Set</a>.\n\nMy experience?...Very satisfied...but I did some customization.\nFirst, the router worked great with very smooth and powerful operation in all the tasks that I used it for...which may be beyond what it is supposed to be used for.  I was very careful, given my inexperience with routers, and built up temporary support structures and guide fences for most of my uses which included: round a four-foot portion of a solid oak cabinet edge with a 3/8\" roundover bit, flush trim 3/4\" oak plywood with a flushtrim bit, mortis out an exposed plywood edge with a mortising bit, cut out mounting holes for cooling fans using a cooling-fan template and a flushtrim bit, cut off the edge of a 3/4\" solid oak cabinet door and remold it with an ogee bit combined with two other bits, and chamfer the edge of a new 1/4\" Masonite cabinet partition.\n\nThough the router worked great, I had two problems: 1) its base was still too wide to ride on the narrow edge of my cabinet and allow the 3/8\" roundover bit to do its job, and 2) the cutter hole in the bottom of the base of the PC 7310 is too small (1.204\" diameter) to allow installation of my 1.260\" diameter 3/8\" roundover bit. Also, the plastic base provided by PC is not particularly flat, as noted by other reviewers, but that was not critical for my application.  Since the router baseplate is relatively easy to unscrew, I solved all of these issues by fabricating a new aluminum baseplate for the router with a narrow width on one side as needed for my application, and a larger hole as required for my larger cutters...and I made this baseplate flat.\n\nMinor inconveniences: The cutters are a bit difficult to remove after they're tightened, but my Yukon cutters all had a ridge near the shaft so that a screwdriver could be used with a twist to break them free.  Also, I invariably chose to remove the entire base to install and remove the cutters, but that took only seconds.\n\nBottom Line: the router did a great job for me and was amply powerful to not visibly labor on my significant tasks with oak cabinetry.  My custom modifications solved my particular problems, but these are probably unneeded for the vast majority of the router's intended use.

After I purchased a home of my own, and being a bit of a DIY'r, I invested in a miter saw, table saw and Ryobi cordless circular saw, none of which I came to find were very good for cutting thick (4x4) or wet treated lumber, especially the Ryobi cordless saw which severly lacked power.  I received a Milwaukee 6390-21 circular saw as a gift.  I fell in love with it the first time I used it.  While I consider it a 'beast' due to its power and ability to slice through lumber like a hot knife through butter, I was surpised at how accurate and precise the cuts were.  Being a right handed saw, I was concerned about visability, but it's not an issue because you can clearly see the blade from both sides of the saw. The saw has a number of adjustments, all of which can be made quickly and easily, without tools. I agree with other reviewers that the included blade isn't of high quality, so you'll most likely want to purchase a better one. The hard case is larger than it needs to be, and is impossible to close if the saw isn't properly seated.  The case could also benefit from a place to store accessories, such as a rip guide (not included with the saw). Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this saw and highly recommend it.

I've made shelving and cabinets using pine, cedar and oak. I've cut 2 by's for deck construction and ripped plywood for roof repair.  This saw is terrific.  It is powerful, solid without being excessively heavy, and very well balanced for a sidewinder.  Calibration marks are clear and accurate for depth of cut and baseplate angle.  Large adjustment lever and knob make these adjustments easy.  I've done a number of jobs requiring 45 degree bevel cuts.  If you've done this, you know how difficult it can be using a handheld curcular saw.  Well, I'm impressed with how accurate the gauge is and how easy it is to balance this saw to get perfect mitered corners.  The most remarkable feature is the Tilt-Lok.  I wasn't sure how often I would use this when I first considered buying this model, but I find I use it often and really like it.  It allows me to get just the right handle angle so that whether I'm making cuts on the ground, or kneeling on a roof, cutting above my head or using saw horses, I can find an angle where the handle and trigger feel just right and I'm in control.  Even without electronic braking, the wind-down interval is very brief.  The self storing wrench and spindle lock button eliminate a lot of fumbling during blade changes.  A few points to consider:  the blade that ships with this saw is for ripping, so plan on buying a couple more for cross cuts and fine finishing.  Also, you'll need a rip fence because Milwaukee doesn't include this vital accessory:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Milwaukee-Rip-Fence-Kit-Model-49-22-4146/dp/B000022473/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Milwaukee Rip Fence Kit, Model# 49-22-4146</a>.  Finally, the base plate is aluminum to keep the weight down, but the aluminum galls on some surfaces and leaves marks, so plan on putting some tape on the bottom to protect fine work pieces.  Every time I start a new job, I look forward to opening that big red box and taking out this really fine instrument.", "summary": "A cutting edge saw", "unixReviewTime": 1323475200}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "23", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "09 6, 2001", "reviewerID": "A3B2ARLN9FZ3XZ", "asin": "B00002231G", "reviewerName": "Derek J Visocky", "reviewText": "This is a very nice, high-quality extension.

The screws to secure it are self-tapping, which is explained in the instructions, so be prepared for that.  I use it with the DW703.  The only reason that I didn't rate it 5 stars is that if you want support on both sides, you need to purchase 2 of the DW7080's.

When it came time to install my dado blade, there was the factory splitter. Aggravating to remove and more aggravating to install and align.

Much more in many ways than the cost of this splitter/ kickback device.  DO NOT order the wrong unit.  Right tilt and left tilt saws require their own order number.\n\nInstallation was non-complex, bigger hands than mine might have some grief but that goes without saying when working in tight spaces.  All of the original blade guard hardware must be removed. If you already installed and auxiliary out feed table, you may have to loosen a bolt or two and readjust it when you're done. No big deal.\n\nKeep in mind that the splitter/kickback device is removable and replaceable in seconds; also keep in mind that this splitter is for 1/8\" blades only.  Thin kerf blades will not work with this unit. A three horsepower and higher saw does not require a thin kerf blade. They are meant for lower horsepower contractor and bench saws since the thin kerf allows for easier cutting pressures.\n\nSome of the earlier Biesemeyer overhead blade guards came with a removable splitter that sold separately for about $30.00.  The 78-431 is about $130.00 and more meaty than the thirty dollar freebee.\n\nI use this splitter/kickback device faithfully and never had a problem.  Here's to all my fingers!!

Appears to be about 1/16 per graduation - but it's so coarse, I wouldn't trust it.  Plan on making test cuts to verify your settings.\n\nThe fine adjustment dial (which was the main reason I bought this fence) is a bit of a joke.  There is a graduated ring (0..9) but no way to lock the ring to the knob - bump it once during series of a \"precision cuts\" and you can kiss your zero point goodbye.  Maybe if it was a bit more of a friction fit... but mines pretty easy to move.  3 options 1) Live with it and be careful not to bump it.  2) tape the knob down once you decide where \"zero\" should be.  3) superglue.\n\nSpeaking of the graduations on the adjustment dial - there's no tick-mark to line it up to (at least I don't see one).  Options - 1) pick a spot to use as your zero point 2) make a mark with a paint pen 3) use a small file to make a small notch.\n\nThe fine adjustment dial itself - there's ZERO documentation on how much it moves the fence per turn.  Just a bit of fiddling around it LOOKS LIKE 1 full turn is about 1/16. The operative word is \"ABOUT\" - it's not 1/16.  I'm not even certain it's repeatable. So if you back off 2 turns, then try to get back to a previous settng by going forward 2 turns... the backlash in the screw will probably throw you off a good bit (I haven't tested this yet).\n\nAll the lock down knobs seem to introduce a bit of flex when you crank them down - yet another negative impact on accuracy.  You could \"dial out\" that inaccuracy if the fine adjustment were better engineered.\n\nLocking knobs / for the rails do seem to clamp down pretty securely with little to no slop in the fence once they are locked.  Reminds me of the way the wingnuts lock the fence on an old Stanley 45 plane - it was good enough 100 years ago...\n\nLocking knob for the \"fine adjust\" <cough>  You need to be certain that you lock this down (all the knobs \"bottom out\" with a fairly positive feel - so you'll know when you are locked) If you forget this critical step, the fence alignment will move around during the cut.  DAMHIKT.\n\nVacuum attachment - can't say too much about it - I'm making 1.5\" deep dado's about 5 inches in from the edge - the vacuum port doesn't help much in that scenario.\n\nInstructions:  There aren't any.  Just one page of legal CYA.\n\nPackaging - it's a pretty big box for just the fence and a couple rods.  Waste of cardboard (aka dead tree).\n\nOverall verdict:  If you were looking for a real \"high accuracy\" edge guide with dead-nuts 1/64 precision right out of the box - this ain't it.  If you mess around with it, you can probably work out the calibration for the fine adjustment down to 1/32 or so.  And if you are careful, plan your work and allow for test cuts to verify each change in settings - it can give you fairly accurate, straight cuts.\n\nDewalt could/should have done better.  They are part of the same conglomerate that owns Porter-Cable (and Delta, and Black & Decker).  The PC edge guide is the same price - but a much more robust and accurate design.  Too bad the PC guide won't fit the Dewalt routers (at least, not without some serious modification)\n\nOne tip - run the guide on the WASTE SIDE of your cut if possible, so any slips don't ruin the piece.  If you need dead-nuts accuracy (ie. you don't have a \"waste side\", then you need to be very careful.

After considerable use, here's my assessment.\nPositive observations:\n- It's build like a tank and will probably run forever.\n- It's well-balanced and offers smooth sanding capabilities\nNegative observations:\n- The metal baseplate or \"shoe\" that came with the unit started warping after 1-2 hours of hard use, due to excessive heat.  Fortunately, I had taken the advice of another reviewer and purchased the graphite impregnated shoe and was able to replace the original shoe without losing time on the job.\n- At 12.0 amps, it's still significanly underpowered.  It almost stalls with a 50 grit belt and heavy pressure.\n- It's dust collection capabilities are mediocre, at best.  Even when connected to a large shop vac, it clogs continuously during heavy sanding.  Repeated clearing with an air hose is necessary.\n- The machining on the housing is poor, especially in the area around the dust collection opening near the back of the belt.  The mating surfaces don't align, which adds to the dust collection problems since the dust collects in the misaligned joint.  I was able to improve this some with a small file but access is limited unless you remove the rear roller.\n- The label on this machine says \"Whisper Seriers\".  I don't know what Porter Cable's definition of \"whisper\" is, but it's obviously much different than mine.  Ear plugs are absolutely essential for the operator and anyone else within \"whisper\" distance.\nOverall, I would have to say that there are better choices than this sander.

This is practically useless since I don't always want 20\" sticking out the side of the saw.  Others noted the same issue with their model saws.  If it stowed it would be perfect, but it doesn't and I'm dissapointed.  Also, the screws are self tapping which explains some issues other people described in their reviews.

This is one powerful, tough, saw. As a remodeling contractor I am very hard on tools and this saw can take the abuse.  I have owned several other circular saws and this is easily my favorite.  I also have the Porter Cable blade on left which I have used the last 3 years. I like the Porter Cable and I love the visibility of the blade on left, but it always feels out of balance in my hand since I am right-handed, and when setting up cuts you often find that the majority of the saw's shoe and weight is being supported by the off cut side, because the blade on left is meant for left handers.\n\nThe Milwaukee 6390 has solved this problem.  It is extremely well balanced and the design of the blade opening in the shoe allows for excellent visibility of the cut line from above the saw. As a right hander you do not need to lean over the saw to see your cut line. Some guys are in such a habit of doing just that, and it is a hard habit to break.  I have pointed out to them how you can easily see the cut line from above and they always comment on how great that is.\n\nThe bevel adjustment handle is large and sturdy and easy to adjust.  Bevel cuts on this saw are the best I have ever experienced.  It will cut bevels up to 51 degrees or so like butter.  No bogging or binding whatsoever.\n\nTwo minor complaints that Milwaukee should address is that the shoe has a little bump on the edge at each corner, so that if you are using a straight edge like a speed square as a cutting guide, those little bumps will cause you to not get a perfectly square cut. To solve this I just filed them off. The other thing is that I did not like the thin kerf blade that came with the saw.  I put on a heavy duty carbide framing blade and the saw cuts much smoother, and quieter.  I get perfectly square cuts now, and this thing will go through a stud so smoothly it feels like 1 X .\n\nDespite its minor flaws the Milwaukee is still deserving of 5 stars especially when you start comparing other saws.

Petersen", "reviewText": "I just started using this saw (I purchased the lefthand 6391) to complement my lefthand Skil 5510 5-1/2\" Circular Saw. My old (20 years) 7-1/4\" Skil saw was overdue for replacement. Even though I use my 5-1/2 for most of my cutting, I need a 7-1/4 now and then for heavier work like cutting 4x stock. Here are my impressions of the Milwaukee 6391.\nGood -\n1-Surprising light weight for a 7-1/4. The magnesium\\aluminum\\plastic housing makes this unit the lightest 7.25s I have handled. And I checked all the major brands at home depot, hefting each in turn.\n2- First class construction. Every component of this machine is precision. The aircraft aluminum shoe is a marvel to behold. Much better then the stamped steel some others use. The depth of cut release mechanism is the best I have seen. Big grabbable handle that smoothly releases the shoe. Ditto on the bevel release, both easy on the fingers and they lock down with confidence. I really like the grab handle at the front of the saw. Its grippy-rubber covered and fits the hand perfectly. The magnesium housing around the top of the blade looks cool and give this saw an impressive look. The adjustable handle is a clear break-through in saw design. Its a brilliant innovation and I'm surprised no other manufacturer thought of this before. It lets you set the angle your hand engages the tool with. So whether you are working material below your knees or even overhead, you have eight settings to chose from. I'm still experimenting with the settings, but with this saw, you have a choice. I really like the rubberized handle too. No more slipping out of a sweaty palm.\n3- Power. I'm working with salvaged fir timbers this month, all 4x and this old wood is hard and tough. The 6391 just powers through without slowing at all! Even the full 4\"x12\" beams are no match for the powerful motor on the machine. I have to flip the timbers to cut all the way through them and the resulting cuts are square and smooth, and I'm doing these free hand, without a 90 degree helper-square. The blade that came with the saw is good, a 16 point carbide tipped one. When it starts to dull I'll switch over to a Freud TK203 7-1/4\" 24-Tooth Thin Kerf.\n4- Case. The saw comes with a LARGE red carry case. It will hold extra extension cords and other pliable items if desired.\nNegative - Very little here.\n1- The depth of cut guage is set on the inside of the saw housing and its hard to see. The marking are in 1/4\" increments, which is how much blade you want pertruding from below the work surface but the numbers are not easy to read. The Ryobi 7.25 had a very good depth guage setup, the best of all the ones I looked at at HD.\n2- No blade brake. Some of the high end saws have this feature, I'm not sure why Milwaukee left this out. Maybe to save on weight. It would be a \"nice to have.\"\n2a- An update on the blade brake feature.  The \"right hand\" model, the 6394, has the blade brake.  I found this out from the Milwaukee web site.  No plans to offer this feature in the \"lefty\" model though (I wrote them).  You do lose a 1/4 horse of power on the 6394; maybe thats the trade off.  I'd rather have the power to be honest.\nThis is a great circular saw. If you use one of these tools on a regular basis, or if you are just a now-and-then user but like to have the best tools, get this one.

Had it not been for that I don't think I would have paid the $500.00 or so that they are asking retail. This saw operates smoothly enough and the blades are easy to change and tension, all the controls being right there on the top arm. I haven't had any issues with the speed control so far as some have had. The table top, as many have complained, is somewhat roughly milled, making it more difficult to rotate pieces while your scroll cutting. Fortunately, I have an 18\" wide belt sander which I ran the top through with 120 and 220 grit to make it smooth. That along with some paste wax and she's perfect. The table top is not parallel to the surface of my work bench. It's about 5/8\" or so inch higher on one side, after adjusting the top square to the blade, which others have complained causes the blade to hit the inside of the throat opening. Mine wasn't far enough off to cause that , although it's far enough off level to make the tilt gauge pointer ineffective, which I don't really see as a problem since I'll probably never be tilting the table and if I do I would never rely on the accuracy of it anyway with out checking the angles with a tilt gauge and making test cuts. For the kind of money that they want retail for one of these, one shouldn't have to deal with any of the quality issues that are present. So far, for me this has been a good value since I don't use a scroll saw much and I didn't want to spend the the hundreds and hundreds more for an Excaliber, Hegner, Rbi hawk, etc. , but didn't want a $75.00 to $175.00 Taiwanese one either.

I don't really want the scroll saw to move unless I am trying to work with another tool in my smaller shop.  A heavier duty grade or thickness of metal may or may not be a psychological thing.\n* Speaking of moving the scroll saw, for those of us with a limited amount of space, and moving tools around as you go from project to project or the various stages projects go from inception to completion, it would be nice if you could put casters on the bottom of the thing without having to drill your own holes into the metal.  That's not a contradiction to my first bullet point above as I would put on locking casters to keep it stationary.\n* The stand is put together with  inch bolts, and assembly in the upper rear part of the stand is about as tight as it gets - be prepared to pull out your wrenches as a normal-size socket set interferes with other portions of the assembly.

The alignment mechanism can rotate about 10 degrees in either direction along the stamped steel fence (not intentionally, either, it just sucks and is imprecise) and there is a lot of slop in the whole design.\n\nOne of the worst attributes of this guy is that because it's so loose and sloppy, you can't get repeatable measurements - even if you align a clamp on a workpiece and then expect the fence to act as a \"stop\", the distance from the router bit to each end of the fence can shift slightly as you use the tool, so your results end up being slightly off at all times. Really pretty horrible, considering that routers are precision tools.\n\nThe only reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that the steel rods were fairly straight.

It worked great for about 11 months, so I thought I was one of the lucky ones, and then it started making a horrible banging noise. I took it to the shop, waited 3 weeks to get it back (3 weeks during my BUSIEST SEASON), and less than a month after I got it back, it died on me completely. I took it back to the shop, waited another 3 weeks to get it mailed back to me (since the shop is 40 miles away), and it was physically broken when I got it back. I sent it back to them, and they got the factory to send me a new saw. Horray! It worked like a dream for about a week, and then it started making an awful knocking noise and vibration. I had just about had it by now, so I just kept running it for the next month since it still actually cut, and finally today it quit on me.\n\n$500 is A LOT of money to me. I've had a Ryobi scroll saw that I got for $30 at a yard sale, almost 4 years ago now, that I have never had a single problem with. It's really too small and the blade changes were too annoying, and that's why I shelled out all the money for a dewalt. Now I wish I had just saved up longer and bought a higher quality saw, but even then, who knows what the quality of that would be. I'm so disappointed with this saw, it makes me sick.\n\nIf it worked consistantly, it would be a great saw, but it doesn't.", "summary": "Good Saw, but Don't Waste your money", "unixReviewTime": 1363305600}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "6", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2013", "reviewerID": "A19GSC3QMK694Q", "asin": "B000022313", "reviewerName": "COLORADO HERMIT", "reviewText": "In the last 3 months I've tried 4 different scroll saws, 5 counting this one. All the others were ridiculously difficult to install and change blades. And they all had big holes in the table with a plastic insert with big slots in them making it difficult to make square edged cuts and cutting out small parts. I don't know why they put all those plastic guards around the lower arm.\nNow this one is so easy to use compared to the others. The blade clamps are made for plain end blades and its no problem to clamp even one of the smallest sized blades.\n As for doing inside cuts, no problem. One of the other saws I tried had this big clear plastic guard thing over the end of the upper arm and blade clamp. There was no way to get a blade up through a work piece to do inside cuts. With the Dewalt all I have to do is loosen the clamp off of the blade and I can raise the arm a couple inches leaving plenty of room to line a work piece up with the blade then lower the arm and clamp the blade in place. The only thing needed is a small block to hold the arm up while getting the blade through the work piece.\n The blade tension adjustment is also way better than on the other saws I've tried out. It's a little lever right there on the end of the upper arm and you only have to move it about a quarter of a turn to release the tension. Best of all it has markings to line it up with and I can feel it sliding over little notches as I turn it so when I find a tension that works good on a blade I can get the same tension every time I re-clamp the blade when moving it to another inside cut. The main thing you have to remember is you cant lift and carry the saw by the upper arm.\nThe speed adjustment is easy to use and the saw responds well and keeps a smooth action through its whole speed range. The on/off switch is big and easy to use right on top. One saw I tried it was down under the table another had it half way back on the side of the arm.\nAbout the only complaint I have about it is for the price, it should come with a work light. Even the cheapest poorest quality saw I've tried had a light on it. Almost $500 for it and they want another $30 Bucks for a work light. And it would be nice if they threw in the stand for it too for that price. Its a sweet machine but I think they want a little too much just for their name.

I inserted the same 1.25\" fostner bit and was amazed at how much torque this drill had. The Craftsman was struggling to drill a hole in 2 mins whereas this guy was blowing through a hole in 30 seconds or less.\n\nI'm very happy with this purchase!", "summary": "Excellent drill, huge amount of torque in a small form factor.", "unixReviewTime": 1491004800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2017", "reviewerID": "ASMBQCV12QDJL", "asin": "B00002233E", "reviewerName": "chillos s smith sr", "reviewText": "Great unit great price.", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1489276800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2017", "reviewerID": "APFXJN7G3C09A", "asin": "B00002233E", "reviewerName": "Jojobone", "reviewText": "Nothing not to like about this product.
