Will update again once I give it another shot, but for now, lowered from 4 stars to 2.\n\n----\nOriginal Review:\n\nThis is a pretty good case with an extended battery for the Galaxy S5 phone. This case replaces the back cover of your phone, and replaces the original battery with a larger one. At first it seemed to be off and not working as far as the percentage indicator goes, but after several days of use, it was clear that the battery was definitely lasting a lot longer. I can pretty much go double the time that I used to with the original battery, and on power save mode, even longer (even though the remaining battery life estimate may not be accurate).\n\nMy only complaint is that the case part of the item doesn't provide much protection to the screen. If would be nice if it had a bigger lip over the edge of the phone.  Size-wise it is not too much bigger than the original phone (considering that the battery is double) and I think it actually makes it easier to hold the phone.", "summary": "Good Extended Battery Case for the Samsung Galaxy S5", "unixReviewTime": 1465171200}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "12", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2016", "reviewerID": "AVOOU49YPVHGN", "asin": "9707716371", "reviewerName": "VVBulldog", "reviewText": "This is a review of a few items I just bought. As they are all related and being used together Im going to paste the same review to each product.\n\nRecently my Samsung S5 has been draining badly as the OEM battery started to come to the end of its life. I started looking around for a replacement and decided to get an extended battery. I have been using a wireless charging pad and I wanted to continue to charge with this method as I have several pads and even a wireless charger for my truck. The charging receiver I have been using was not going to work with the extended battery so I opted for one that plugs into the bottom charge port of the phone. Im not crazy about removing the door from the bottom of the phone but I cant seem to find a way to get everything I want no matter how many products I buy.\n\nWhat I settled on was the PowerBear 7800 battery and the wireless receiver listed in the link below, unless this review is the one for that receiver. I got and installed the Powerbear battery and two back covers. I first installed the wireless receiver and then popped on the hard plastic back plate. I then tested to see if the phone would charge on my pad. It did, on two separate brands of pads without issue. I then added the protective soft rubber back cover and tested the phone on the pads again. To my surprise it started to charge with both cases on it.\n\nThe battery and case backs feel of high quality and I really like not only how the two back plates look but feel. The extended battery and both plates do not add that much weight to the phone and the cases do not make the phone very fat. I have been using a LifeProof case up until this point so Im used to a larger phone. This case gives me plenty to hold on to with my man hands and still can be stowed in a pocket with ease.\n\nTo make up for the lose of my Lifeproof case I also purchased a set of the Moko waterproof cases. They were really cheap and seem to be made well enough for my use. I wanted something that I could use on my boat and motorcycle. These fit the bill and the phone with both back plates fit in the case easily. I find that once you place your phone in the bag you can press the air out to get a vacuum seal. This makes using the phone much easier. This is also the same company that I bough 2 wireless charging phone holders for my vehicles. They work very well and are much better than constantly dealing with a charging cord.\n\nI have not had the battery long enough to speak to its power and life. If it fails me or does not deliver the powder advertised I will be sure to update that review.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Rerii-Universal-Wireless-Charging-Micro-usb/dp/B00YGV76LK?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/PowerBear-Samsung-7800mAh-Extended-Protective/dp/9707716371?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Universal-Waterproof-MoKo-Armband-Devices/dp/B01AJP3F7A?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00\n\nUpdate: 11-5-16\nI recently took a trip where I had a almost 3 hour plane ride. I was watching movies the entire flight and before while waiting to board. I had the screen on full. I didn't have to worry about my battery at all. It lasted all day and I still had plenty of juice when I was ready to settle in the hotel room.\n\nI have also been able to use my phone while the screen is on full while listening to Pandora and using GPS on my motorcycle. I have not even come close to running the battery down yet.\n\nWhen I get up in the morning I don't even have to think about a charger and I do whatever I want on my phone without any worries. On a typical day of use I will end the day with still about 70%. On a heavy day after watching a movie and having the screen on full I might be in the 30%s. I have to really try to get in much lower than that in a day.\n\nIt was a great by and a great battery for travel.", "summary": "Great set of products.", "unixReviewTime": 1464652800}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2016", "reviewerID": "A1UJX32RPA5KHA", "asin": "9707716371", "reviewerName": "Maryalice Koch", "reviewText": "It was good except for making my phone hot.

My s5 wouldn't get through a whole day of phone calls, Pandora, email, Facebook, and maybe a little Hulu streaming.  With ANY extended battery I have owned I can do all these things and still have 30% or more battery life at the end of the day.  Sometimes even go for 2 days!  Now if I don't do all those things and I'm in a good service area then the battery will last 3 days.  If you really don't notice any improvement over your OEM battery then either you got a lemon or something else is going on.  Wouldn't be surprised if the Zero lemon guys are leaving bad reviews because Powerbear's 2 year warranty is far beyond their 180 days.  Honestly Zero lemon feels like a cheap knockoff compared to my experience with the powerbear so far.\nUpdate:  after using this for a month I can say it is not as long lasting as advertised.

I live where I do not have great service, it isn't that terrible but it's closer to an average 2 to maybe 3 bars typically and with that battery it would fight between 1 and 2 bars, and if it got covered by almost anything be it in my pocket or under a blanket, it (c/w)ould lose service altogether.  This battery doesn't seem to be giving me the same issues, so I am very happy with its performance so far.

The Nokia 3650 will browse the Web, and the battery is fairly long-lived.  On those counts, this is a perfectly acceptable upgrade.  However, when you rate it on its own merits, there are some points to consider.\nOne, it uses MMC flash for storage.  MMC isn't exactly the most popular format -- Secure Digital (SD) would have been a far better choice -- and so comparable capacities cost more for MMC than SD flash.  What I find disappointing about the MMC choice is that offering MMC *and* SD isn't very difficult in itself.  In fact, Lexar sells the Trio which handles Sony Memory Sticks, SD, and MMC quite nicely and compactly.  Minor point, perhaps, but consider your current flash memory investments before buying the phone.\nI love the camera.  Good snapshots, neat little movies that pick up sound, and even a sound recorder.  So the added utility of the phone is very attractive, making the flash memory issue a little more than minor (imagine owning five SD cards and realizing none of them work in this phone).\nThe Symbian OS is a dog.  It's a slow dog, that annoys me to no end.  The bootup time for this is comparable to Windows 3.1.  Really!  A PocketPC or Palm device, by comparison, has no boot time (well, the Palm OS has no boot time, PocketPC negligible for warm boot).  I'm not a big fan of this OS, or its abilities.\nNav of settings, utilities, etc. is a little complex.  There's a handful of ways to get at phone settings, for example, and there's probably a million little shortcuts you can use... and would probably not want to memorize.  Programmable front buttons let you choose oft-used apps (Camera and Bluetooth, for example) and it supports one-touch dialing... well, one-key plus the green \"ON-Go-Dial\" circle.\nSIM card support; store numbers on your SIM or the MMC card or the phone memory.  Seasoned travelers would likely store numbers on the SIM.  Onto Bluetooth and synchronizing.\nNokia's PC Suite is powerful, if you can get it to work.  Setting up your PC to use a Bluetooth stack isn't trivial (lookup Jon's \"Definitive Blueeooth Guide\" for the best help; also geekzone.co.nz).  When it does work, it's wonderful.  Pull off images, upload WAVs to use as ringtones, save all settings for backup, synchronize Outlook contacts and calendar to the phone, superb utility if you get it to go.\nAll this leads me to a solid conclusion: the Treo 600 kicks its butt.  PalmOS, SD card support, most mature synchronization utility available.  Aside from the cool camera functionality, this phone is not the best you can buy, leading me to believe that the true future of mid- and high-end phones, as well as PDAs of the same class, to be full convergence of the two.  And so with that in mind, get this phone if it's free with a new contract... then wait for smartphone prices to drop.\nFred", "summary": "It's almost smart... but flawed, and annoyingly so.", "unixReviewTime": 1086393600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "3", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2004", "reviewerID": "ALGZ9RAL5ZCTW", "asin": "B00009J5VV", "style": {"Format:": " Wireless Phone Accessory"}, "reviewerName": "Broo2", "reviewText": "I bought this phone a few days ago, and it is awesome!\nOut of the box, it is pretty cool(...)!\nCool Features: Bluetooth, MMC Card [16MB included- but upgradable], large screen, plays any MIDI you can drop into it, IR connectivity.\nTONs of software: It runs Symbian OS, so there are lots of programs/games to install.

I noticed that with my new Boost Mobile android phone without it the reception was good but with it the service was great. I have purchased several for family and friends over the years and they enjoy the clear reception too. It is important that you handle the antenna with care; put the booster in your phone with clean hands; and must be careful in placing it in the correct location as instructed to get the  best reception. It works best if you don't touch the antenna with your fingers, Hold it by the sides or edge; smooth it with a smooth flat card. I use my small library tag. If you put the antenna  into your phone incorrectly it will not work. I like to keep one on hand for a back-up to make changes after about six or seven months of use.  It also makes a nice gift to put into cards for that extra special touch.  The booster is a must have for less expensive phones and a big help for my android phone.

I was impressed at how it looks and feels better than the usual junk you'll find here that is imported.\n\nA negative seemed to be that the watch band is long - really long. It's longer than the stock leather band. But it turned out that the buckle is a bit on the side and the end strap can be \"bolted\" into place on the other side.

I have average sized mens wrists.\n\nPro - the new system of opening the pin latch and inserting the band is awesome. Took me 2 minutes to replace the band and done.\n\nCon - This one is unfortunate. Look at the band. The black watch can be classic. Look at the Moto version with its own black metal band. Looks very elegant - surprisingly so. The stock leather band also has completely black buckles and straps holders. Blends in without being obtrusive. Unfortunately Tylt didn't see fit to cover the very shiny silver buckle and end bolt the same black color. As a result, what looks like a very sharp and somewhat sporty silicon band looks more like the stock plastic bands you'll find on digital watches like Casio, Timex, etc. And since the buckle is so high up, don't expect to put a classy watch face on the top and have it be mistaken for anything else with the silver buckles present.

Also, you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures.\n\n3)You can download games with the E715 whereas you cannot do so with the v205.

Also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved, and you look at it, it's in full color so no worries there.\n\nOverall, I have enjoyed this phone and no problems with it really.

It MAY last 2 to 3 days in stand by IF I don't use it at all; if I use the phone at all, even just 10 minutes, no more than one day on a full charge. 2. No voice activated dialing. I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial. I think all phones should have it. 3. It is not very user friendly. The menus are not logical and are confusing. 4. It has an IR but it doesn't sync with your computer. You can't transfer anything. I don't get why they even have it. They have software and cable you can purchase that will let you backup the phone numbers you enter and photos you take, but (5) no syncing with Outlook, your PDA or anything else. 6. If you buy ring tones or wallpaper, you can't back those up.\nI do love the phone for its size, weight and even the color, I find it easy to hold and talk with. The sound isn't the best, but it isn't bad either. It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy. I can't put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it's a long key, the holder makes the camera come on. I had to get a small holder that only grabs in one small area on each side. I've had to purchased 3 additional batteries and every kind of charger available because the average use of a battery is 15 hours (regular phone use for me is: about 10 minutes a day, use the \"t-zones\" for a minute or two once a month, in 6 months I've taken a total of 9 photos, and transferred data twice). The battery lasted 3 days ONCE, when I was home sick and didn't use the phone and one 24 hour day I had to replace the battery three times as they completely discharged. I'm use to a battery lasting 5 to 8 days (like this phone says it will last).\nI also like T-Mobile. Their customer service is really good, the features they offer on their web site are great, the prices for wireless modem and wireless web are incredibility great and the national calling price plans are very good compared to what I?ve seen elsewhere.

Most of their functionalities are the similar while some have the extra bonus bells and whistles while really sells the product.  Like many others, I was attracted to this phone because of the nice styling, the size, and the camera.  I have previously owned a Samsung S105, which was a nice phone as well so it was easy for me to learn this phone since many menu functions were similar.\nThe first and foremost thing I look for in a phone is the sound quality.  The sound quality of the phone is not bad.  Having owned the Nokia 6610 as well I would say the Nokia phone sounds a little better but this might be because I am used to the 6610.  I am sure most people will be happy with the sound quality of the E715.\nThe next thing is reception.  Unlike the older Samsung phones this phone uses an internal antenna which works good, if not better than phones with antennas.\nThe camera on this phone is quite nice.  There is a flash and a zoom feature which is added bonus.  The 640x480 pictures taken by this phone is OK to be viewed by cell phones' smaller screens but if you view the pictures on your computer you might be disappointed.\nThis phone does have a 40 chord Midi capability which means you can download some good songs.  For the tech savvy there is a program called Easy GPRS which can be downloaded from Samsung's European website. This program will allow you sync up your phone with your pc.  The other program which I like is called PSM Play which allows you to edit midi files and convert them into mmf. files.\nOne useful feature which this phone does not have is speaker phone.  Generally I don't like to hold the phone next to my ear, or use the ear pieces.  The speaker phone on the Nokia is great for this purpose.\nAnother minor inconvinence with this phone is the phone's IrDa capability with your PC.  As I have mentioned already you will need to download an application from Samsung Europe in order to transfer data from your PC to your Phone.  With some other phones such as the Sony Ericcson T610 you can simply transfer files through Window's default program when you match your phone's infra red port with your laptop's.  Of course EasyGPRS also have the ability to do many other things but sometimes I wish that I can transfer simple images/sounds directly using just windows.\nFinally, the battery on this phone runs out a little faster than some other phones.  If you play around with this phone often the battery will run out in a day.  If you don't it will last 2-3 days.\nCurrently this is not the best cell phone on the market but this is definitely one of the best Tmobile GSM phones at the moment.

On actual use, I have been quite disappointed.  Still, let me say up front that it deserves three stars for being a usable, pocketable smart phone.\nMy biggest gripe lies with the keyboard, which is too small and too minimalistic.  It's very easy to press two keys at the same time, so whatever Handspring said about this being the best designed thumboard ever, don't believe it.  The keys have a round surface, which hurts your fingers after a typing a little while.  But the biggest problem again is the spacing of the keys, which are just too small and too close together.\nAlso, there are no dedicated number keys, which is extremely annoying.  To add more woes to this limitation, you cannot num-lock the numeric keys, so you always have to hold down the number shift key to type in numbers.  Someone clearly wasn't thinking straight when they put this together.  Get this: it's easier to type in accented letters (which aren't used in English) than punctuations.  That is just plain silly.\nThe screen is also too small, and the viewing angle isn't too good, which means unless you look at it straight on, you will have a hard time seeing what's on the screen.  Compared to the silk-smooth screens on the Tungsten and Clie, this one feels crude and pixelated.\nNow, if you plan to use the Treo 600 for web surfing, be prepared to be really disappointed.  The internet speed is just plain pathetic.  Loading Amazon.com's home page took over 3 minutes, and it's barely readable because the layout is all screwed up.  Loading MSN's home page took even longer, although the pictures did come across nicely.  For some reason I've not been able to open Apple's homepage at all.  No error messages, just no page, either.  MSNBC works fine, so does Yahoo and Sprint PCS's own home page (good thing, there!).\nIn short, I'm pretty disappointed with the implementation.  A new model, the Treo 610, is rumored to come out soon, with a better screen and improved battery life -- but probably still the same slow Internet speed, which is more a problem with the 2.5G network than the Treo hardware per se.

Now I can't imagine living without it!\n\nSome of the other reviewers don't seem to understand what they bought.  They ordered a wireless plan on Amazon and didn't realize that it came with a Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee.  Then they were asked to write a review before they even realized what they got.\n\nBut a little experience shows that this Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee is a marvel of innovation that is packed with value!\n\nThink about it.  There was a time when phone companies were much more heavily regulated.  Then congress passed lots of new laws to change phone company regulation and allow more competition.  These laws are extremely complicated, and the congressmen needed help writing them.  So, the phone companies came to the rescue with teams of lobbyists to help write the new laws!\n\nThe problem was that those lobbyists were extremely expensive. To make matters worse, the phone companies knew that if they didn't get everything they wanted, they'd have to hire even more expensive lawyers to fight the laws.  So in exchange for agreeing to deregulation, they invented the beautifully-named Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee.  Hurray!\n\nThis wonderful invention allows the phone companies to charge an extra fee over-and-above the rates that they are allowed to charge for their services, so that they can fund the very expensive effort of fighting the other parts of the laws that they don't like!  They can make the fee any amount they want, because it doesn't actually go to any government or regulatory body.  It just goes straight to the phone company so they can hire more lawyers.  With high-powered Washington lawyer/lobbyists charging $400 an hour, you can imagine how hard it would be to survive without these great fees!\n\nWhat's even more brilliant is the name.  \"Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee\" is one of the greatest product names ever.  It just screams out \"I'm official.\"  It sounds so much like a tax, people actually believe that it is one, and it sounds so official, nobody questions the exact amount.\n\nIn summary, this is one brilliant product that's packed with value.", "summary": "Don't Know How I Ever Survived Without This Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee!", "unixReviewTime": 1173398400}, {"overall": 1.0, "vote": "4", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2006", "reviewerID": "ALXAQM2YIBQDG", "asin": "B00020KCBK", "reviewerName": "servant74", "reviewText": "Yep, we (consumers) allow phone companies to charge us this 'optional' charge. ...

Unfortunately, after acquiring a few other units I have come to the conclusion that many critics have been correct.  While I still think this is a decent phone, it appears to have been plagued with inconsistent manufacturing standards, slightly cheaper components, and higher failure rates than other Sanyo models.\n\nThe Sanyo 8200 is a solid phone that will be far superior to many alternatives. Not to mention, with the deals you get for signing a 2 year agreement, this phone can be a great value. Sanyo added a few extra nice features for this phone like an alarm (yippie!!!) and appointment calendar. But overall, the features are only slightly above average compared with the current generation of phones. Let's face it, some of these newer phones have really raised our expectations.\n\nThe phone camera is not top-end but decent for daytime use. Of course the speakerphone quality is high quality as usual with Sanyo phones.\n\nThe signal strength isn't as good as the 4900 or the 8300.  I suspect they cut corners on the antenna. If you are a person that demands 5 bars in every location, get the 8300 instead. In addition, the MM7500 and the 9000 will probably both offer stronger antennae with their superior next gen features.  While the reception sounds fine, this phone averages 2-3 bars.\n\nThe screen resolution is also good but not fantastic. The memo recorder could have used much more memory.\n\nSprint coverage is better than advertised as long as you use a good phone. Customer service is not as great as it used to be, but it's still better than Verizon.  I'm switching friends off of Verizon to Sprint. Believe me, if you have bad reception, you have a bad phone and it's time to use that warrantee. With this phone, I've had to go back to the Sprint store countless times to get them to swap it out.\n\nSeveral reviewers have stated they have problems with sounding garbled during conversations. Most likely, this is another case where you need to utilize that warranty or return policy. When the phone is good, it's good. If you're having problems, you probably have one of the 30% of these phones that comes off the manufacturing line with hardware issues. They might not give you another model, but they definitely have to replace the phone.\n\nAlso, be mindful of the firmware version of this phone.  Even replacement versions are shipping at rev 25.  You should go to the store to update your phone to rev 29 or better.\n\nOne thing that is a big disappointment is the lack of accessories that come standard with this phone. Not to mention, when are manufacturers going to make a data cable standard?\n\nUnfortunately these criticisms apply to all phones. Sanyo has added some nice features to this model. Even with its flaws, it's a decent deal for the price. If you can afford the next generation, however, I would recommend it.  Best wishes!", "summary": "Sanyo comes down to earth.

It was a cute little phone that was the second cell phone from any U.S. carrier that could take pictures.  (The first-ever model was the SCP-5300 also from Sanyo, released in July 2002.)  The PM-8200 addressed two shortcoming of the 8100: 1) camera quality, and 2) speakerphone.\nThe 8200 sports a higher-resolution built-in camera.  Picture quality is also improved.  The old 8100's pictures often had streaks and distorted colors.  The 8200's pictures look much better.  The speakerphone is definitely a great addition for those of us who like to multi-task yet dislike headsets.  The volume and clarity could be a little better, but given the compact size of this phone, it's not bad.\nReception on the 8200 is great, thanks to its external antenna.  Battery life is good, unless you save a lot of things in memory, which depletes battery faster the more stuff it holds.  The phone is attractive and can be customized in many ways, not to mention it comes in three colors.  To Sanyo, I suggest you use the iPod Mini color scheme, because not many people like big red!\nIn summary, the 8200 delivers lots of improvements over the already-excellent 8100.

Right out of the box it was easy to pair with my Motorola v505 phone.\n\nIt is small and unobtrusive\n\nThe battery life is really good in standby mode, and lasts several hours of talking. (and it does issue warning tones when the battery runs low, plus the phone issues a message saying \"headset signal weak - switch to handset?\"\n\nThe combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea.  It would have been EVEN COOLER if Jabra had made it compatible with nokia, Moto, and Ericsson phone chargers.  Now I have yet ANOTHER power supply to drag with me on trips....\n\nReception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water.  I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk.  If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically.  In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket.  If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nI have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however (an HP iPaq 4155).\n\nIf you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is \"connected\" (from Activesync's perspective).  You will hear a constant \"crackling\" noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn.  It took me a while to figure out.  You don't have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just \"disconnect\" the BT session temporarily while talking.  This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)\n\nMy biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure.  The \"hanging\" design always feels like it is flopping around for me, and if I lean too far to that side, the unit will actually fall off my ear.  There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces, but this doesn't help.  This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another.  Its a shame, since it is such a nice unit, but the floppiness on my ears is unacceptable.\n\nBTW, I am not a midget - I am 5' 10 and weigh 160 lbs.

The other minor inconvenience are the buttons; they don't have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.\n\nIf it's one thing I would REALLY like, then it's a replaceable [rechargeable] battery.

There aren't many ear mounted devices that I can get on with at all, so if you have big ears this may be for you.\n\nSound: Received sound is weak at best, if you don't have good hearing this isn't going to work for you. Transmitted sound is also weak, apparently, I have to accept what others tell me. If I want to talk quietly I have to use the phone, the headset forces me to talk loudly so that I can be heard. Noise cancelling is non-existant, if it was supposed to have any. The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.\n\nRF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can't answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing, by the time it's connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK, but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.\n\nAll in all I'd keep looking, which is why I'm browsing headsets now.\n\nIn ten years I really haven't yet found a \"good\" headset, nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use, like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations, but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I'd pay a couple of hundred bucks.

However, after some discussion with T-mobile customer service and a visit to the T-mobile office, I discovered that T-mobile had not properly prepared my phone...not Motorola's fault!\n\nMy V600's performance has been outstanding. Extremely long standby and talk times. The bluetooth connection works very well. I use mine with a Jabra BT250.\n\nThis is my third generation Motorola. After years of Nokia phones, I received a Motorola Timeport as a gift (terrible phone with lousy menus). The next year I won a v66 in a raffle. I was pleasantly surprised with the v66, especially it small size. Motorla had significantly improved the menu from the Timeport, but it still wasn't the best. The V600's menu has improved on the V66.\n\nThe V600's color screen is wonderfully clear and the pre-loaded ringtones are very nice. I don't really use the camera feature, but the few times that I fooled around with it found that it took decent pictures. Finally, I was concerned about the V600's size until I actually had it in my hand. While it is a little bit bigger than the V66, it is not much bulkier.

Sharp", "reviewText": "1 year update - I use these way more than I ever thought I would. I sweat in them on long runs, I wear them driving to talk (one ear only, obviously), and I wear them around the house listening to podcasts. They have never failed to pair, they have never sounded bad.\n\nMy only dislike is that they bounce around if you run with them. In winter (now) I tuck them under my jacket, but in summer they bounce and are annoying, but still usable. In summer I use 2 large safety pins to secure the ends to my shirt to keep them from moving around on my neck.\n\nAnd once I had to clear the memory (read how online at moto website).this was when I'd upgraded to a new phone and had too many devices paired, I think.\n\n1 month Update: I've been asked how they hold up with sweat (see below). No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill, but I must stress that I've not put in a summer run. I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product, and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating. HOWEVER, since you asked, they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running, but it's not intolerable... Just not ideal. BATTERY: I've used them every day since I got them, and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym. They last from morning to night constantly connected. I often forget I'm wearing them when I turn on my music and don't hear any sound from my phone/tablet.\n\nEdit: just for the record, the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product, it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.\n=============================================================\n\nI bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I've used them several times, so that is my comparison point.\n\nThese headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)\n\nThe ear pieces, at first, I was worried about them. They didn't look like they would be very secure, but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces, so every time you move, you don't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.\n\nAnd taking them out to hear the world around you is nice, because of the magnets. No flopping around.\n\nThe built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.\n\nSo you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds, but you get a great ease of use, very good sound, and less than half the price.\n\nAnd truthfully, while they aren't super stylish... People are walking around with those giant beats studio headphones on. These look way less ridiculous than that, and really aren't that bad.

Yoon", "reviewText": "I always care most about sound quality and signature of a Bluetooth earbuds or headphones.\nfor me, that is the most important aspect of \"good BT headphone.\"\n\nAs far as sound quality and signature are concerned, this Motorola SF500 is one of the best in the class.  Specially, for the money I paid for ($19 with Lightening deal), it is an awesome BT headphone.  Very refined clear mid and high with decent, tight bass which is not very common at this price range.  Also when I check the built quality, it is solidly built and designed.  I should say that it can be compared to more expensive models of LG or Samsung BT headphones (but I like SF500 Sound quality much more).\n\nEven though I like the sound quality very much, I wish that the volume level could be bit louder.  When I compared to other similar price range BT headphones, such as SoundPEATS QY7 or Mpow, the volume isn't quite loud enough.  It could go up one or two notch louder...\nAlso unlike Samsung, LG and even Mpow, SF500 has very ridge body that you can not really bend as you like. For me, it fits me well enough since I have a normal size neck, but I can see that if someone with fatter or bigger neck, it might not fit comfortably due to its stiffness in the body of headphone.  Also, it has 3 EQ settings.  Personally I like the second one the most which brings out clear mid and high.  It is a good feature to have.\n\nThere are couple of black rubber rings to keep the wires and adjust the length of the earbud wires.  it is just a couple of flimsy rubber bands that could be broken in a week or two.  I hope that they had used something stronger plastic type rather than cheap & weak black rubber band.\nalso, as you can see in the photos, the earbuds will be attached to the tips of the headphone by magnets.  The magnets are rather strong and they get attached well enough, but it seemed to me that how they made it was some sort of after thought.  Basically, it does not look good nor functionally well designed.  I rather prefer to see Samsung or LG type of more hidden and secure looking attachments.\n\nFinally, the earbuds are very small. Entire earbud structures and design are very small. Even the rubber earbuds that comes with 3 different sizes are smaller and flatter designed than other 99% of earbuds.  I think when I use the biggest earbuds, it works well enough and I get adequate seals when I listen to music.  But I just feel that they might slip off when I am running or doing some activities.\n\nMotorola SF500 is well made.  Good sounding and solid structure. However, there are many things to be improved.

Anyway, here we go.\n\nSaw a flash sale for some Motorola SF500 Earbuds from Dailysteals.com. My last pair of earbuds stopped powering on. So, I jumped on these for the cheap price. Got these in two days with regular postal shipping.\n\nNo pics of the box they came in. I'm guessing these are either returned or refurbished. Everything was in labeled plastic bags.\n\nI received the earbuds, 3 set of ear tips, 1 charger with 2 ports,  USB cable, and a bag.\n\nWhen looking at the picture, on the left side, the bottom lowers and top button raises the volume. On the right side, the bottom button is play/pause. The top button forwards to the next song.\n\nThe headset paired easily to my HTC M8. The phone found the headset right way and paired.\n\nThe earpiece cables have rubber bands around them to keep them close to the headset. Its up to you if you want them on or not. Right now, I have them on.\n\nPlayed some Logic from Play Music and bass is decent. A little too much treble for me but I'll live with it. The headset sounds good when both ear pieces are in your ears.\n\nThe magnets that connect the earpieces to the headset is really good. They have not fallen once so far.\n\nI'm enjoying this headset so far. The accessibility and ease are outstanding. The headset feels light around my neck.\n\nI have no comparisons for these. These are my first pair of this type of headset. When this style first came out,  It wasn't on my radar to purchase some. I'm glad I did now. What took me so long?\n\nI'm no audiophile but I would refer someone to these.  They come in black or white.\n\nI have not made any phone calls yet.\n\nThanks for reading my first product review.

Appears to be broken wires from moving. However, Moto support is great and I willingly bought a third pair (second being the free replacement of initial pair) after my warranty ran out.\n\nLonger review:\nI listen to loads of audiobooks. Easily eight hours a day, as I do chores and such. If my husband is out of town and I keep listening into the night, I can hit, like, fifteen hours of audio in a day. So I needed some headphones that weren't going to die on me within a month, like all the $10 pairs I'd kept compromising on.\n\nFor Hannukah 2014, my husband got me a pair of Motorola Buds, and I instantly fell in love. Never again were my earbuds yanked from my ears as the cord twisted, and the bluetooth was strong enough that I could have my phone charge centrally in my house and be able to walk about without losing reception. Not being an audio snob, I also found the sound quality for music to be fine. The battery life was just about right, though my headphones did die on me about once or twice a month, but, again, at least eight hours continuous use.\n\nHowever, as I said above, the right earbud keeps dying. It crackles a bit for a day or two, and then it's more like silence with a little crackling in every so often. My first pair of Buds started failing on June 10th, 2015, based on my e-mails (and I got the gift in mid-December). Luckily, Motorola has always been great about replacements for me (I also had a Moto X, which I broke...twice...). I was able to show my Amazon receipt and get a replacement in within a week, with Motorola paying shipping all ways.\n\nBut, today, January 4th, and JUST out of the one year warranty, my second pair of buds has died again. I checked Amazon, to see if any other products might compare, but everything I saw looked like small, shady companies with really, really bad grammar in their text. And the reviews...generally did not seem like real reviews, so much as paid reviews.\n\nSo I bought another pair, and I'm okay with that, because I LOVE THESE THINGS! $30 a year for exactly what I want in headphones is fine with me!\n\nNow, granted, when this next warranty runs out?

I've been using a $12 set of buds for almost a year and have put up with the hassle of the wires just because they sound so flippin good.  With a frequency response of 10 to 20,000Hz, I got all the bass I wanted as well as mid to high range.  That said, I was leery about BT ear buds but I've always been a fan of Moto products even though I have a Samsung Avant phone so I decided to give them a try.\n\nI got the buds yesterday, charged them up and tried them out.  I placed them on my neck and they curved down and rested on my collar bone very comfortably.  I turned them on with the button which is located in the back; kind of awkward but not a deal breaker.  Pairing them with my Samsung  Avant phone was very quick and easy; the Avant recognized them immediately and all I had to do was confirm the pairing. The first thing I noticed was that the sound wasn't as rich or deep as I had hoped.  The buds felt like they wanted to pull out because the connecting wires seemed to stretch to their limits as I turned my head and I don't have a big neck and, even though I have been accused of having a big head, it is actually quite average.  I had read about this being an issue from another reviewer so I moved the adjustment bands all the way back to give me as much wire as possible and that helped but anything rubbing against them, like a shirt collar, might be a hindrance, plus, I was still bothered about the sound.\n\nI started playing with the buttons after reading the directions in the instruction manual and found they were reversed from my buds.  It showed the volume on the on the left side but when I pushed the left front button, I got the EQ.  Rotating through the EQ's didn't seem to make much difference.  The volume adjustment was actually on the right side and the call/play and track buttons are on the left side.  Once I got that figured out, I was ok.  Also, if you have a smart watch, you might not even have to worry about the controls.  I have a Moto360 and it also pairs to the phone at the same time as the buds so that just a plus for me.\n\nBack to the buds.  Because the buds come with the smallest ear pieces installed, I thought it might help to use the medium buds so I switched them for the small ones and they helped with the problem of them staying in my ears but didn't really improve the sound.  (By the way, they fit on the headset pretty snuggly so I don't think they will likely fall off and get lost.) While wearing them today, I found that the sound was okay with voices like comedy routines and wasn't too bad for normal music but I wanted more base.  I discovered that if I cupped my hands over my ears that I could hear the deeper base of the techno music I was listening to ... but I looked like an idiot so that wasn't a solution.  I was actually ready to send them back for a refund but when I got home I decided to try one more thing.  If I was covering the buds with my hands and they sounded better, maybe sound was \"leaking out\" so I tried the larger ear pieces.  In all honesty, that sounds like a stupid explanation but the bigger ear pieces do give me more base ... not nose bleed bass but adequate.  So, I listened to Southern rock to Techno to Classical and they all sound great to these aging ears so now I'll just have to see how the battery life is.\n\nAs for the Bluetooth, now that I have them paired, they hook up almost instantly.  I can't use them in the car because I have a BT transmitter for the stereo and they conflict with each other but other than that, I can roam around without dropping the BT on the earbuds.  By the way, I also noticed a difference in the EQ by switching ear pieces, albeit ever so slight.  One setting sounds like it has less bass, one with a little more and one with almost a slight bassy echo.\n\nSo, for me, the only cons (kind of) right now are:\n  - Power button is in the back behind your neck so are not real convenient.\n  - Status light is in the back behind your neck (not a problem if you have eyes in the back of your head).\n  - Connecting wires for the buds could be a tad longer.\n  - Sound could be fuller but probably decent for this price point.\nbut none of these are a real reason to deduct a star", "summary": "Could be better but very nice at this price point", "unixReviewTime": 1438646400}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2015", "reviewerID": "AO5JBAQIJFJPU", "asin": "B0002SYC5O", "style": {"Color:": " Black", "Package Type:": " Standard Packaging"}, "reviewerName": "K.

Always ready to go when you are.\n- Lightweight and comfortable around the neck. You forget they're even there.\n- Microphone is excellent, clear, loud, and crisp.\n- Price! These are half the price of your Sony SBH or your LG Tones, and the battery life is better as a trade off for sound quality and style.\n\nCons:\n- Earbud cables are a bit constraining if you have a long neck. They sometimes pop out of the ear when you turn your head suddenly.\n- Music quality is not the greatest, but will do in a pinch.\n- First pair I ordered had a defective left ear bud. Amazon to the rescue there. Quick and painless RMA and the next set were perfect.\n\nTo Buy or Not to Buy:\n- If you want style and rich quality sound for music and media playback, look elsewhere.\n- If you need a go to \"git 'er done\" headset for calls and basic audio, and you don't want to break the bank, these are for you!\n\nThe Moto Buds are extremely lightweight and easy to pair with nearly every device that supports BlueTooth 4.0. They are comfortable in the ear for extended wear (2-4 hours), the battery life is astoundingly good, and they sleep without draining battery better than the LG Tones or the Sony SBH series.\n\nBut every rose has its thorns, and alas the Moto Buds are not without their flaws. The first is these danged ear bud cables. Someone in accounting figured out the average neck length and forced the designers to shorten these things to exactly that length and no longer. As a person of above average height, this poses a problem for me, as the cables stay nearly taut all the time, even when I'm looking straight ahead. Turn your head to the left or right and at best you're going to loosen one bud, or completely pull it out of your ear at worst.\n\nI've learned to forgive the Moto Buds for this over time because whenever I need them, they work perfectly. I regularly pair them with a laptop, tablet, and phone, and switching between those devices is remarkably simple and straight forward. Oh, and they're less than half the price of the competition. Let's not forget that!\n\nSound quality is adequate, but basses are not as deep, and highs are not as clear as other, more music-focused headsets. These are your go-to utilitarian communication earbuds, that will also let you listen to Taylor Swift on your coffee break. She just won't sound as good.\n\nThe controls for music and volume are a tad awkwardly placed, and learning how to use the textured skip button as the pause/play button also is a little tricky, but once you've learned it, you've mastered it.\n\nMoto would do well to increase the earbud cable length, even if only by 5 centimeters, to allow the wearer more freedom of movement. However, if you'll be wearing these while sitting at your desk or driving in your car most of the time, you'll have no trouble at all, especially if you are of average height or less.", "summary": "The Moto Buds are your bud!", "unixReviewTime": 1435881600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2015", "reviewerID": "A2WETUVXYVR1G0", "asin": "B0002SYC5O", "style": {"Color:": " Black", "Package Type:": " Standard Packaging"}, "reviewerName": "Baaqeel, Ali Hassan", "reviewText": "outstanding", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1435795200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2015", "reviewerID": "A5EQMW2JRM5XN", "asin": "B0002SYC5O", "style": {"Color:": " Black", "Package Type:": " Standard Packaging"}, "reviewerName": "MrsDiva2YOU", "reviewText": "One of the best headsets i ever brought", "summary": "i would recommend this item", "unixReviewTime": 1435536000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2015", "reviewerID": "A2Z7X2T4J7HV4K", "asin": "B0002SYC5O", "style": {"Color:": " Black", "Package Type:": " Standard Packaging"}, "reviewerName": "Julian Daci", "reviewText": "Great headset!", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1435536000}, {"overall": 2.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2015", "reviewerID": "A3401TN544EH2Q", "asin": "B0002SYC5O", "style": {"Color:": " Black", "Package Type:": " Standard Packaging"}, "reviewerName": "stearnshd", "reviewText": "Simple, no frills, and the quality is bad.

Knew", "reviewText": "I have owned these headphones for over a year now.  I can say that they are pretty solid performers.  I use them fairly regularly, probably about 15-20 hours a week, and have both used them connected to my laptop and to my Nexus 5.\n\nPROS:\n\nBattery Life: is very good.  I can usually use them for a day and a half before they need to be charged again, and charging typically takes about 2 hours I would guess.\n\nSound: is decent provided you have the proper sized ear gels, (more on this later).\nComfort: Weight and flat wires are nice, with the \"brains\" of the unit being at the rear, it balances this device out a bit.\n\nLongevity: My warranty is now expired, and I never had to use it.  Owned for 14 months and no issues with my pair.\n\nCONS and Caveats:\n\nRange: I haven't had big problems with wandering away from my phone, but they definitely don't really have a \"half-football-field\" range as advertised.  I imagine if you were walking away from your phone on a football field, you could get up to 50 yards away, but the 150 foot advertised range is obviously with no interference.  I can get across my office building though before they start to lose signal, but the signal loss is worse if I say, turn around (with my head/neck directly between the phone and the receiver) I probably lose 15-20 feet of range.\n\nEQ: the three EQ settings are pointless, I can hear almost no difference between them, and the \"EQ changed\" voice is not particularly helpful.  I wish it would say \"flat\" or \"bass boost\" for whatever setting it gets switched to.\n\nLong winded power on: This is a pretty silly preference, but they are long in the tooth when turned on.  Sometimes if I'm in mid call and turn these on, I want to connect right away, but I have to wait for (and read this out loud so you can see how long it takes), \"(Bingy sound effect that plays for about 1 second) Welcome to the Motorola Buds.  Device one connected.\"  This power on cycle takes roughly six seconds, during which phone audio cannot be heard.\n\nEar gels (IMPORTANT): This is probably going to be the biggest factor as to whether you are satisfied with these or not.  These headphones will be nowhere near loud enough and have terrible bass response if you do not have the best fit for your ear to create the \"seal\" between the driver (or speaker) and your ear canal.  I have a good fit and sound in my left ear, but none of the three included sizes seem to work well with my right ear.  If I'm wearing both, it doesn't bother me too much, and I very frequently only have one in when I'm at work so I can still hear people talk to me if I'm needed.  Right ear alone, however, is not an option for me.  If you ever lose or replace your ear-tips/gels, replacements are simply \"unavailable\" per Motorola.  I still have all mine, but Motorola tells me, if you lose them or they become damaged, Motorola just replaces the entire headset, (really, Motorola?)", "summary": "After a year, Solid, but not for everyone.", "unixReviewTime": 1435017600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2015", "reviewerID": "A1G23TATLJLPFK", "asin": "B0002SYC5O", "style": {"Color:": " Black", "Package Type:": " Standard Packaging"}, "reviewerName": "John", "reviewText": "Great", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1434758400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2015", "reviewerID": "A2R20OYTXJRSVX", "asin": "B0002SYC5O", "style": {"Color:": " Black", "Package Type:": " Standard Packaging"}, "reviewerName": "john w farmer", "reviewText": "Should have bought these first.

I primarily use these while commuting, so a mix of walking on city streets, subways, and the bus. I have three issues with the Motorola Buds -- 1) sound quality, 2) fit and length of cable, and 3) some weird bluetooth connection issues.\n\nSOUND QUALITY: These are OK. In terms of sound, I think the Sony MW600 with stock earbuds have better sound. These are ok, but the bass is a bit muddy and the treble is a bit recessed. Volume is good. Phone quality is OK -- the other side reports sounding like I'm on a speakerphone.\n\nFIT AND CABLE LENGTH: Perhaps my body is shaped weird, but I think the earbuds are a little too short -- again, the stock earbuds with the Sony MW600 fit my ears better. I struggle to find a good seal, and when I do, just opening my mouth or turning my head is enough to loosen them. I've tried all three earpiece sizes, and the best fitting one is the medium one. As others have noted, due to the slightly smaller than normal earbuds, most other earpieces won't fit this one. The cable length could use another half inch -- while walking around, looking while crossing the street causes the cable to tug at my ears.\n\nBLUETOOTH CONNECTION: Range is OK -- I can make it maybe 30 feet in my apartment. However, my biggest problem is that, during times of silence (say when switching tracks), the Motorola Buds will emit a short \"pop\" sound, and then it'll skip maybe 100 ms at the beginning of a song. I'm using an iPhone 5 with iOS 8.3. This is a bit annoying, and I can live with it, but this wasn't a problem with the Sony MW600.\n\nAs an aside, I purchased mine through Verizon, so I'm pretty sure mine is an original and not a counterfeit.\n\nOtherwise, it looks nice, the buttons have a nice tactile feel, and it looks nice.

That was discouraging, but I might have been able to live with it, except that it would expose the inside wiring to all kinds of environmental debris and eventually shorten the life of the earbuds. The thing that finally made me decide to return them (with a heavy heart) was that the sound quality had deteriorated noticeably in the right earbud when I was doing my (low impact) workout this morning. It was crackling and popping and fading in and out, which it had never done before. I don't know if this is due to me trying to glue down the rubber stripping (I used the blunt end of a sewing needle to apply the glue, so it was a precision glue job, I'll tell you!), or if the headset itself was just falling apart, but that was the last straw. It's obvious that there is either an engineering, manufacturing, or quality problem with this product. So I would caution would-be buyers to consider this carefully before investing your money in these earbuds. Amazon was very good about sending me a return label, so they're packed up and ready to go to UPS tomorrow, but what a sad experience. I really thought I had found the perfect Bluetooth headphones!!! Let the buyer beware - it may have been that I just got a bad pair, but I read at least one other review that mentioned this very same problem with the rubber stripping underneath the \"collar\", so I know I was not the only one. That's really bad, that these earbuds went from five stars two days ago to one star today.\n\nUPDATE #1 - IMPORTANT: It's ONE DAY after I wrote my stellar review on these earbuds. Well, folks, this morning I went to put on my Motorola Buds and - you guessed it - a problem. As noted in at least one other review, the rubbery trim on the bottom of the headset stalks has separated from the unit, on both sides. I just spent a half hour trying to glue the trim back down, and it kept coming up again, no matter how carefully I applied the glue. THIS SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY. I have had these for just under two weeks and this SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING.  This is the part that rests against your neck and collarbone, so it SHOULD be fastened (by whatever means necessary) well enough that the trim does not separate, because this is the part of the earbud \"stalks\" that is going to receive the most friction by rubbing against your skin. I can't believe Motorola did not either engineer this better or manufacture it so that this would not be a problem. I am MOST disappointed in this occurrence. I just reapplied the glue for the third time and I'm letting it sit, if it doesn't work this time, back they go. I realize these are not the most expensive buds on the market, but two weeks of wear and it's falling apart????? So now we're down to three stars, instead of the five they had yesterday. Because they're NOT holding up well, even over the short run. Below you'll find my original review, before this morning's problem:\n\nOriginal review: I LOVE THESE BUDS!!!!! I have had them for about ten days or so, so I can't speak to how well they'll hold up over time. Now, for me to say I love ANY earbuds is a huge compliment, because I have gone through at least a dozen pairs (or more) of various designs of earbuds, trying to find that \"perfect\" fit/sound/convenience factor. At first, I was a little hesitant about ordering something that went around my neck and then had the wires that went up to my ears, being used to the usual design of most of the earbuds on the market. And I wasn't sure I wanted to be walking around my workplace with a piece of hardware around my neck on a daily basis. However, there is a photograph of a woman wearing a pair of these on the Amazon page, and they didn't look that bad, just kind of different. So I took the plunge and ordered a set of black ones.\n\nI was very pleased with how easily these buds paired with both my Moto-E phone and my iPads, so that is a plus. The acid test was: how well would they hold up at work? I am at work approximately nine hours a day and I just knew I would have to take these buds off and charge them at some point during the day. I was also wondering how long they would take to charge. Well, let me tell you, they played music continuously for the ENTIRE 9 hours. It was only when I was on my way home that I got the little voice that said \"Low battery\". So I can listen to music all day long without recharging these earbuds, and I think that's fabulous. I work in a very distracting and sometimes loud environment, so my music is what helps to calm and focus me. My last set of Bluetooth earbuds would only play for two hours without running out of power and having to be recharged for almost an hour. So that was three recharges per day - pretty poor, compared to these buds. The Motorola buds fully charge in roughly 90 minutes - not long at all, for the battery life you get.  An extra bonus with these earbuds: I can walk clear to the back of our building from my desk (about 75 feet) and still get signal, albeit spotty. And that's through three interior walls!\n\nAs far as looks and comfort, having these earbuds around my neck doesn't bother me at all. They might look a little \"different\" to someone who doesn't know what they are, but they save my sanity at work so I don't care. As an aside for any ladies considering these, they don't mess up your hair!!!!  And they are lightweight to the point of me forgetting I even have them on a lot of the time. As other people have observed, they are designed well enough that they don't twist around that much on my neck. Occasionally they get a little cockeyed, but not that much, because if they get too far out of alignment the earbuds themselves will not fit correctly, so it's kind of a self-correcting situation. The other thing is, I am horribly earbud-challenged. Earbuds do NOT stay in my ears, with the exception of the standard Apple earbuds. These earbuds have a unique design that somehow manages to fit in both of my ears, and they stay put, for the most part. I do, however, have to fool with them some to get that \"perfect seal\". But it's getting easier as time goes by. I have had occasion to take a phone call using these (I normally don't get outside phone calls during my work day), and they functioned perfectly for that as well. I was afraid maybe the caller might not be able to hear me, but he indicated it was not a problem at all and could hear me just fine. The controls are pretty easy to use once you get to know which button does what. Sound quality is, for me, excellent. I am not an audiophile, so I can't address the finer points of the quality of the sound, but it works perfectly for me.\n\nMy only concern now is how long these Motorola earbuds will last. I have noticed some reviews that complained about that very issue, so I am watchfully waiting to see how they do. However, as with all my electronics, I am extremely careful with them, never bang them around, drop them, or expose them to moisture. I am hoping they last a good long time, because I am very, very happy with them and feel like I have FINALLY come to the end of my long search for the perfect earbuds to wear at work. I can't even tell you how many pairs of earbuds I've gone through over the last six years, but it's been a LOT, and they've all been discarded or given away, because of one reason or another, usually for not fitting/staying properly in my ears.\n\nMy verdict on these Motorola earbuds, after 10 or so days of use? Five stars. And I would give them six if I could. However, as I said, I will be watching closely for any signs of premature failure, and will update this review should that happen. Right now I'm a VERY happy camper, and would recommend them without any reservation whatsoever.", "summary": "Don't bother...these have a quality problem", "unixReviewTime": 1409270400}, {"overall": 2.0, "vote": "2", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "08 25, 2014", "reviewerID": "A35AZL7RP2ZP6E", "asin": "B0002SYC5O", "style": {"Color:": " Black", "Package Type:": " Standard Packaging"}, "reviewerName": "Akhenatonio", "reviewText": "I purchased the Motorola Buds after my LG HBS-700's had a left ear malfunction after a couple of years of use.  I looked around for something better, since the HBS-700's were originally created back in 2011 and everywhere I look someone has the LG's, either the 700 or 800 series, or a knockoff.  I wanted something different, and thought that the Motorola Buds would be better in every way given that it is new technology.  I was wrong.\n\n1. Build\nThe way that the LG's fit is very comfortable compared to these.  The Motorola Buds feel like you have a dog collar around your neck.  If you wear a shirt and tie to work, forget about it.  They look like they are just sitting on top of your clothes like a clothes hanger would if you could imagine wearing a clothes hanger around your neck to listen to music.  They are rigid and not very flexible.  Putting on the Motorola Buds feels like you are opening metal thongs to put around your neck.  The thickness of the device on the back of your neck is not a good design and feels wrong.  Maybe I'm biased because the LG's were so comfortable?\n\nThe magnets that are used to attract the earbuds and keep them secure are very strong, so strong that the glue that sticks the metal tips to the plastic came undone. So now I must re-glue the metal tips to the \"collar\" so that the earbuds stay connected like they should.\n\nLet me also mention something about the power button and it's placement.  When I store these in my bag during the day when I'm not using them, they will mysteriously turn on.  I figure it's because when there is any pressure applied to the bag, for let's say 3 seconds at a time, the headset will turn on.  This is because the power button is as such that you must depress it for about 3 seconds before the unit turns on, unlike the LG's HBS-700's, which was a sliding button.\n\n2. Earbuds\nThey continually fall out of my ear.  I am using the biggest rubber buds that came with the device, and they still slide out.  It's almost comical how it happens.  I could be still, and I can feel them steadily sliding out a nanometer every second till they are out, free to dangle.  I constantly have to put them back in. Frustrating.\n\nIf you want to run with these things, that is even funnier.  The earbuds will slide out over and over again.  They will prevent you from concentrating on the music while running because of the infuriating frustration they bring while wearing them.  Having to keep holding them in place is not what I want to do.  I want to be able to forget that they are on.  Not with these however.\n\nOh, and if you need to turn your head to the left or right, you can't without the earbuds falling out.  It's like the cables are not long enough to facilitate such movement comfortably.  You have to turn your entire body to look to either side.  It's like when you get stiff neck, and need to move your body to see left and right.  This is what it feels like when you wear the Motorola Buds.\n\n3. Sound\nThese earbuds sound great, usually.  They almost sound like wired earbuds, when they want to work.  I have different music apps on my phone, and the music sounds differently on all of them when using the Motorola Buds.  When using the LG HBS-700's they pretty much sounded the same between apps, or better in some instances,  even if I disable all EQ settings; not with the Motorola Buds.  Sometimes music sounds muted.  Other times, they sound distorted.  I have found the music app these sound best with by trial and error.  Not all my music is shared among the music apps because I use different cloud services like Amazon Music.  Power Amp seems to be able to play the locally stored music the best, but can't access cloud music,  I have to use the respective services for that and am thus relegated to crappy sounding music when I have to.\n\n4. Usability\nDO NOT USE THESE WHILE WORKING OUT OR RUNNING.  They are not sweat proof.  After running, then working out, the earbuds began to malfunction, and stopped working for the remainder of the day.  They would not turn on.  After a day sitting, they finally worked normally.\n\n5. Summary\nThese are very attractive bluetooth earphones, and you would think Motorola knew what they were doing when they made these, but they did everything a bluetooth earbud manufacturer shouldn't do.  If the earbuds were flexible, that would solve many issues.  If the cords were longer that would be nice.  If the earbuds were contoured to stay in my ear, that would be even better.  Perhaps if the back wasn't made to catch sweat so efficiently I would have a winner.  I have purchased foam replacements for the earbuds in the hopes that will help in comfort, sound quality, and staying in my ear.  Maybe I can wrap the electronics in saran wrap when I work out to prevent sweat from entering.  I am stuck with these until I figure something else out.  Anyway, I cannot recommend these earbuds.  Sorry Motorola.\n\nEdit: 9/2/14\n\nThe foam earbud replacements came in, and the sound quality is like night and day.  These earbuds sound awesome.  Plus, they stay in my ear.  I need to tug at them with some force for them to come out of my ear.  Excellent.  These are the earbuds I purchased: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIJTN5K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nAlso, I worked out again in these earbuds, and this time they quit working for two days.  I forgot to wrap them prior to working out.  If I can't work out and use these then they are pretty much useless for me.  Maybe I just need two different earbuds, one for commuting, and one for working out.  In the meantime, I will wrap them next time and report how that works.", "summary": "An Honest Review of a Terrible Design", "unixReviewTime": 1408924800}, {"overall": 1.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2014", "reviewerID": "A1ACCYFE74AO8X", "asin": "B0002SYC5O", "style": {"Color:": " Blue", "Package Type:": " Standard Packaging"}, "reviewerName": "DAMACHINE", "reviewText": "Worked for about 2 months.

BIG mistake -- the buds wouldn't pair with the Ariaz, and the vendor ducked my questions about his return policy.  Grrr...\n\nSo I came back to Amazon to check out customer reviews on other BT ear buds.\n\nIt sounded as if these Motorola Buds were getting good reviews, so I picked up a pair (from a store in NYC with a guaranteed return policy) -- and I must say, they're outstanding!!!\n\nLet me explain that I don't even have a smartphone, so I can't speak to these buds' capability handling phone conversations.  I ONLY wanted cordless buds so I could listen to music, and these Motos sound as good as any bud I've ever tried, including pairs from Bose, Klipsch, Sony, Sennheiser, you name it.\n\nAdd to the sound quality the comfort and superb ergonomics at work here -- and I have a new favorite pair of ear buds!\n\nThis behind-the-neck design is genius.  The necklace? yoke? carries the slight but sufficient weight of the electronics and battery so the buds don't keep falling out of your ears. You wear it inside the collar of your shirt, with the arms laying down in front.\n\nThe yoke also has convenient controls at the front of both arms -- volume up and down on one side; play/pause, track advance/reverse, and EQ settings on the other.  The buttons are raised so you can feel and operate them with your fingers.  Excellent!\n\nAlso cool is the way the buds attach magnetically to the ends of the necklace arms when you take them off.  Neat!\n\nI haven't fully tested battery life, but Motorola claims you get up to eleven hours of playtime on a 90-minute charge.  The buds come with a charger you plug into AC, plus a handy storage pouch and three sizes of bud tips to fit ear canals of different sizes.  I seem to be fine with the tips pre-installed, which I am guessing are the medium size.\n\nThe box talks about noise-canceling technology, but I think they're referring to something useful for phone conversations.  I can still hear sounds in the environment when I'm listening to music, but it's not intrusive, and the music comes through loud and clear.\n\nNow I have seen some reviews here saying these buds could have better bass or more volume.  Really?  As I said, the sound quality is superb on all types of music from classical to jazz to rock and soul, and the buds play as loud as you can stand without damaging your hearing.  I wonder if the complainers realize that you have to raise the volume on your BT player or smartphone to \"get in the zone.\"  And of course, as with any in-ear buds, you must make sure you're getting a proper seal, using the right size bud tips for your ears.\n\nOtherwise BT reception is splendid; I can lay the Ariaz down on a table and wander throughout my large studio apartment without any breakup or interference.\n\nSo if you're looking for a superb pair of ear buds that cut the cord and sound fantastic, I give these Motos my highest recommendation -- this is a brilliant product!\n\nPROS:\n\n* State-of-the-art sound.\n* Fabulous design with superior comfort and ergonomics.\n* Long battery life, fast charge time.\n* Plenty of volume.\n* Convenient controls for volume, play/pause, track selection, EQ.\n* Storage pouch, charger, different sizes of bud tips included.\n\nCONS:\n\n* The instructions say you shouldn't use these buds for working out, as they're not guaranteed sweat-proof.", "summary": "My New Best Buds", "unixReviewTime": 1402099200}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "441", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2014", "reviewerID": "A360VP3RBMJFDL", "asin": "B0002SYC5O", "style": {"Color:": " Black", "Package Type:": " Standard Packaging"}, "reviewerName": "Voyn238", "reviewText": "SPOILER ALERT: this is a stupidly long review. I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review, because thats the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all, but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until weve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee, or skip to the end, or skip this review entirely   Seriously though, its a long review. Prepare yourself.\n\nThis headset is about as close to ideal as I'm probably ever going to get, at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear, or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound, features, fit, and looks. There are a few downsides which I'll get out of the way first, and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First, I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when Im at work, underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar, and then make the trip back up to my ears. It's fine if I'm looking straight ahead, but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside' ear (if I look left, it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable, but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt, but aren't too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this one device at a time thing improves the handoff between music and calls, since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device, but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices, but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently, Ive got them paired with my Android tablet and phone, my iPod, and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each devices settings), so I don't have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch  pairing the Buds is not difficult at all, but that would get annoying real quick.\n\nNow that I've got that out of the way, I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds, which is pretty much everything. First off, let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3, S4, and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8), but there are others out there as well. If you're interested, there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com, but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesses page by searching for aptx enabled devices  it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet, and knowing them they'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so, so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola's site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X), but didn't like the \"flat loop\" design that most of them have  it looks like a great fit for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck, and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren't angled relative to the neck band, and they carry all the weight of the battery so theyll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds, but are $70 more expensive). Im wearing the Buds headset right now, and can hardly feel it  a great improvement over traditional earhugger Bluetooth headsets. While Im talking about fit, I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5 collar, and cant stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.\n\nThe Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left, and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch, which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsungs S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch, and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons, but its easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button, the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside, but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right, which come to think of it is a whole lot less busy since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch, and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker, and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the Play/Pause switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of EQ mode changed! but thats it. Youre on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat, treble boost, and bass boost. As a general audiophile rule, flat EQ response is best since it doesnt meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost, but cant tell the difference between the other two. And if I cant tell the difference, then I guess it doesnt really matter. Id recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music, getting to an EQ setting you like, and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature, the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong, and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact, they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don't attach it to the end of the stalk, Ill eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as Ive been moving around. Needless to say, don't get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.\n\nAs far as sound quality goes, Im really impressed. The earbuds are said to have Premium HD speakers, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don't support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid, and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that sparkle is added in any way, but if the music has fine detail in it then youll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly, the documentation talks a bit about about micro-adjustability, and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape, so the angle of the stem relative to the earbuds body can change a bit to fit different peoples ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat, I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as sweat proof, which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily, and do a lot of biking and walking, and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port, so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways, back to audio quality: One important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren't the best, and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they're also masking the fine detail of better quality files, so in a way its actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and Ive never had anyone ask Are you using Bluetooth? which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact, I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask Didnt you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?, and almost didn't believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality  if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmps EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity, and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25%, but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume, but since these things get plenty loud on their own, I don't mind at all.\n\nUsually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples ears make them look like extras from bad 80s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light, but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port, so its not visible at all while they're being worn. I have to say, at first I wasn't too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords, the silicone ear pieces, and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like its trying too hard. As I said, it practically disappears under a polo collar  all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When youve got an earbud inserted, the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you're either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say a little because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while Im in mid conversation. I have to make the universal Im not a lunatic, Im just on the phone gesture to most folks, but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue, which makes me even more sad that they don't come in red. You see, I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science, in which I have an overwhelming love (some, like my wife, would say unhealthy obsession) for black things with red trim, or red things with black trim, or  well, you get the idea. If these came in red, Id sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.\n\nThose are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don't really fit in the review elsewhere, so Ill stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet, but that is with a Class 1 Bluetooth device, which your phone probably isnt. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet, with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don't even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device, so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good, and although I try to charge the headset every night, Ive gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. Theyre rated at up to 12 hours of playback, but its anyones guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier, but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes  small, medium, and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already, but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable, but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me, you don't want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand, because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that youll hear as you turn the headset on and off, or change EQ settings, and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up, the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says Welcome to the Motorola Buds! When you connect to a phone or mp3 player, the same voice says Device 1 connected! The voice isn't too bad, but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call, it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phones ringtone. I think its a riff on the first few notes of Ride of the Valkyries but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft bloop noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these bloop noises, there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don't know what power state its in, hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own, which is a first for all the headsets Ive owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah, I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive, since I could not get it to pop back in, so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there, wiped off the excess, and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago, and it has not popped back up yet.\n\nSo thats absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that Ive made since I got them. If youve read through all that, I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary, which I promised at the start:\n\nFor the tl;dr crowd, I wholly approve of this headset. Its the headset Ive been waiting quite some time for, and its finally here. Features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and its hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this, its available here for $58, which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800, which normally goes for $130. Check these out  I don't think youll be disappointed.", "summary": "The headset I've been waiting for!

You have to be a contortionist to turn it on and off if they are on your body.\n2. Voice prompts: only tell you if you are connected.  Not battery level.

Some have criticized the sound quality, but I found it to be stellar with the Buds.  I own the LG-Tone and will definitely say that this device is a notch above in terms of build quality, range, and sound.  The only area the LG may have a leg up on this headset is in regards to having vibration, multi-sync with more than one device and that it can accommodate larger sized necks due to it's flexibility.  I'm a big guy and have about a 17.5 to 18 inch neck, and this fits me find.  I noticed that I do, ever so slightly, feel the Buds on my neck in the front, if I really think about it.  I believe that if I loose a few pounds then this would not be present at all.  It's really not a big deal and as I said, barely noticeable for me.  That being said, I notice it just as much as I notice the LG-Tone, due to the extra weight the Tone carries on the stems.  I much prefer the build quality and back loaded weight of the Buds, which puts the weight at the back of you rather than the front of your neck.  The problem this cause with the Tone is that when I bend over or lay back, they device would shift due to the weight and fall/slip off.  This doesn't seem to be a problem with the Buds, due to the weight being more balanced and even.\n\nThe sound as I stated is quality.  The settings right out of the box carried a LOT of bass.  Honestly they sound like really premium ear buds with excellent sound.  I never tried listening to them with the mid-sized ear buds that come pre-installed.  I immediately put on the larger ear buds (3 sizes come with it) and found that there was no problem for me at all.  I watched the two reviews by Clint Gibbs on YouTube and followed his advice regarding putting the appropriate buds in your ear.  I HIGHLY suggest you putting the ones that fit best in your ear on prior to first using.  Make sure the buds give a light seal in your ear when they are inserted.  This should not need to fit deep into your ear, nor feel like it is going to fall out.  The right fit forms a \"sound seal\" perfectly in your ear and feels very comfortable.\n\nWith regards to pairing, controls, and functionality, these are really easy to learn and will do everything that meets my needs.  Sync with my Galaxy Note 2 was quick and flawless.  The connection stays and it pics up any audio/sound coming from your device.  Some have mentioned that the lack of vibration is an issue for them.  I actually haven't seen this as a real problem, although I would like to see if Motorola adds the feature to future versions of the Buds.  That being said, they work just fine for calls and everyone I have spoken to so far has stated that call quality was excellent.  I have owned other Motorola BT headsets before and like them, this one is a winner in my book.

The bulk of the device is on the part that fits behind the ear so it isn't very noticable.  It fits rather securely.  I like the \"boom\" style mics as they seem to pick up your voice better.  The \"sound\" piece looks in photos like its supposed to fit into your ear canal, but it actually sits just on the outer \"lip\" of your ear canal.  If you're wearing over a long period of time, the pressure can cause some soreness on that outer portion of your ear canal.  The buttons are mixed.  The answer/end/voicedial button on the boom is nicely sized and well located.  It actuates with a typical microclick (like on a mouse button).  The power/volume control, however, is horrendously designed.  It is a multifunction button that rotates up, down (for volume control) and presses in (for power).  It is TINY and hard use.  I have always had a difficult time powering the device on or off because of it.\n\nFunction:\n\nIt functions well for an older, cheap bluetooth device.  Range is roughly 15-20 feet line-of-sight.  Throw in a wall and you are severely reduced.  Sound quality is decent.  I have no problems listening on the device and volume is adequate.  The boom mic works well in most cases.

The button on the end of the mic boom is awesome for answering and ending calls.  If your phone has voice-dialing, holding down that button will launch your phone's voice dialing feature.  The volume rocker was easy to use; however, pushing it in to mute the mic produced the same tone as swiveling the rocker to change the volume, so you never really knew if you had muted your call or just adjusted the volume.  They really should have had different tones associated with those functions, especially since it's two distinct functions in one control.  Range and battery life were all outstanding.  Charging is quick, and the status light is handy.  Pairing was a snap; worked first time.  It's comfortable enough to wear for long periods, and it's very unobtrusive.  Not so much that you'd forget it's there, but enough to leave on and not bug you.\n\nThis headset has only two downfalls.  One: no noise reduction circuitry.  The microphone on the headset works very well; unfortunately, too well if there's *any* sort of noise in the area -- another conversation, a TV twenty feet away, a barking dog in the next room -- were all as clearly heard by my caller as my own voice, prompting her to ask me to move to another room where it wasn't quite so loud.  And trying to use it in the car, forget it.  I was told that I was barely distinguishible from the noise of the car.\n\nTwo: The manual.  This is one of those manuals where they give you one small illustration and 327 different languages (actually, it's only 7, but it feels like 327) on each page, so the pairing instructions took up about 5 pages, but about half a napkin's worth of content.  That's a thoroughly annoying feature; so annoying to me that I skipped the manual altogether and went straight to the website to get the instructions all in one language.  That's significant enough to me to be a downfall.\n\nAll in all, this is a great entry-level Bluetooth headset, priced right for the \"value-conscious\" consumer.  But for anyone who expects superior quality conversations, rivaling those offered by your \"actual phone,\" I would pay more for a better quality headset with some noise-cancelling circuitry.  I suggest looking at the Jabra FreeSpeak BT250.

It's one step down from the v400.  So if you can afford it, get the v400 instead!  The v400 has a ton of included themes and photos, and more memory (5 MBs) compared to this phone, which is sort of \"bare bones\" (1.8mb).  Both have the same quality camera and photos, although the v400 has a better screen. Both phones can have .mp3's playing as ringtones.\n\nThe v220 has very clear sound quality, great screen and excellent battery life.  My only problem with it is that there is NO SUPPORT from motorola for a data link cable.  The V220 connects via a small USB plug, but you have to order the datalink software & drivers from motorola before you can use it (another fourty bucks! And Cingular didn't stock it, only Motorola does, on a very remote part of their site).  I got my software on a file-sharing program because I've NEVER heard of a company charging money just for DRIVERS!!\n\nAll-in-all I'm loving my new phone (I've had it for several weeks).  I've been able to get rid of my palm pilot because it holds 1,250 contacts (with the Simm Card).  One note - if you add your contacts to the phone's memory (as opposed to the Simm's) you will have to set the ringer for each contact or else it defaults to no ring).  The motorola software also allows you to sync to your Microsoft Outlook contacts and calendar, and it was truly easy to use!\n\nThis phone is a great way to feel like you've got tons of money, because it's basically just a \"baby\" version of the v400 (which retails for about $150 more usually).  It's a good buy, and on Amazon right now with their rebate, you actually get money BACK for buying the phone!\n\nIf you have any questions about the phone that I haven't answered here, feel free to AIM me at WinterGetsMe.

It opens to a small color screen and a traditional keypad lit by blue light. Features include a speaker phone (great for the car if you don't have your headphone attached), camera, voice-activated dialing, international capability, IM, web browsing, alarm, date book, calculator, as well as the more standard caller ID, address book, and call log information.  The camera is slow - don't expect to catch anything in motion - but adequate.\n\nThe worst feature is the ring tones, as it comes with very few (compare to Nokia's).  On top of that, the volume is not high enough to hear the phone from the bottom of my purse.  If you want a distinctive ring tone, you'll have to pay to download tones from your service provider.  Although the phone has a mini USB connector port to download your own music/tones and to upload pictures, you need to find a driver that will work on your computer.  Don't expect help on how to find one.  The Motorola site is useless, and my service provider salespeople didn't have a clue it was needed.  The thick manual that comes with the phone is barely helpful, as it shows key strokes to access features without explaining crucial information; for example, it tells you how to access new melodies without telling you how to actually accomplish the download.  In general, the manual looks helpful without actually being of use.\n\nAs of the writing of this review, the phone seems to be too new for electronic accessory companies to have come up with a non-brand auto charger and headset.  You'll have to pay your service provider rates if you want these.\n\nOn the plus side, the flip phone style makes it small enough to fit into my palm.  The sound is good, and the international capabilities (check with your plan) make it more versatile than some of its competitors.  I love that I can create my own wallpaper and screensaver with just a few intuitive key strokes.  Eventually, the sound features, with Motomixer and personalized ring tones, will also be great - as long as I find a driver.\n\nFor a relatively low-end camera phone, its performance is surprisingly good despite the nonexistent support.

This means that every year you can get a new phone, often at a great subisidized price if you choose to select a \"new\" contract.  You might need to give up your old numbers (unless you are switching betwewen the carriers) but for those who don't care it's a great way to try out lots of new phones at very little cost.  Keep this tip in mind when you are buying this phone.\n\nTo get the good news out first, one thing great about Verizon phones is that they all have great reception.  This more likely is due to Verizon installing more cell phone antennas everywhere than the phones themselves, but to the end user it's all the same.  As a travelling consultant, reception is the single most important aspect to look for in a phone.  When I am out in rural areas and a client wishes to speak to me, it's imperative that I am able to talk to the client without interruptions or static.  This is the part which this phone and Verizon excels at.\n\nSadly, the V710 does not excel in anything else compared to its peers.  As other posters have complained, the bluetooth functionality is limited because Verizon decided to disable file transfer capabilities.  That way Verizon can force the users to download ringtones and other goodies instead of people copying files from their computers via bluetooth.  The way to get around this is to get the 128MB transflash card, which I did buy.  This worked out great as I was able to transfer songs and music from my computer to the phone with no problems.\n\nSome other useful (if not standard) features in this phone include a standard 1 Megapixel camera (4x zoom), a video capture (which allows you to capture 15 sec clips with full sound, whoopie), speaker phone (a very nice feature which is missing from Samsung phones), and voice dialing (good feature if you drive and talk a lot, something which I find to be extremely annoying when others do it).\n\nNow onto the ugly part.  Motorolla continues to implement the annoying loud beep when the phone is low on batteries.  I don't know how to turn this off and embarassed myself over at a client's site because of this.  This is also one of the very few phones which does not come with a headset (Samsung, Nokia, even the Sidekick II packages give you this for free).  Even if you do get the headset, it comes with only 1 earbud so you cannot get stereo quality sounds which the mp3 should be able to give off.\n\nIn summary, if you are a casual user and reception is very important to you then get this phone or at the very least go for Verizon phones.  If you are looking for features (which are actually implemented well) to show off to friends then you should probably go for the Motorola Razor from Sprint, or maybe a Samsung or SonyEricson.  If you are looking for phone to do text messaging (especially AIM) and web browsing then be sure to get the SidekickII.  If you want a business phone for Outlook sync and messaging then go for one of the Blackberry phones.\n\nUpdate: I just found that there are in fact stereo headsets for this phone, it's just that Amazon does not carry them!  From Howardforums (the hardcore phone mod community) people are also complaining about the V710's new firmware which disables audio transfers from the TransFlash card onto the phone.  Yes, Verizon wants to make that extra buck from ringtones THAT badly.

I was blissfully unaware of the levels of EMF and this meter certainly fixes that.  I would have rated it 5 stars if there was a \"hold button\" that you press at the highest reading mark so that you can read the level after it was taken.  Even better would an automatic highest reading indicator that you could clear for each type of energy scan.  Nonetheless I like the meters flexibility in being able to scan electric and magnetic energy readings and I do recommend it.", "summary": "We have a lot of computer and electronic devices in our home and I feel better getting some idea of which devices and areas have", "unixReviewTime": 1425081600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2015", "reviewerID": "A38B3B480EIA7T", "asin": "B00050WQ1G", "reviewerName": "Euler Soto", "reviewText": "GREAT METER FOR EMF.", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1420329600}, {"overall": 3.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2014", "reviewerID": "A2E89RWOAITSBS", "asin": "B00050WQ1G", "reviewerName": "John Cheng", "reviewText": "This is not a device for measuring the radiation, it is meter for measuring the magnetic field.", "summary": "Three Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1419465600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "2", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2014", "reviewerID": "A10TZJ3SNARRG1", "asin": "B00050WQ1G", "reviewerName": "NC Family", "reviewText": "Great meter for measuring magnetic fields.

In short, this one seems to be a good one, and my wife and I recommend it.  We were looking at a house that was right next to large power lines and had heard mixed stories about whether they are dangerous or not for kids.  We wanted to check and this meter was a decent price, so we gave it a try.  It worked well, was easy to use, and helped us make an informed decision.  If you know you want to buy an EMF meter, this is one of the better ones.  I recommend this meter to others.\n\nLong version:\nWe were looking at buying a house very close to larger power lines.  Not the biggest high-voltage kinds, but not the normal lines either.  We read a lot of studies from Canada, the UK, the US, and from Asia, and some studies said there was a health risk for young kids from electro-magnetic fields of certain strengths.  But there were also studies that said there was no risk or, if there was a risk, it was very very small.  We looked at big studies, little studies, government studies, private studies, we couldn't find one consistent answer. Our home inspection companies did not have EMF meters, so we looked at a number of options to get a test.  Because of the disagreement in the reports, we decided to just buy a meter to test ourselves.\n\nThis meter, unlike many, has multiple sensors so you don't have to continuously spin it while using it.  Other meters that have just one sensor say in their instructions to do so.  If you spin it incorrectly, you could get an inaccurate reading.  We aren't experts in using these things, and we wanted an accurate reading, so we went with this meter.  We tested it in a hotel room, in a house, in the yard, by power lines, and by various electronics and other items.  The meter gave consistent readings for the items and places we tested.  It is easy to read and easy to use.  Based on our meter readings and the studies, we were able to make an informed decision about the house.\n\nBasically, the way the meter works is the dial at the bottom has different settings for different things you'd test for.  We were only testing for EMF from power lines, so we only used two of those settings.  Those EMF settings let you control which of the three lines you see on the screen are in use.  For example, if you set it to one of the settings (Magnetic 0-100), it will look for EMF and use the top line on the meter.  That line is for higher readings, and it measures between 0 and 100 milliguass (1 milligauss is equal to .1 microtesla if you're trying to measure in microtesla).  So if you have a strong magnetic field, you'd need to set the meter to 0-100 and look at the top line.\n\nIf you set it to \"magnetic 0-1,\" another EMF setting, you'd get a more precise reading using the middle line of the meter.  On the big meter setting (0-100), you might see that you have between 1 and 2 milligaus, but not know exactly what number.  But on the 0-3 setting, you could see if you have 1.2, 1.5, 1.7, etc.  For most residential/non-professional uses, you probably don't need to be that precise, but for people using this professionally, I suspect that setting would help more.\n\nWe also used the meter, like other reviewers, around various electronics in our home.  We were surprised to see that, if you put this in front of a microwave within a few feet, you'll go off the scale on even the 0-100 meter.  I read about other reviewers doing that and being startled.  There's nothing like seeing it yourself.  I'm not really a big worrier about EMF, but after seeing that with my own eyes, I don't stand by the microwave when it's in use.\n\nIn short, this seems to be a great meter.  It met our needs.

External magnetic fields that disrupt sensitive electronic instruments can be identified with the Tri-field meter, making it easier and more cost effective to apply expensive magnetic shielding materials such mu-metal judiciously.\n\nWhere this meter became particularly useful was identifying magnetic fields inside of a laboratory adjacent to a room housing large elevator drive motors. Traditional shielding doesn't isolate circuits from magnetic fields below 100 KHz. Hence, these slowly rotating magnets generated massive magnetic fields that interfered with our sensors.  With the Trifield meter, the source and intensity of the magnetic fields could be characterized.  This enabled the lab to move out of harm's way what equipment could actually be moved.  What instruments and sensors that were still too close to the source of the magnetic fields could then be properly be shielded with mu-metal magnetic shielding. Given that the cost of Mu-metal foil can range from $50 to $100 per square foot, the investment in the meter can easily pay for itself.\n\nThis meter doesn't appear to have changed much since it was introduced 15+ years ago.  It would be nice to have a more sophisticated readout and memory storage functions.  A moving needle is helpful for getting a sense of changes in field intensity.  Yet, it would be nice to have a min/max function that could be read in digital form.  Additionally, this device has no frequency measurement, which would also help characterize the fields in questions.  Understandably, such features would require more oscilloscope-like functions that would increase its price.\n\nIt is somewhat disconcerting that the meter's manufacturer appears to be marketing to hypochondriacs and ghost hunters.

I chose the 3100 model because I realized I don't have a lot of space on my cars dash to put a lot of displays.\n\nI ordered mine with not just a custom wiring harness for my 1998 Accord EX, but with a custom wiring harness which includes prewired mute configuration (quickconnectproducts dot com).  I was dreading having to run the wiring for power until I realized I didn't have too!!  The power is also automatically taken via the wiring harness from the power going to the radio.  I installed it myself in about 1 hour.\n\nThe Parrot has some thoughtful ergonomic design.  Very functional.  For example, when you turn your key ignition off while on a call, instead of going dead and dropping the call, it continues to to stay on and asks you if you would like to transfer the audio back to the phone!  How cool is that.\n\nAudio quality is great.  First, unlike my 2008 RAV4 factory bluetooth which is very good, the Parrot is FULL DUPLEX which means both of you can talk at the same time which allows much smoother conversations.  It has the magic DSP background noise elimination so callers don't hear the road noise.  All the echo is cancelled as well, and your voice is processed to remain strong and loud despite being distant from the microphone.  Callers tell me I sound like I am directly talking on the phone and not on a speaker phone.  The Parrot audio amp which sends sound to the car speakers does have a small amount of high frequency hiss/noise in the background; however this isn't a problem as you can only hear it when the engine is shut off.\n\nEven though the Parrot doesn't have an interface for your steering wheel controls (I don't have them anyway), you can still operate some of the key functions via voice recognition.  Because the Parrot voice recognition limits you to half a dozen voice commands, they actually work!\n\nThe 2-3 line display of the Parrot CK3100 is plenty of display for me.  Some users may not even need a model with a display.  The display indicates phone battery charge and cellular signal strength, although on my Palm Treo 700p with Verizon the cell signal strength is not accurate as displayed on the CK3100 display.\n\nMounting the display and microphone for these types of devices in a car is always a challenge.

The best assortment of actually useful mounting hardware I have seen.\n\nWhen talking on my cell phone while driving, I am aware that my attention is diverted.  I don't like it.

Compared to the original Sidekick, SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier, esp. the new thumb keyboard, but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks, requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.\n\nThe problem with the whole T-Mobile data service, though, is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data), it's even worse, and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens, SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience, esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g., when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).

Vincent", "reviewText": "We've had the Sidekick II for about two months.  Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value, I find it very awkward to use as a phone.  It doesn't have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to \"press 1 for English\", etc.  Very annoying.\n\nYou also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun.  Otherwise, all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra).  Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option.\n\nAnother gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter \"A\" has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.\n\nThe battery is built into the phone, so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example.\n\nInternet browsing is cool, but so slow you think it stopped working.  I think some of the fault is just the slow connection, but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display.\n\nOh, yeah.  Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site, then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.\n\nThe phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction.

For $20/month all you can eat data, this is a screaming deal.  I don't find the web surfing that useful (speed is about like a 28kbps dial-up connection) but for email it is superior to the Blackberry 957 I used a number of years ago.  The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great.  Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used.  The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger's servers.  I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident, but if that's a concern, limit what you leave on the server.\n\nDrawbacks are no bluetooth, no resident memory for email, pictures etc, no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.\n\nGreat things, great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry), intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity. Camera a nice feature, easy to email pics anywhere. A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email. The web and other stuff are \"OK\" but TMO data network will have to get faster and more WAP coded websites for content that is relevent for that to be a big reason to buy/use this device.\n\nI purchased through Danger's website total cost $0 after $200 instant discount and $100 in rebates. Worth a year's contract with TMO in my book.  Paying $49/mo for 3000 regional anytime minuets and $20/mo for all you can eat data (email, text messaging, etc, etc EVERYTHING DATA included).\n\nI would recommend this to anyone that really needs email and occaisional web service in addition to phone service.

This device is excellent. It will play audio attachments, display pdf files, graphics, attachments, and everything is mirrored on a secure web site so I can add large documents, notes, etc. for public speaking.\n\nI recently was caught off guard and asked to address a group at our facility and was able to browse right to the topic I needed as a springboard for my lecture.\n\nHint: Turn the graphics off in the browser to get faster page loads. This is especially handy when you need to get to the facts fast!\n\nThe speaker phone is very good. Much like a 2-way radio. Clarity is better than with the CSK. I use my phone in the car a lot and handle it like a \"CB mike\" or slip it into my shirt pocket and talk into the air.\n\nThe camera takes nice 640x480 pictures with options to take lower resolution shots if you plan on taking lots of pictures. I found the flash actually works better if you set it on \"low-light\" flash rather than the \"night\" setting. Give the camera a few seconds to adjust and the flash works much better. This especially good when doing backlit subjects.\n\nI like the fact that you can actually send pictures to another mailbox. (Unlike my son's camera phone which merely sends you to a web link.)\n\nI downloaded the Outlook software that sync's my phone to my Outlook contacts. Worked great after I actually read the DIRECTIONS! LOL\n\nI use my CSK2 for work, play, and mix a little of both.\n\nIf I have anything critical to say it is that the CSK2 can get sand or dirt in through the hinge. I took it to the beach and my nephew tossed a ball of wet beach sand on it. the grit managed to get in between the plastic screen and the display. This cracked the screen when just a slight pressure was put on the plastic screen. (T-mobile replaced it for free since the display screen cracked without the plastic cover screen being cracked. Very understanding of them!)\n\nCombined with T-Mobile's features I can use my cell phone to receive faxes, view assorted files, create, send, and view jpg's, chat on AOL, Chat on Yahoo, buy and sell on Amazon!!!! etc. I have purchased a number of books on Amazon while sitting by our lake.\n\nOne more peeve: Snoop Dog makes a poor spokesman.

J. Simicich", "reviewText": "I give it five stars - despite some technical problems:\n\nYou can send and receive vcfs in e-mail attachments - but you can't always file them when you receive them. They are rendered well enough such that you can move the material manually.  This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory, and otherwise are formatted correctly, they will get taken. But, some applications, for example, evolution, that great Linux e-mail application, does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename, so the sidekick will not file evolution's vcards (unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type).\n\nRather than picking the name of the vcard for import out of the vcard's formatting, the sidekick uses the filename. This might mean that it would be simply to pass garbage through the vcf interface, so be careful.\n\nYou can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs, but you can't click on them. You can't click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself, then click on the URLs out of the mail, where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.\n\nThe documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser. You might say, \"With a regular browser, why would I care about a WAP browser?\" - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number, WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer, according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can't browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site).  So you can't browse them at all from the phone.\n\nThat is about it.  Most of the rest is great. I moved my Nextel data over by exporting the data from the Nextel site, and, in openoffice, I rearranged the column names to match what would have been exported from Outlook Express, and then imported.  Oh, yes, I also built names with a formula. Saved it as a comma file, just like Outlook had, and, poof, in about a minute, a couple hundred phone numbers, addresses, and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone.  I could have mailed vcfs for the 70-80 contacts that I was using, but that didn't work.\n\nI've resisted all the games (I want MINESWEEPER - yes, I know it is lame).  I might have to drop $4 for solitare.\n\nI did drop $10 for the terminal program, and it has already become helpful - the terminal program is wonderful for something on such a tiny device. I can check out servers by connecting to them in raw mode, by port. I can ssh, securely, to my server. There are lots of disconnects, mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes, but a program available in Linux called \"screen\" allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them, see their output, get status, and all that stuff. I can even get on IRC using a character mode IRC client.\n\nSomeone called me to fix something on a weekend - it was something I could have fixed in 5 minutes on a real terminal, it took eight on the tiny terminal. In many ways, emacs seems to work better than vi does in character mode, but they both work.\n\nOne secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU (from Microsoft if you have pro). Command line only, sorry.\n\nTo echo the comments about the AIM client, which is utterly reliable vs. the yahoo client, which drops and reconnects all the time, is probably worthwhile.\n\nThe documentation suggests that you surf with graphics off for speed. But many buttons are graphical and, unlike every other character or graphics off browser that simply displays the alt text, or, if there is none, \"[IMAGE]\", the button completely goes away, which means that you can't access what the button points to. This essentially means that you have to leave graphics on to surf.\n\nOccasionally, web sites are mis-represented - on eBay, for example, there is an extra entry bubble generated between the search text bubble and the putton you push - if you enter text there (which seems the right place) searches don't work.\n\nDespite all these niggling problems, and t-mobile's hapless tech support, I am still giving this device five stars. The astounding thing about a poker playing dog is not that it wags its tail when it has a good hand, but that it can tell that it has a good hand at all.\n\nThe difference between getting text directions and being able to pull up a map of the area you are in as you drive down the road is wonderful - and then javascript stops you from being able to pull up a turn by turn map as you need it.\n\nI did not expect to have something in my hand that would allow me to log in to my system using ssh, browse at all, much less pull up mapquest maps.", "summary": "The Sidekick II does Almost everything....", "unixReviewTime": 1102896000}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "19", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2004", "reviewerID": "A2DU1MB894LIAQ", "asin": "B00063DKVC", "reviewerName": "Ernie Odom", "reviewText": "Love everything except... my reception is poor.

In fact, if Samsung/Sprint had released the i550 (SD memory slot, faster, etc.) I would have never considered the Treo 650.  So, let's talk about the positives of the 650:\n\nCamera w/movies is nice.  Memory card slot is nice.  It's fast. Bluetooth sync with my Mac Powerbook is awesome - no more plugging up cables to HotSync! Handfree in the Prius works great. Having a PalmOS 5 based machine gives a more powerful web browser that can view more sites. Higher rez screen is nice.\n\nOn the downside, the lack of graffiti would be okay if this keyboard was as good as the one in the old Motorola PageWriter, but instead, it's as small as they could make it, requiring shift-keys to get to slashes, @ symbols, numbers, etc. A real hassel and even though I could blaze on the PageWriter, I've been reduced to about half the speed on this keyboard due to all the extra work.  Having software-graffiti would have been nice, and the third-party add-on \"write on screen\" apps are okay, but not as accurate as what my 6035 or i500 had.\n\nNo voice recognition at all, but for $20 you can get a program that is awesome and doesn't have to be trained.  \"Call 5 5 5 1 2 1 2\" and it does.  \"Call Bob Tompson Mobile\" and it matches it to the address book -- no training, beyond numbers. VERY NICE.\n\nBattery life is so-so.  You have to charge it each day if you use the 'net much. i500 was poor, too, but better than this.  The 6035 I could use for almost a week without charging it!  (6035 and i500 had analog modes, too, while the 650 is digital only.)\n\nSo, it's okay, I'm okay with it, it crashes/reboots randomly all the time, but ... there's really no other option on Sprint.\n\nI would have taken a flip phone over this huge brick phone in a heartbeat...

I have used the T-Mobile Sidekick, the AT&T Motorola MPX, a Nextel Blackberry, a Samsung i600, and even an older style Treo in the form of the Treo 300. And out of every smart device I have ever used, the Treo 600 and 650 are 1000 times better then any of them!\n\n1# The Treo's have large color screens with full keyboards, but are still small enough to fit in your pocket.\n\n2# The battery life is insanely long! Both of the new Treo's claim four to five hours talk time, I have found even longer. I often lay in my bed at night surfing the web for hours and hours, and by the time I am ready to go to sleep, my Treo 600 and 650 still have enough battery life to go a few more rounds.\n\n3# Because the Treo's are so popular the prices for accessories, software, add-on's, ect are Much cheaper then those for the other types of smart devices on the market. There is even talk by Palmone to start using Linux as the Palmsource software core, so there will be even more software available. And because Linux is open source, the phones will eventually be cheaper then those running the Microsoft Pocket PC. With the added bonus of the dependability of Linux!\n\n4# Because the Treo's are of the Candy-Bar style design, they are much easier to talk on. Because there is no flip, or antenna to fumble with.\n\n5# There is a software lancher called \"ZLauncher\" which has many features for your Treo's software interface. One of which allows you to see the exact level of signal strength. By using this tool you can so how much better the Treo's antenna and related components work, compared to any other phone on the market. I get a great signal with Sprint, but with Sprint and my Treo, my service is even better! I get signals with my Treo in places where my Sanyo and LG did not. In fact, I get better signal strength with my Treo, then my friends get with their phones!\n\n6# Palmone has a patent on a new design of smart device that they are working to bring to the market. A design nothing like the designs currently available. A PDA phone that will be thinner and still able to have a large full color screen and keyboard. SO the next generation of Treo's will be even better!\n\nThe only downfall to the Palmone Treo's today, is price. That is because they are still new to the PDA phone market. Once they start making more and more phones, the prices will come down. And once they restructure their PDA manufacturing and company purpose in general, the prices will come down. I don't normally write reviews on phones, because I used to be a Die-Hard Motorola phone fan, and I guess still am. But if Palmone keeps making phones this perfect, then I will only buy their phones for the rest of my life! I can not say enough good things about these phones!

And that little keyboard lites up in bright blue and white is very easy to read. Thanks to the faster processor, the program loads a lot faster.\n\nHowever, I am still looking for the built-in WiFi, and the bluetooth does not take voice command; reboot is not as easy as Treo 600. I do not notice the boot up being slow because I rarely have to. However, I did notice that it takes up more internal memory and thus make the available ram less than 10MB the first time I turned it on. (Palm is doing a flash upgrade to fix this, so I heard.) With an SD card, I put a bunch of application on it to get around this until it get fixed.

But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations.  It goes totally dead with my hard drives, telling me that they're drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them. But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive, it remains dead, dark and non-communicative.  It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports.  That's fine, but not what I need with my 1TB (and bigger) hard drives, which until now had been showing on my computer's desktop with each start-up.  I'm about to call a rep in order to get an idea of what's going on and whether there's a fix (could it be Apple's latest update to OSX?  I'll be back pending further info.]\n\nI realized I needed a 7-port hub and checked out the D-Link, Kensington, Belkin--the usual suspects.  Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender, looking more like a jukebox in Amazon's picture than a hub.  I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive (though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates, a free flylight, and other sweeteners). Now that I'm looking at the CyberPower USB port \"in person,\" I can provide a few initial impressions:\n\n1.  It's a lot smaller than the picture might imply.  Compactness is nice, but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.\n2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you've got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.\n3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer's credit, it's one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I've seen.)\n4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.\n5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device--providing you go for the vertical look.  If I were to suggest one design improvement, it would be to \"fatten up\" the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position.  Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs, even the most space-devouring ones.  Biggest \"gripe\": the vertical design is not real stable.  The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit.  If I had to do it over, I'd look at the heavy, dome-shaped Kensington.\n\n[Revaluation after almost 3 years: I tried the Kensington. It was no more stable but less reliable. So I returned to the CyberPower, but without the base or vertical position.  I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine, with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear, one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac, and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub.  Absolutely no problems.  This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it's so good.  Should it ever fail, I doubt there's any other hub available that could surpass it. Forget the \"cuteness\" factor; this thing is all business.]\n\n[4 years later: This \"off brand\" hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington \"round mound\" have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I've had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.]", "summary": "4 years of flawless performance (I even bought another for my wife)--until now.", "unixReviewTime": 1200528000}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "5", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2008", "reviewerID": "A1F9Z42CFF9IAY", "asin": "B0006TIA8Y", "style": {"Model:": " 7-Port", "Package Type:": " Standard Packaging"}, "reviewerName": "phototristan ", "reviewText": "This is a really nice USB 2.0 hub.

The product is recommended.\n\nThe only hitch is the charging system. The headset slides into a circular disc that has a 'crescent' shaped slot built into it to accept the headset. The wire that plugs into the wall for power then plugs into the disc at the other end.  You have to have both items, then, to charge it. I cannot figure out why the charger simply isn't a one-part solution.\n\nAnd, from what I can discover, you cannot buy replacement/extra discs. This means that when you travel you have to unplug and pack both parts ... and that you cannot have a second charging solution set-up in the office or in the travel kit.

The headset, which I purchased online, arrived with no instructions, but did include the charger, charger cord, belt hook, and several earbuds. A quick search online discovered the manual and pairing was accomplished shortly thereafter. All functions of the headset, including vibrating ring and voice dial, work with my phone. Sound quality is generally excellent -- it's at least as good as the phone's earpiece. All bets are off if you're out in the wind or driving with the window down, precisely the same conditions under which you can't hear the phone's own earpiece either. External noise such as a crowded restaurant doesn't seem to be a problem for my combination of phone and headset. The short boom mike seems to be acceptable -- nobody has complained they can't hear me. In fact, I can talk pretty softly under most circumstances and be heard just fine. External noise such as a crowded restaurant doesn't seem to be a problem for my combination of phone and headset. The battery is advertised to last a long time and it does. I haven't measured any run-down times, but the headset needs to be charged less often than the phone, which with bluetooth on needs a charge every couple days. The headset is light and, for me, comfortable; after wearing it 12 hours a day for the first several days I forget it is there. The headset is reversable by the simple expedient of rotating the earbud. The dorsal sping of the headset contains one button and one rocker switch. Because of the location of the switches they do not need reversing. The rocker controls volume up and down; the button combines on/off and answer/hang-up. Press the button to answer or hangup, hold for about 5 seconds to turn off/on. My phone hangs up when the other party disconnects and conveniently, so does the headset. The headset slips into the charging cradle like a knife into a holster. An accessory clip attaches to the charging cradle so you can hang the cradle (unplugged, of course) on your belt or waistband to carry the headset when it's not being worn. With practice, the headset can be put on with one hand. There is no provision for charging in an automobile, which would be inconvenient were battery not so long-lasting. Just pop the headset into the charger in the evening and you're good for the next day. On an extended trip the charging cord and cradle must accompany the traveler.  Other than the lack of a car adapter, which can be remedied aftermarket, my only complaint is that the headset is somewhat wobbly on my ear and the ear bud occasionally works itself away from my ear canal. This is not always immediately apparent until a call is made/received. This is aggravaated by the fact that there is no way to adjust the headset, it being constructed of a plastic shell with a soft lining against the ear. Even the flexible shaft holding the ear bud does not adjust side to side.  The headset is rated for up to 30 meters; this does not include walls or other obstructions. Jabra recommends you wear the headset on the same side that you carry your phone. Practice proves this. Lack of adjustability aside, this is a good headset with outstanding battery life.

It has been an easy to operate phone. There are a few minor flaws that I've found which you may want to consider prior to making a purchase decision.\n\nPROS\n\n-Solid reception - seems to hold calls pretty well - have not experienced unexpected call drops.\n\n-As near as I can tell people are hearing my calls clearly\n\n-Easy to text message with predictive entry - very clear interface and helpful completion of words\n\n-While on T-Mobile you can be browsing the web and also receive an incoming voice call (though you cannot continue to browse - the key is that it doesn't send people to your Voicemail). I believe this is a function of the GSM technology that T-Mobile and Cingular operate under.\n\nCONS\n\n-Earpiece volume is low - you'll have difficulty using this in noisy environments.\n\n-Not EDGE (high speed Internet) capable\n\n-If there is a way to have multiple contact info (home, business, cell, email) for one address book entry - I haven't found it. Instead I have awkwardly had to setup multiple address entries (how 1980's).\n\n-The phone offers a Bluetooth connection - and there should be a standard keypress to turn the BT on and off. Instead you have to create a shortcut or re-map one of the \"smart\" keys to do the task.\n\n-It should be easier to change ring styles - most phones allow you to change the style to vibrate right from the volume buttons or a key press - the V330 supports this (kinda) but you have to use the up/down volume and then a smart key to select. The extra steps are tedious when you are trying to go into a store or movie theater and want to mute the phone.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nI'd purchase this phone again for T-Mobile. I considered other phones before making this purchase and the overall features (including the ability to use Bluetooth)are what attracted me to the V330.\n\nThe requirement to list multiple names in the phone book is really odd and it might be that I just haven't found the \"secret\". The phone doesn't come with any type of detailed user manual so you have to go online and look at a PDF to get the information. So far I have not uncovered any secret.

Whereas both T-Mobile and Cingular operate on GSM frequencies and therefore can offer world phones, Cingular operates on the 850 and T-Mobile on 900. They allow each other to use their frequencies for instances where they don't provide a needed frequency... provided you device is equipped w/ both 850 & 900 mhz as is the Motorola V330.\n\nHow is T-Mobile?

This phone has the following pros and cons (IMHO):\n\nPROS:\n------\n1.  Bluetooth: Amazing feature which allows you to download all the pictures and videos from the phone apart from ofcourse the hands-free option. The bluetooth features included are File Transfer, Dial-up Networking etc.\n\n2.  Speakerphone: The speaker on this phone is of a real good quality. Of course the quality also depends on the signal strength.\n\n3.  External Display: Well light for digital time display, signal strength, battery life and bluetooth indicator. How much more can we ask of an external display?\n\n4.  Keypad: Well organized, decent color schemes, ergonomically designed and everything in its place. Some people whine about the T-Mobile logo but its no bother for me.\n\n5.  Software: I have always liked the software on motorola phones. Good amount of choice in ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers with download options too. The networking and connectivity is great and office tools (calendar, calculator etc.) live upto expectations. The only flaw in the phone book (as one reviewer pointed out) is the lack of categories (home, work, mobile etc.)\n\nCONS:\n------\n1. Dimensions: It is a bulky phone which requires a belt clip if you want to save yourself the embarassment of a bulb shaped pocket. If you don't want to wear a clip I'd suggest the RAZR for a few $$$ more.\n\n2.  Weight: It is certainly one of the heavier phones in the market. So if you are moving from a lighter instrument you might want to consider this issue.\n\n3.  Display: The display screen has the magical powers of going black when the display light goes out (default is 20sec but I had to set it to 60sec to work with bluetooth). Ofcourse by pressing any key it will get back on.\n\n4.  Antenna: Considering the fact that this phone is heavy and bulky the MOT guys could have shown some mercy on the size of the antenna. It could have been more like the antenna you would find on a T722i.\n\n5.  Camera: It's not the best resolution but would work if you are not looking to make a photography career by using the camera on this phone.\n\nI have been researching cell phones for 2 months now.

Comments like, \"doesn't hold a charge\" or \"it doesn't let you know when to recharge the batteries\" are totally false!

You say ...home or ...mobile.  The duplex sound is incredible and the volume is fully adjustable on the unit as well from your phone.

As for phone usage, I am not a power user but I do use it several times a day in short conversations.\n\nThe Palm Treo 650 has been awesome, better than I expected, and is not making it very difficult for me to let go of paper and pen.

There's a plethora of features to learn but that's part of the fun, isn't it? I got this phone unlocked so I use it on T-Mobile.\n\nSince I am not a business professional, I cannot speak for the functionality from that perspective but as young professional who loves to text message, constantly check email (I got Gmail POP to work in 2 minutes flat), use the phone, and obsessive-compulsively check daily plans, weekly timetables, etc. as well as write several notes-to-self, to-do lists, and shopping lists, this Treo is awesome.

As there as tons of things to find out about this Treo, I will just conclude with the highlights of the good and bad that I've found:\n\nGOOD:\n\n1. Good look, good feel (just get a case or sleeve so it stays shiny and new).\n\n2. Screen and colors are beautiful.\n\n3. Call quality is good and clear, no issues with volume.\n\n4.

Any extra applications or help you need is probably already on the internet.\n\n10. Bluetooth syncs well with my Mac's Bluetooth, transferring pictures and songs is soo easy.\n\n11. Lots of customizing options.\n\nNOT SO GOOD:\n\n1. Wish Palm would come out with a different, more detailed \"Month View,\" rather than those colored boxes/blocks representing your events.\n\n2. Wish the camera could have been a 1.3mp camera or higher.\n\n3. Keypad is still kind of cramped.\n\nOverall, this Treo 650 has been good to me.

I switched to BlackBerry two years ago (7290) and I've enjoyed using it except for the very, very basic screen. I assume that's how they get such remarkable battery life. But, I've had to switch from the BB for work reasons and I'm very happily using Palm again. My last Palm was a Palm Vx and it's still alive and kicking after many, many years.\n\nThe Treo 650's screen is really amazing. And, I've read the older reviews about the Treo 650 and the frequent resetting issue. I was certainly concerned and ready to send it back if I had problems (Cingular gives you 30 days to try it out). So far only one reset in two weeks with the Palm - honestly, I had to reset the BlackBerry constantly so I'm not sure I'd notice the difference. And, the BB resets are particularly annoying because they would happen at the start of answering incoming calls and then literally take 5-8 minutes to reset and let me use it again. I'm not sure why it took so long - I did have a big address book. The Palm reset only took 30 seconds.\n\nBut, here's where Treo shines: screen graphics, photos, mp3s and videos. I can put 2-4 movies on a 2GB SD card, pop into the Palm and carry around some convenient entertainment. One little feature that really impressed me was the ability to display the screen vertically (it's longer that way). With letterbox movies it really increases the size of the video and exceeds the size of videos on my Zen Vision 30GB screen. And, the videos really look incredible.\n\nAnd, of course, there's a ton of free software out there for the Palm. So far, I've only downloaded TCPMP for the movies. The included RealPlayer is very impressive - you're ready to listen to mp3s right out of the box.\n\nFinal note: I've used the Palm Desktop for PIM stuff (contacts, calendar, to do's) off and on for years and I'm still impressed with it's features and easy/quick navigation. They've always been ahead of the pack - I know many of the newer phones come with similar PIM software so your PC can talk to your new phone but aside from BlackBerry no one else is even in the ballpark.\n\nYou can manage photos in there as well and even add photos to your address book so once you've synced up your incoming calls display a picture of the caller.

When smartphones were first introduced, I bucked the trend of combining the two thinking that as often as I use my cell phone and my pda, if I bought one that integrated both I would wear it out twice as fast.  And in my humble opinion, it was a valid reason because back then, the original phone/pda's were impossibly large.  Well I have finally become a convert.\n\nI spent a great deal of time researching Blackberry's vs. the Treo's vs. Pocket PC's and came VERY close to grabbing a T-Mobile Dash (which I still believe is the all-around smallest model availabe as I write this, or at least it SEEMED to be), but I finally settled with the trusted Palm OS platform (one that I have become VERY familiar with over the years using pda's for quite some time now).  When I set out to get one, I really had my heart set on the Treo 680...but as I read the reviews for them, one thing kept creeping in to almost all the reviews: battery life was terrible.  With that aside, quite a few of the reviewers mentioned that all things considered, they were more happy with their old 650.  I saw this on so MANY reviews that I began to think twice.  Then I noticed that the 700p was a more beefed up version of the 650, and began to consider it as well.  Unfortunately as I write this, it isn't available with Alltell service where I am (it will, but nobody can give me a target date, and dang it, I am too impatient to wait...) so I am right back with the 650.  It took a while before Palm was able to knock enough of the bugs out of the 650 that I felt like buying one would be worth it...and I am discovering more than a few bugs have been associated with both the 680 & 700p, so no matter HOW much time I spend considering upgrading to a newer model, I find compelling reasons to go right back to the Old School 650.\n\nReason #1 to go with it: Since it is no longer available at Palm's Official website, and with the newer models coming out, chances are you can find some pretty sweet deals on the older 650.\nReason #2: Virtually ALL of the problems originally associated with the 650 have been eliminated.

Easier than ever with the 650 (that was one major plus over most of the Pocket PC's and ALL of the Blackberrys -- sure you can VIEW some of these documents, but you cannot EDIT them, too).\nReason #3: No matter HOW convenient the pda, I found it next to impossible to give up a touch-screen's amazing versatility and the ease with which you can use it to edit things and connect on websites.\n\nOne more important item to factor in when considering buying a 650: With the popularity with ever increasing wireless downloading speeds, I was afraid that the slower Treo would make internet surfing next to impossible because of the archaic speeds with which you are forced to endure.  I was VERY pleastantly surprised that downloading web pages did not take as long as I was at first expecting.  I have to tell you, after experimenting with the supposedly MUCH faster 700p with another online carrier than the one I was using (I won't say which, but they really did their best to tell me the 650 was slower than a dial-up modem from 1985), anyway, the 650 was only SLIGHTLY slower than this screaming fast 700p or the 700w.  I figured that was something I could live with to be honest.  Hey, it's a tiny hand-held device that allows me to send and receive email and surf the web...I'm still amazed that something like this exists at ALL to be honest with you...so downloading speed is still secondary in my opinion.  If speed really IS on your list of absolutes, maybe you ought to move up to something else...but keep in mind, it is only BARELY faster than what I experienced first hand.\n\nOne more thing: the screen is amazing.  There are only so many ways to say WOW.  If you are considering buying a Palm that runs Windows Mobile, you ought to know that the screen clarity is almost reduced by HALF.  This apparently has something to do with Window's OS, and seriously put my decision to buy one on the back burner.\n\nSure there are things that a smartphone cannot as yet do without some difficulty or impossibility...but that is the same with ALL current models.  Do some SERIOUS research into what you want vs. what you NEED and make an informed decision only AFTER you have had the chance to go into a store and test a specific model PERSONALLY.  Do that and no matter WHAT you decide on, you will most likely be happy.  So far, I know I am VERY satisfied with my choice.  Good luck on yours.\n\n***UPDATE***\n\nI opted not to get a Bluetooth hands-free device -- at first.  Originally I would see people walking around with these Lt. Uhura type thingy's sticking out of their ears and I couldn't help but wonder how lazy people are that they cannot raise their hand up to their head while walking around simply to talk on the phone.  For the most part I STILL feel this way, but I decided to buy a Bluetooth hands-free headset for while I am driving.  I cannot afford to miss calls, and being in radio, when not at work or home I can be found in my car monitoring the radio virtually 100% of the time and unfortunately this means I sometimes cannot hear the ringer.  The tethered device that came with the phone is certainly loud enough, but simply did not fit my ear (it kept falling out).  I bought a replacement that came with a variable size adapter and yet while it FIT better, the sound was almost impossible to hear (the worst I have ever experienced, actually).  So I took the plunge knowing full-well that the Palm Treo has a somewhat problematic history using these devices...so I made sure that I had an iron-clad return policy in place and jumped in.  It took me no more than a minute to configure my head-set and I went ahead and made a test call which had more than enough volume -- in fact it had plenty to spare.  All in all I am VERY satisfied with the performance. (I bought a Keycera Bluetooth, if that means anything)\n\nOne additional item that requires mentioning: I currently have call-waiting as a service with my Treo and yet I have missed at least 3 calls (that I know of).  This particular feature does not seem to be supported by the 650...and IF it is, I have yet to discover any useful info regarding the problem, whether online or in the bible-sized instruction manual.  I will keep looking and IF I find a solution I will quickly report it here asap.  Just one more thing to think about.  Otherwise, I am amazingly satisfied with my Treo otherwise.  The ONLY thing I wish (other than user-friendly call-waiting) is faster downloads while online.  That is supposedly possible with the newer models using EVDO and yet the 700p I tested failed to work only slightly faster than my 650.  Maybe it was the network -- but not according to them (no surprise there).

With the release of the next generation of Treos drmatically forcing down the price of the 650 I decided to take a chance. After a week of fairly active use I have to say that I am extremely pleased with my new Treo. I bought my new unlocked (Cingular branded) Treo online. The phone clarity is as good as any mobile phone that I have owned. I have not had any dropped calls. The browswer and e-mail client that came loaded on my Treo work well. I live in a country where the fastest mobile data connection is still GPRS/EDGE, so my Tro 650 is just right. I easily synced my Treo with my MacBook with no problems.

I love this thing.  It's perfect for me and my needs--personally, as well as in business.\n\n-New batteries and accessories are and will be available for years following your purchase, which means this has it all over other cell phones.\n\n-When you upgrade, all your data is transferrable even if you completely change carriers.\n\n-One program I added for instance is basically Google Earth--in my pocket!  And with memory cards in the gigabytes, I can add any and as much functionality as I care to have--plus store all my rediculous photos and other nonsense without worrying about running out of space.\n\n-I'll be using this as my mp3 player, and it's a camera that will be there even when I wouldn't have thought to bring one.\n\n-It holds all my appointments, vital information, etc . . . .\n\n-It has advantages over the super Japanese cell phones and system in that I can take longer movies and send them by regular e-mail.\n\n-When negotiating business over lunch or golf, where it would be a weak hand to bring a stack of papers or notes, you can input and look up information as need be in this device you would be expected to carry instead.\n\n-Add that I can basically use as many e-mail accounts on it as I like.\n\nThis basically negates whatever need I had to carry a laptop unless I'm on an extended business trip.\n\nThis is truly a computer with internet access in my pocket.  It can do all the same basic stuff a desktop computer can do.\n\nI'm only taking one star away because there are now later models even more capable, and if you're considering buying the 650 you might as well get it with faster internet access.\n\nNote that friends of mine with the 700w as opposed to the 700p say they miss the Palm native software and some have said they'll switch to the 700p to get it--so it's something to consider if you're thinking of going a step above the 650.\n\nLastly, though I do find this increadibly handy, I don't know that it's worth the asking price that's usually listed.  If a cell phone of any kind is connected to a service, the most it should cost the customer is $200 with a service contract.  There's really no excuse for charging people $500 for any phone (and I wouldn't have bought mine if it didn't cost me exactly $75 used).  They're selling you a service and making you sign a contract that they'll charge you big time for breaking, so they should take the additional expense when it comes to equiptment for for accessing services they're going to charge you or your company through the nose for anyway.\n\nCingular is currently selling these for $45 with a service contract, and I would take that deal if I weren't able to get mine for a reasonable price.  Conversely, I'd rather not have one issued by my company because that would leave me not a moment's privacy (people I have important business with know when it's appropriate to reach me by means other than my office phone or e-mail, and when it's not.)", "summary": "An increadibly all inclusive device for people who need a lot but don't want to carry a lot.", "unixReviewTime": 1160870400}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "183", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2006", "reviewerID": "A1ULPGDCSX8XUH", "asin": "B000982UY2", "reviewerName": "Jeantet Fields", "reviewText": "I have owned a Treo 650 on and off and on again since this model came out.  Initially, I was extremely frustrated by the phone's telephone performance and its lack of stability.  Frequent reboots, freezes and dropped calls made it difficult to appreciate the phone.  I ended up getting rid of it and relying on a separate palm and cell phone.  Over time, PalmOne has released firmware updates (the phone's operating system) that have made the phone very stable.  The improvements we so significant that they actually won me back.  This review is for the GSM Treo 650.\n\nA word about Carriers: I only use GSM because I travel abroad frequently - this limits me to Cingular and Tmobile.  I have used both, and I have found that Cingular's network coverage is more complete, especially in rural areas, but Tmobile's network sounds better.  It's a tradeoff - with Tmobile, you'll drop the call more often, but with Cingular you'll say \"what?\" more often.  Their coverage is about equal in big cities and along major highways.  International roaming is less expensive with Tmobile, plus Cingular has a few hurdles in place that prevent you from enabling international roaming on your account if you've been with them for less than 6 months.  Verizon and Sprint use a cellular technology that is US-only, and therefore no good for using your phone abroad.\n\nHere are the phone's pros: in your pocket, you have your address book, datebook, notes, e-mail, low-res still and video camera, a very nice sms interface that threads sms exchanges by contact, a web browser, and an mp3 player.  The QWERTY keyboard makes typing much faster than a standard phone.  The interface is unique and you will need a little time to get used to it, but once you do you will be as efficient at quick-dialing and keeping up with daily use as on any other phone.  Also, this phone is a quad-band GSM which means that it will work very well abroad, unlike the more common tri-band GSM phones, which don't perform as well.  (Remember, if you get a Treo Smartphone from Verizon or Sprint, it will not work abroad.)  The screen on the Palm version is brilliant.  The Windows version is not as sharp - a limitation imposed by the operating system.  Also, GSM technology uses \"SIM\" cards, which means you can simply change out the \"SIM\" and use your phone on another network or another phone number, either domestically or while abroad.  (You might have a phone locked onto a carrier's network until your contract commitment is complete, but that's something you can sort out on your own).\n\nHere are the phone's cons: I said \"in your pocket\" because if you mount this thing on your belt, the bulge may force you to make alterations on your sport jacket.  Also, in an age of identity theft and information security, you should think long and hard about just how much information is in there.  Believe me, the phone quickly becomes a place to store passwords, account information, customer information, etc.  Consider how you will feel if you leave it in a restaurant, or if it's stolen.\n\nHere are lesser cons that can be worked around: The beauty of these palm phones is that they're so popular; other people have had whatever problem you might encounter, and they've written software to address / fix / work around the issue.  For example, I found that the phone's volume is not loud enough.  There is 3rd party volume software to fix that, as well as software that allows you to use the phone as a Bluetooth modem for your computer.  Some software is freeware, some is shareware, and some is for purchase.  The key is that there are so many forums and resources on the Internet that you can search around and find the answers that you need, and the phone allows you to install and uninstall with as much ease as with your home PC.\n\nThoughts about newer Treo phones:  The 650 now costs a little less because the Treo 700w and 700p have come out.  This is a good thing, because I don't see the 700 having any new features that make the upgrade a \"must\".  Other than a slightly redesigned appearance and interface, and higher resolution camera, the phone's features are basically identical.  Also, as of the Summer 2006, the Treo 700 is only available on CDMA networks.  The Treo folks have staggered the release of GSM and CDMA models to give the all carriers a turn at exclusivity.\n\nLooking to the future, there is speculation that the next generation Treo phone will be a GSM, it will be thinner, lighter, and the antenna will be internal - basically, it will more resemble a blackberry on the outside.  These are much sought after features by Treo users.  Maybe I'll upgrade then.\n\nIn conclusion, only 4 stars for this phone because the product wasn't ready for market when they released it.  It's much better now; if they had initially released the current product, I would have given it 5 stars.  I hope my perspective helps you with your decision.\n\nUPDATE - Jan 08, 2007: the Treo750 (windows mobile) has come out in the UK with Vodafone, and here in the USA, the Treo680 (Palm OS) has been announced with Cingular.  In forums on the internet, people have reported that the new 680 addresses many wish-list items for the Treo faithful: slighly thinner (a modest few millimeters), internal antenna, better keyboard, volume-too-low issue \"sort of\" resolved, better mp3 player (pTunes instead of Real), more memory, improved phone interface, EDGE instead of GPRS to double the data speed.  Unfortunately, the camera has the same resolution (640x480) and the few millimeters thinner have meant a thinner battery.  Treo 680 owners complain of poor battery life (1 day or significantly less for power users).\n\nAs of Thanksgiving, every vendor pre-selling the Treo 680 was sold out (including Amazon).  This tells me two things: many Treo users are looking to upgrade immediately by choice, not out of necessity.  As a result, the market should be flooded with inexpensive used Treo650s, and no doubt merchants with 650 inventory will probably sell them inexpensively enough for people who have been priced out of the smartphone market to get their hands on one.\n\nPalm says the 680 is targeted to the every day person, not the power user.  I suppose that means in a year we should expect another more expensive model that will be what the 680 should have been.  I feel that Palm is releasing new models in a very slow and calculated manner in order to drive consumer spending.\n\nMy recommendation: if you want a Treo, go with the 650.  With an extended battery a power user (bluetooth, e-mail, etc.) can go 2 days between charges or 3 days with normal usage.  Look for it online.\n\nThe smartphone market has become very crowded with the slim Motorola Q (windows), the comparably sized and feature-rich Nokia E61 (legendary stability of Symbian OS), friendlier and proven Blackberry models, the Samsung blackjack (windows), and lately the MDA (windows) is getting rave reviews with all the features you wish you could have, including Wi-Fi.\n\nThe Treo does a lot - it probably has the best SMS interface on the market, but the rest is just ok.  For example, the mp3 player works, but not as good as a dedicated mp3 player like an iRiver or iPod.  The e-mail application works, but the IMAP implementation is poor, and POP3 performance is inconsistent re: leaving or deleting messages from the server.  If you want a good e-mail application on the Treo, you'll have to buy a 3rd party program that will be almost as good as the blackberry.  But you will have to buy this app, and the more 3rd party apps you load, the less stable the device.  What I'm saying is the Treo is a jack of many trades but it's a master of none (except SMS/MMS messaging.)  While I am a Palm faithful, I'm afraid that if you want a *stable* phone, e-mail, address book and schedule, the blackberry is the way to go, but you won't have the bells and whistles (camera, mp3 player, 3rd party apps and touch screen) that come with a Treo.  Yes, that means I now have a crackberry.  It was a Xmas gift from a friend who was tired of hearing me complain about my Treo.  Here is the bottom line: if you're getting this device as a business tool where missed calls or e-mails translate to lost money, get a blackberry.  If you want a really cool phone with all the bells and whistles you can fathom and you like loading 3rd party applications and you like having a fun device to play with, then you will absolutely love the Treo.", "summary": "After getting used to it, you can't live without it.", "unixReviewTime": 1157673600}, {"overall": 2.0, "vote": "6", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2006", "reviewerID": "A2M67NF929W1HE", "asin": "B000982UY2", "reviewerName": "Alan Edwards", "reviewText": "Loved the idea of moving back to a palm device after my sony p900 died.

Of course, then you would be limited to connecting to a wireless connection (like a computer) for email and internet, but then not everyone needs email and the internet all the time.

As previously speculated, I wonder if wearing glasses is the reason for the poor fit. I traveled quite a bit last weekend and found that, more often than not, my headset disconnected itself from my phone after a call.  My hands-free-device turned into a pull-over-and-muck-with-it-after-each-call burden.  Maybe I didn't have some obscure setting correct but I looked all over and couldn't find one.  Maybe mine was defective, I'm not sure but it was really more trouble than it was worth.  In almost ten years of ordering from Amazon I am taking advantage of the return policy for the first time.\n\nI found a different headset at 73% off but still $40 (orig $150 / Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece in gold) and it comes with its own chargeable case. Never seen a case that not only protects but also charges!  Other colors are a bit more. Check that one out if you wear glasses.

Amazing in itself but you could barely tell the difference from \"all windows up\" and \"driver/passenger window down.\"\n\nHOWEVER.... I wear glasses and have a rounder face.  It is difficult to place the earpiece on my ear with glasses on.  The bulky part doesn't sit well on my glasses' frame.  The mouthpiece is not adjustable.  I have fuller cheeks and the mic comes in contact with my face.  Not sure why it was made that way since not all faces are the same.  The control buttons are also difficult to manage while driving.  The main control on the side is fine but the tiny on/off and volume buttons were hard to find and press without dislodging the unit.  I turn it on before I place it on my ear.  Maybe that has something to do with it sitting on my eyeglasses frame. I do like the sound quality and will continue to use it for a while before coming back to update.  If it doesn't work well for me I'm sure one of my kids will like it.  (I ended up returning it.

Call quality was excellent and according to the others on the line, i was clear.

I also had no problems adjusting volume while in use. I did not have any difficulties ending or answering calls while wearing from the boom arm mounted button. The one thing I did not expect was the comfort level of the device. I discovered that i quite often forgot I was wearing it. The weight or fit of the device were neither a problem. The Voyager sits snugly on my ear without any pressure.\n  I also use the device for Playstation 3. It paired easily to the Playstation. On the first attempt to use the device i found that for some reason it was clipping badly, almost as if it was sampling at a very very low rate. Other players stated i was unintelligible. I gave up and decided to try again another day.\n  On the second time i tried it, it performed flawlessly, other players were crystal clear and so was I.

I have not measured it, but it far exceeds my expectations.\n  The one thing I have noticed is that while there is a stigma for wearing a bluetooth headset, even though in many states it is necessary for answering in car calls, it is even more so with the Voyager.

It sits perfectly and I can literally wear it all day and not have any pressure points bothering me. It sits perfectly in your ear, so that it feels snug and secure without pinching anywhere.

I often use it outdoors, in the car, and in the house and so far it performs quite well in all those areas.  I get the best results when I have my cell phone on me or am within  10 feet of my phone.  If I get out of range when NOT talking on it, it will beep to let me know and beep again a different tone when I re-enter the accepted range (approx. 30 feet). When I AM talking on it, the static will increase until I get back within that 10 feet or so.  Since I live in a poor reception area, I usually need to set my cell phone in an area where I can pick up a signal, and the Voyager 510 allows me answer away from the phone--at least until I can get to closer range for best reception.\n\n My biggest objection to the headset, and I guess it is minor--I don't like the flashing blue light that tell me it is on.  I have it SET to NOT flash, but if I get outside of range (>30 feet or so) when I am NOT talking on it and then re-enter range, it will start flashing again--if I stay out of range too long (more than a few seconds).  I can't see the flash but others can--and I sometimes forget to check it for flashing--and end up looking like a Christmas tree.  To put it back into its non-flash mode again, I find I have to turn it off and then turn it back on again.  If anyone knows how to deal with this quirk I would appreciate knowing how.\n\nIt is fairly comfortable to wear, and I am glad it came with 3 ear piece options to see which fits the best, as I did have to try all three to get a comfortable fit--and at times even forget I am wearing it.  I don't talk on it constantly, so have had no problems with battery life so far.  It recharges fairly quickly--maybe within 1 1/2 hours??

These are my initial impressions, and I compare this to the Motorola H680 as overall about equal, very similar to the findings by a major consumer-oriented organization as to these two Bluetooths.\n\nI gave my used H680 away to a friend of mine because she was driving me crazy always speaking to me over her speaker phone while driving.  She used the speaker phone out of necessity because in California you can not put the phone to your ear while driving, and her bluetooth's battery had died.  My friend is not mechanically adept and I would've kept the H680 otherwise.  It is smaller and more convenient to use than this Plantronics, but I feel the sound quality with this unit is better.  This unit takes some adjustment so I hope the following comments will be of benefit to those of you who purchase this unit:\n\n1.  Thoroughly read the instruction booklet.\n\n2.  Thoroughly read the instruction booklet.\n\n3.  Once you have thoroughly read the instruction booklet (it's not lengthy) and you get past setting it for your left ear (if that is your desire), the only major thing to do is to determine which of the three eartips is best for you.  This is important for comfort and I suggest that you start with the smallest tip and work your way up.  I am using the smallest tip-it works best for me.\n\nThough the unit appears to be somewhat awkward looking, it really is not uncomfortable on the ear if you accustom yourself to placing the eartip comfortably in your ear first (contrary to the booklet and as if the unit did not contain the curved attachment)-the rest will follow.\n\nSound is crisper than with the H680, and appears louder.\n\nYou can't go wrong with either, but I think I like this one more.\n\nUpdate:  1/7/10  Sound is definitely better with this unit, and it appears to hold charge longer than H680.  Voyager is definitely larger than H680.  When you get past that, and realize the benefits of sound quality and longer use on a charge, you might favor, as I do, the Voyager 510.

Further, I keep my phone's ringer on 'silent' so coworkers don't know when I receive a phone call. The headset simply beeps in my ear, and I click it to take the call. If I am in a meeting or the boss is talking to me, I simply let it beep in my ear 4 or 5 times until the call goes to voicemail. No one even knows I had a call coming! If I am on the phone and someone important walks up to say something, I can easily stop responding to the person on my headset.

I have owned or tested several supposedly great Bluetooth sets with several different phones and devices including iPhone 3G, Motorola Razr and L6, Blackberry 7100i, two different laptops (Skype) and Playstation 3, and no other headset performed as well as Plantronics Voyager 510.\n\nIn parallel with this device I had three different Jabras including BT250, BT500 and JX10 and neither one comes close to the sound quality and wind tolerance of Voyager 510.  I also learned of a number of users including my boss who switched from Jawbone 1 AND 2 to this or Discovery 925 set due to fit, comfort and sound issues, so I never even bothered to buy a Jawbone.

Good output volume and quality. When I'm using Plantronics Voyager 510, people I'm talking to can't tell I'm on a cell phone with a Bluetooth headset - not even when I'm driving (windows closed). The case was the opposite when I was using Jabras, when I used to hear complaints about noise, static and low volume of my voice.\n\n2. Good and controllable earphone volume. It can reasonably well deal with traffic noise when I'm walking outside my downtown Chicago office. I can set the volume really loud, so the only case when I cannot hear my partner is when I'm walking too close to a moving train. My usual volume setting is around 1/3.\n\n3. This set's microphone tolerates wind better than the Jabras mentioned above which used to produce a great deal of wind noise whenever I was encountering a breeze. In addition, if I know I'll be outside in a windy environment I can put the included microphone sponge on.\n\n4. Good battery life. I don't have to charge it often.\n\n5. Although it seems very light and gentle in my hands, it handles everyday folding and switching between my shirt pocket and both my ears very well.\n\n6. No problems with long usage, unlike Jabra BT250, which used to irritate the skin on the back of my ear if I used it too long or too often.\n\nI never heard about Plantronics before buying this headset and I grew to appreciate it a lot more after years of usage.

McKown", "reviewText": "The Plantronics Voyager 510 is a great headset for the right situation.  I've owned a 510 for three years, this latest one to replace the last one the dog chewed up (literally).\n\nThe 510 is a comfortable headset with good battery life.  The quality of the audio I hear is very good, and the quality of the audio my callers hear is also very good.  However, the unit just returned would continuously send a low level static to callers, which wasn't the case with my prior 510.  I assume this was just a defective unit.\n\nThe big strength of this headset is dealing with noise.  In comparison to the other two headsets I gave serious consideration, the Motorola H710 and the Jabra BT8040, the 510 had the best audio in all conditions.  One test was driving down the highway with all 4 windows down, the radio on at a moderate volume and the headset in the right ear.  Cabin noise was so loud that I felt the need to raise my voice level to hear myself.  I was able to hear callers over the noise just barely, and they could hear me, but did hear a lot of background noise as one would expect.  With the H710, I could hear callers well, but I was completely unintelligible to them.  The BT8040 was almost as good as the 510; callers heard me almost as well as with the 510, but I had trouble hearing callers because the audio was cutting in and out, as if echo cancellation was getting confused by all the noise.  All three worked quite well in quieter environments.  The H710 fails to cancel echo (of my voice back to me) when paired with a Uniden cordless land-line phone (with BT support).  The BT8040 fails to pair with the Uniden cordless phone at all.\n\nI ultimately kept the BT8040 and returned the 510 because of some shortcomings of the 510.  First, it is tricky to get on and off.  It took me a long time to figure out how to put it on using one hand, and it takes some fumbling.  It's far easier and faster to use 2 hands to put it on, but this is a hassle, and frankly looks stupid when you're doing it.  I don't like wearing it all the time because it is big and the darn blue light flashes all the time, grabbing the attention of others around you.  I feel like I'm on exhibit when I try to wear the 510 around others.  Finally, the 510 is not a good shape for keeping it in your pocket, and it's large enough that the phone and the headset in the same pocket isn't usually workable.  Which brings us back to the dog and the chewed up headset.  Because of its poor pocketability, I would tend to leave it on the desk or table when not in use.  Doggie finally figured this out.\n\nFor use exclusively as a car or office headset, I'd pick the 510 over all three.

I can wear this all day without noticing it.  It's super-adjustable, so you can rotate the boom up and down your cheek as well as pivot it in toward your face or out away from it.\n\nLoud and Clear.  I can hear my calls well and the incoming audio sounds good, though at higher volumes, there's a slight rattle.  People I'm talking to say it sounds clearer to them than when I am using my Motorola headset.\n\nDecent Battery.  I normally charge mine every other day, but I can let it go for several days without having it drain completely.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nI don't like that the headset does not make a tone when a call ends like my others do.  You can hear an audible \"pop\" when the sound cuts off, but it's subtle enough that I still don't talk smack on the person who hung up until I can verify on my phone that the call has ended.  :)\n\nWho designed the power/mute button?  Seriously?  You just about need a hydraulic press to turn the thing on.  The button doesn't \"click\" down very distinctly, so you have to just squeeze hard and watch for indicator lights to know when you're turning it on and off.  One other review stated that it's virtually impossible to turn on and off when it's on your head.  Truer words have never been spoken.\n\nThat rattle at higher volumes?  Kind of annoying.\n\nI don't like that I have to hold the talk button down for 1 second before placing a call, either.  Like, why not just have to tap the talk button like on most other headsets?\n\nThe Ugly (yea, I know, \"original,\" right?):\n\nUnless you are a Night Elf, you might find that the thing is a little big on the ear and super-obvious.  It's not dead sexay by any stretch of the imagination.  However, with gray and...gray colors, it's not fugly, either.

And I can say that it's kind of neat.\n\nPairing it with my cell phone and my laptop wasn't too much of a hassle. I, as well as any future buyers, may be glad to know that this device supports the A2DP protocol (audio transfer), which means that you can listen to music on your laptop with your headset (although it is less than desirable quality), and if you get a call on your cell phone, you can hit the call button once to disconnect yourself from your laptop to connect to your cell phone, then hit the call button again to answer your phone. All without touching either device. =p One minor gripe, however, is that it's not very convenient to switch back to being paired with my laptop, since I have to pair the headset with my laptop again. Maybe there's a way for my laptop to \"call\" the headset so that I can switch connections the same way I did it for a phone call, but I'm not sure as to how to do that.\n\nThe sound quality of this headset is very good. People can hear me clearly and I can hear them quite well, actually. Most headsets suffer the bane of crappy volume levels; the Voyager 510 seems to amplify the volume so that normally-soft phone calls are clear and audible.\n\nThe buttons are less than desirable, though. I'm not sure if it's just me, but the volume is a little difficult to adjust while the headset is on my ear, and the power button is just impossible to get at while on my ear. You need to power it on and off after taking it off. The call button on my first headset became defective after a few months (which would explain my hours of frustration on not being able to pair the darn thing to my computer), but I'm sure it was a lemon. Update on this will follow if the call button goes on my current 510.\n\nSpeaking of ears, I can wear this thing rather comfortably for an hour or two at a time without too much discomfort.

On the other hand, this could be a plus; it's not likely you'll accidentally turn it on.\nThe main control button for answering and initiating calls in kinda small, but I'll get used to it.\nOverall, worth the money and better than the HS820 and HS850.\n\nUPDATE 11/13/07 I have now exchanged this headset TWICE for the same problem. The center pin on the charging jack DISAPPEARS inside the unit and it will not charge. After getting the latest replacement, I called Plantronics Tech Support and spoke to Will. I asked him if I was doing anything wrong and he said that I wasn't and that they had seen this problem from other users. He also said that if it happened again, I should contact Tech Support, ask for him and he would see about upgrading to a different headset that doesn't have the problem. NOW I CALL THAT SUPPORT! This is a great product and with support like that I will be buying more Plantronics gear and recommending it to my friends.\nUpdate: 05/07/08 I have now had the headset replaced twice and the second  replacement now had lost the center charging pin. I contacted Will in tech support and am getting a 520 to try. Hopefully the center pin on this one will work better ot the cheap charging stand will help. i'll let you know!", "summary": "This is a good headset! but check the updates at the end!", "unixReviewTime": 1187568000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2007", "reviewerID": "A33SJOJMA35U77", "asin": "B0009B0IX4", "style": {"Package Type:": " Standard Packaging"}, "reviewerName": "Leo Kwong", "reviewText": "The reason to get this headset is comfort.

Not good, not bad, pretty much on par with the other 3 BT Headsets I've owned. I will say that it seems this unit charges more quickly than the other I've owned.\n\n2.  I wear Glasses:  It fits Ok with them. The only problem comes when you remove your glasses with the Headset on; the Headset is prone to fly off. I can tell you that the unit is durable after several such flights.\n\n3.  Comfort:  I'm a \"big guy,\" 285 lbs.  Comfort didn't come quickly for me.  I still need to change ears a couple of times a day.  However, after around 30 days it is much better and I expect one day I'll not even know it is there.\n\n4.  Sound:  Good most of the time.  Better than the others I've owned.  Loud.  If you drive the highway this one works well.  Background noise is reduced but not eliminated; and unlike another background reducing Headset I own (from Plantronics also) there is no delay on call pick-up... nice!\n\n5.  Props to Plantronics.  By pressing the volume + key as you turn the unit on, the blinking blue light gets turned off (and on), this is important to me because people look like Cyborgs walking around blue blinking in public (not professional at all).\n\n6.

I finally have a phone that has Bluetooth capability, and I was keenly interested in a wireless headset that wouldn't have the cord tangle issues of corded headsets.\n\nThis device does exactly what I wanted it to do.  It was a piece of cake to setup on my Verizon Samsung u540 phone.  You wouldn't even need to crack open the user manual except to discover the 4-digit code you have to plug-in to your phone (it's 0000, btw).  After that, it's a snap to turn on and link to my phone.\n\nMy other important concern was voice clarity, both on sending and receiving.  Thus far, after several hours of use, I can tell you that the voice reception I hear is crystal clear.  No crackling, no hollowing or echoing.  On the other end, I've not had anyone complain about being unable to hear my voice or that my voice is coming across muddled -- interestingly, I've had such complaints while using my old, corded headset!\n\nThe power button *is* small and it *is* a tad more difficult to depress than you might want, but then, you won't accidentally turn on or turn off this device because of the way it's designed.  I agree with others -- turn on the device before putting it on your ear, and do the same when you're turning it off.\n\nAs for noise canceling, my wife and I tested out this device in very noisy home with four small kids, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how well this headset communicated my voice but not the ambient noise in the room.\n\nUsing the volume control on the headset was pretty easy to do.  Note that you can control voice volume either through the phone handset volume control or the control on this Plantronics headset.  If other reviewers are complaining about low volume from this headset, it's likely because one of the two volume controls is turned down too low, or perhaps the mobile phone their using doesn't have much by way of signal output.  This Plantronics headset has *plenty* of loud volume if that's what you want.\n\nAs for ear comfort, I found it to be very comfortable, although I haven't worn it all day long.  I talked to a friend for an hour yesterday, and I had absolutely no discomfort at all.  The device comes with three earpieces (small, medium and large).  I use the medium with great results.\n\nThe phone fits snuggly on my ear and it doesn't move around at all, although I'm not jogging or even walking much while using it.\n\nI like the more discreet look of having the \"guts\" of this device behind my ear, with a thin microphone on the side of my face, rather than the fat Motorola designs.\n\nOther reviewers have cautioned about the headset breaking, so I just take very gentle care while handling it.  I suspect I won't have a problem with it falling apart.\n\nI can't speak to battery life, because after a lengthy phone call, I just recharge it so it's ready for the next call I might make.  Charging it is easy to do and doesn't take long, either.\n\nIn sum, I'm very satisfied with this device.

This time everything worked and I was able to pair it with my phone and a week later, this old faithful, one-in-a-thousand Plantronics headset still works as good as new, and it seems it might give me a few more years of service.  Amazing! /UPDATE\n\nUPDATE June 3, 2007/ I recently received a Jabra JX10 Bluetooth headset and expected it to be the Holy Grail of bluetooth headsets, but in spite of its great fashionable and light design and state of the art electronics, its sound quality is one class below this headset. Plantronics Voyager 510 is still the best/UPDATE\n\nI have owned or tried several supposedly great Bluetooth sets with several different phones, including some Blackberries, Motorola Razr and L6, and here's why I got to appreciate this somewhat clumsy set so much:\n\n1. Good output volume and quality. When I'm using Plantronics Voyager 510, people I'm talking to cannot tell I'm on a Bluetooth headset - not even when I'm driving.  The case was the opposite when I was using Jabra BT250 and BT500, when I used to hear complaints about noise, static and low volume of my voice.\n\n2. Good and controllable earphone volume.  It can reasonably well deal with traffic noise when I'm walking outside my downtown Chicago office. I can set the volume really loud, so the only case when I cannot hear my partner is when I'm walking too close to a moving train.  My usual volume setting is around 1/3.\n\n3.  This set's microphone tolerates wind so much better than the Jabras mentioned above which used to produce a great deal of wind noise whenever I was encountering a breeze. In addition, if I know I'll be outside in a windy environment I can put the included microphone sponge on.\n\n4. Good battery life. I don't have to charge it often.\n\n5. Although it seems very light and gentle in my hands, it handles everyday folding and switching between my shirt pocket and both my ears very well.\n\n6. No problems with long usage, unlike Jabra BT250, which used to irritate the skin on the back of my ear if I used it too long or too often.\n\nThe only reason why I didn't initially give this set 5 stars is the somewhat clumsy power/mute button position.  Years later, after getting familiar with many other competing products and learning how durable this headset is, I think it deserves 5 stars.  Too bad I can't change it.\n\nI never heard about Plantronics before buying this headset and I grew to appreciate it a lot more after a year of usage.  Only recently I discovered that Plantronics has a long history with headsets and that even the Apollo missions used their headsets on the Moon.  Makes sense.  \"One small set for man, one giant leap away from other BT headset manufacturers.

The Plantronics 510 scores 5 stars for comfort, 5 stars for audio reception, but only 4 stars for audio transmission.\n\nTo be fair, today's bluetooth headsets will never be as clear as the handset itself, or a wired headset, because bluetooth headsets sample at 8 KHz (i.e. 8,000 audio samples per second), while wired headsets and phones sample at 16 KHz (16,000 audio samples per second). That is why today's bluetooth headsets will always sound just a bit muffled.\n\nThat said, as far as bluetooth goes, the Plantronics 510 does quite well -- but it has problems. I use it with my BlackBerry 8700. In a quiet environment, such as indoors or in a car with the windows up, audio transmission will be very clear. The boom mic brings the microphone closer to your mouth than do those tiny in-ear headsets, where the microphone is all the way up at your ear. (The microphone is about 3 inches from my mouth, compared to in-ear microphones, which are about 6 inches away.) The closer distance leads to a better, louder sound. However, in a noisy environment, everyone I've talked to finds it somewhat difficult to hear me because the sensitive microphone will pick up a lot of background noise. People have complained that they can hear the beeping of the checkout counter, or all the people chatting at Starbucks, or all the traffic noise, and it's hard to focus on what I'm saying. When I then disconnect the headset and talk directly into the phone, they all say, \"That's much better!\" That said, at least people can make out what I'm saying in a loud environment with this headset; with other bluetooth headsets I've used (e.g. the Motorola HS-820), loud environments render my relatively soft voice completely unintelligible.\n\nAudio reception is great when you're close to the phone; after about 5-10 feet away, you start to get clicks and pops. (Also, there are a fair number of clicks if I use the headset in my right ear while keeping the BlackBerry in my left pocket; my phone and headset need to be on the same side of my body, it seems, for the clearest sound.) The headset is very loud, and I usually listen to callers at about half-volume.\n\nIn terms of comfort, Plantronics provides three styles of earbuds: small, medium, and a triangle-shaped larger one. After trying them all, I prefer the medium-sized bud -- I can keep the headset in my ear for over an hour without any discomfort, and sometimes I forget i am wearing it. Admittedly, it took me a while to figure out how to put in on with one hand, but I soon got the hang of it. It now takes me no more than 2 seconds to put it on. (Hint: Hold the earbud/boom-mic section with your thumb and middle finger, and lift the bulky back section up with your forefinger. Place the earbud in your ear, and then remove your forefinger and let the back section naturally fall back behind your ear. It sounds more complicated than it is, but it takes some getting used to.)\n\nI used to complain about the small power button, but then I realized that it's extremely easy to press down once the headset is on your ear. Contrary to popular belief, it is NOT a rocker switch; it presses down, but if you try to power on or off while not wearing the headset, it is tricky to find the right angle at which it needs to be pressed.\n\nSo, bottom line: This is the best bluetooth headset I have ever used. When I am taking business calls at home and I want to sound as clear as possible, I either talk directly into the headset or use a wired headset with a boom microphone located 1-2 inches from my mouth -- but as far as bluetooth headsets go, the Plantronics 510 is extremely convenient for use when walking about town, or driving. I am giving it four stars because it isn't PERFECT (and I only give five-star ratings for perfection). That said, I will continue to use it as my daily headset until the coming of the Perfect Trifecta of audio transmission, audio reception, and comfort -- which almost certainly will be achieved by Plantronics.", "summary": "Great bluetooth headset, with some caveats", "unixReviewTime": 1175904000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2007", "reviewerID": "A30CKRWYADTSVU", "asin": "B0009B0IX4", "style": {"Package Type:": " Standard Packaging"}, "reviewerName": "DiceDemon", "reviewText": "I've never written a review in my life, but I love this headset so much that I thought it was time I did.

It worked well for about 10 (maybe 12) minutes and then fell apart.  So, I would not suggest considering anything under $100.\n\nUnless you consider this one.\n\nWhen I returned my first headset to Fry's Electronics I asked them what their most popular model was.  The sales guy said it was the Plantronics 510.  I tried it on and it felt really good.  I've been using it for about two months now and I love it to pieces.  It works as well now as it did the moment I bought it (actually, better, because it needed a charging).\n\nPositives:\n\n1)  Comfort.  This was the biggest attribute I was looking for as I wear this a lot.  After putting it on I usually forget it is there within two minutes.  It is light weight and very easy on the ears.  I only remember when somebody calls me and I hear the beeping in my ears.  With a flick of the wrist, this easily converts between the left and right ear and both feel extremely comfortable.\n\n2)  Sturdy.  I travel a lot and airports are not kind to any belongings, especially ones crammed into a bag.  But this thing has taken its lickings and keeps on going.  Must better than the first one I bought which fell apart over nothing.\n\n3)  Great sound quality.  I've used this at airports, casinos, and convention centers.  I can always hear my party without any problems and I've never had anybody complain that they can't hear me.\n\n4)  Simple to work.  Probably the most difficult thing about this is getting it recognized by the phone.  And that isn't complicated at all as that only took me 2 minutes, and most of that was searching for directions on how to do it.  Picking up the phone is as easy as hitting a button.\n\nOn a side note, I have two Bluetooth cellphones and I can switch between the two automatically without any hassle.  Because of this ease of switching over I am considering getting the phone base so I can use this on my office line at home as well.  I know somebody who uses it and she has no problems with it.\n\nNegatives:\n\n1)  I wish there was a way to turn off the blinking blue light.  It drives me crazy especially while driving at night.  Half the times I see it blink I think  I'm getting pulled over.  Also, it keeps blinking whether you are using it or not so I usually cover it with a hand towel when it is charging at night.  But this seems to be inherent of any bluetooth device.\n\n2)  Ummmm.... I can't think of any other negatives.\n\nSo, I highly suggest checking this one out.  I can't say that this is for everybody because I've learned that no two ears are exactly alike.  The biggest thing I was looking for was comfort.

Worked well until the recharge plug snagged on the socket and parts of the socket came out with the power plug.  So I replaced it with the Plantronics 510.  I wanted an earpiece that inserted into my ear as oppose to laying on top of my ear like the old World War 2 headsets of 50 years ago.  I sometimes am in noisy environments and the \"lay on the ear\" type is not designed to isolate loud distracting noises.  The HS850 was difficult for me to hook over my ear and took both hands at times.  Not so with the Plantronics, at least for me.  It goes on my ear much easier and the earplug type earpiece shuts out more of the noisy world attempting to interrupt my communications.  The earplug type earpiece also provides vastly improved volume.  I had to crank up the MOT to full and still had trouble hearing it at times.  Remember, I'm not in an office cube with carpeting and noise absorbing fabric cubicle walls, but in my truck on the highway or on the plant floor.  The clarity of the sound is excellent.  The volume level is more than adequate for me with several levels left to crank up the volumn if I need to.\n\nThe headset is bulkier than my self destructed HS850.  The recharge plug pushes in with a friction fit as opposed to Motorola's press to unlatch type power plug (actually its the same charger that fits many Mot phones) that ripped the guts out of my HS850.\n\nI usually fold the Plantronics 510 into a flat configuration before droping it in my shirt pocket when Im not wearing it.  Folded, its slightly bigger than my previous MOT, but its advantage of putting it on my ear with one hand and the isolating abilities of its earpiece outweigh the small size advantage of the HS850.  And the friction fit recharge plug will never rip the guts out of this BT earpiece.\n\nI found the on-off button very easy to use, unlike the comments of many others.  I can very easily find the pointy button when the 510 is on my ear. Press for 3-4 seconds and it beeps to tell me its on.  2-3 seconds later a series of tones announces that it has connected with my Motorola i870.  A blue led flashes every 4 or 5 seconds when the unit is on and connected.

I have used it for about a month and have recommended it to about 7 people who are in the process of purchasing it.  I may purchase a second unit as a spare or to use with my wifes phone (identical to mine, but used about 10 minutes per month).\n\nMy Sony Erickson Walkman phone lacka a standard head set adapter, so Bluetooth was the only practical solution.  I read most of the reviews and tried several bluetooth from Plantronics, Motorola, and Sony.  I purchased and returned a mid range Motorola and the high end Plantronics. All except the high end Plantronics were barely audible and the Motorola was very hard on the person at the other end.  The Plantronics high end had good volume control, but it had a very poorly designed ear attachment and an equally hokey charger.  The high end Plantronics did have a barely noticable higher clarity on the other end in poor reception situations.\n\nI have found out by reading reviews, talking to users, talking to many sales people and by evaluating headsets that there is  A LOT OF HYPE FOR HEADSETS THAT JUST PLAIN DO NOT WORK.  So, if you want a low risk/high probability of satisfaction choice, the 510 may be the headset for you.\n\nThe Voyager 510 is solidly build, has good volume, is clear on both ends has great battery life and is easily charged.  I can totally control the headpiece from the phone, so I never use the adjustment buttons on the headset except to answer/terminate calls and to power/depower the headset.  I have a Motorola bluetooth hands free speakerphone (also an Amazon purchase).  The Sony phone easily switched to which either the Voyager 510 or the Motorola speakerphone by simply pressing the \"answer call\" button on the desired headset. The 510 has greater clarity than the Motorola speakerphone, but the speakerphone works well for talking to relatives when my wife & I are driving.\n\nLastly, an unintendended, but appreciated, consequence of purchasing the 510 is the reasonable price.\n\nCONS.  I hate the flashing blue \"running lite\" which makes the user subject to looking like a major \"dork\".  I can actually use the lite to see my way around my house in total darkness.

I received  this one as a gift from my friend and love it for two simple reasons:\n\n1) The sound quality is excellent. Despite the fact that it is very noisy in my car when I drive on the highway, I still can hear excellent. I actually do reduce volume on the headset because it has more volume potential than I need. I tried two headsets by Motorola in the past, including HS850. They also have volume button but even when you set to the maximum volume you can't hear well if you in a noisy environment. Plantronics provide you great quality and enough volume for any noisy environment. Also, everyone whom I talked to, told me that they can hear me very well, just like I speak without the headset.\n\n2) Reason number two - it sits perfectly on the ear. It is easy to insert it when you drive, and once it in, it stays there. It doesn't move at all. Unlike Motorola headset, that does not fall off but it moves on your ear and it takes a long time to get used to the fact that it is not falling off your ear.

I kept the Plantronics 510 because it is simply the best I have ever tried. I hear no static, cracks or pops, the audio quality is tops both for me and the caller, and it's comfortable and doesn't flop around on my ear like other headsets do when I move.\n\nWhile the Plantronics may seem slightly larger than other headsets (mainly because it has a larger part that goes behind the ear), it is very comfortable to wear and use, and is very light. It slips into a pocket or bag just as easily as any other Bluetooth headset.\n\nThe Plantronics 510 comes with 3 different sizes of earbuds to fit your ear perfectly and the speaker goes in (or very close to) your ear, unlike other headsets where the speaker just rests on the outside of your ear which is really not good for getting high volume in windy/noisy environments.  Also the Plantronics has a boom mic that folds down partway towards your mouth. This is way better than headsets where the mic is way up by your ear because the closer the mic is to your mouth, the better you will sound and the less background noise the callers will hear. Everyone I've talked to using this Plantronics have raved at how good I sound, especially compared to the crappy Motorola's I've tried previously.\n\nThe Voyager 510 has great battery life both while talking and on standby. The Bluetooth range is superb-I can very effectively walk all around my condo from room to room, talking on the phone, yet my cellphone remains on my computer desk-it really goes 30 feet, and through walls too.  And the fact that this headset can even remember pairing with multiple devices is icing on the cake.\n\nI really recommend this headset. It's money well spent. Or go ahead and try others, but it would be my educated guess that you will end up with this one eventually, like I did.\n\n*There is a slightly misleading bit of text in the instruction manual with regards to charging that you should be aware of: It states that the LED will illuminate Red while charging and illuminate Blue when done charging.

The higher model, Discovery 640 doesn't stand a chance.  Yes the 640 is smaller, cooler-looking, but the features are not good.  The 640 has no windguard, no noice-cancelling tech, and the talk time is short.  The extra battery charger they give you and try to say that it boosts talk time does not.  You can't talk and charge at the same time.  Sheesh.\n\nOKay, so now with the Voyager 510, I love it.  Great fit.  It seems Plantronics has come out with a new version of the 510.  The foam mic boom is not removeable but is built in much like the logitech is.  The voice and sound quality are top notch.  I've recorded myself and it sounds clear.

It comes with a variety of ear tips to help fit your ear. Spend some time with each of them to find the most comfortable. Note that with the non-round ones that you can insert them in 2 directions and no one's ears are the same. The tips can be inserted 180 degrees opposite, then you still get the extra rotating \"play\" they leave you to fine tune it after inserting. I ended up staying with the round one, which is comfortable and yields the flexibility of use on either ear, although I almost always wear it on the same side. I have nearly forgotten it is there and worn it for many hours straight with no discomfort. I will never go back to holding a phone to my head again. When I had a wired headset, I would only ever put it on when I was going to be in the car for a while; it stayed in the car. Now, if I'm not already wearing my headset, I will answer a ringing call with my phone only long enough to get out the headset and punch the button to bring the call to it. My wife thinks I'm weird for putting on the headset to make a call when I have to get my phone out to dial a number anyway (and actually the voice calling works really well on the Samsung!). The fact is that it is so much better sound and more convenient than holding a phone to the side of your head.\n\nI have paired it with my Samsung SCH-i730, a Zonet BlueTooth USB Adapter (for game talk via Ventrilo / TeamSpeak), and a cheapo BT phone base station that lets it function with the phone line at home.\n\nIf I talk too softly, others can't hear me, but I can talk much softer with the headset than when I hold the phone to my head, so it's better than my phone's microphone. It is not the most sensitive microphone compared with the wired professional desk phone headsets at work, but it is one of the best rated for noice cancellation so being able to use it in a noisier environment is priceless. If I have to say something quietly that I don't want nearby people to hear, then I can just cup my hand to one side of my mouth and it directs my voice straight back towards the headset. With this headset, you won't be the jerk standing around yelling on a phone call (but if you are, I hope you get punched!)\n\nQuality of sound is great. I only notice stutter (some people call it static but it's a stutter not a hiss) if I get a wall or two or about 25 feet of clear space away from my Samsung. If my phone is charging in my car, I will just set the phone up on my dash and run into a store to get a refill and not lose the signal while I'm inside. Sometimes if certain things touch against the BT antenna part of my phone, I will hear a little stutter. I just move my arm or whatever it was away from the spot and all is well again. The funny thing is, I can't purposely cause this when I try to cover my phone with my hand or arm; it is only in certain circumstances as if it has to do with the wireless signal bouncing around just right to cause stutter.\n\nI found I could usually go 2-3 days between charges with my casual cell phone use (~20 min a day?). If you are a heavy cell user, expect about 3-4 hours of talk time in 1 day. If you need more you will have to charge this thing halfway through the day.\n\nWhen I started using it with Ventrilo and TeamSpeak, I had to start charging it on my way home from work, as it would only last about 3 hours of talk time after being in standby all day. I have some very good wired headsets for the computer, that I used to use for Internet chatting, but all of them pick up breathing \"wind\" from my nose. I never noticed that in a conversation with someone, but for gaming you sit and wear it while you're quiet a lot. You want to have it transmit when you talk but not when you sit and breathe. This headset sounds many times better than the wired ones, and does not pick up breathing or background noises unless the speakers get turned up too loud.\n\nI ordered a Plantronics USB charger cable, belt clip carry pouch, and an extra pack of eartips from HeadsetZone for a great price. I am not sure if I'd recommend the belt clip if you would tend to lose the headset out of it from a brush against anything that would catch on it. The belt clip leaves about a third of the headset exposed; it's more of a pocket than a case and has nothing but slight friction to keep the headset in it. I almost always have my shirt untucked but I still have to check the headset on my belt often to make sure it isn't falling out. If this concerns you then find something that has a velcro or snapping cover.

The phone is quadband and fully unlocked, so it can be used anywhere in the world.\n\nI really like the RAZR phone.  It's very solid and the voice quality is excellent.  Speak Out Wireless runs on AT&T and T-Mobile networks so the reception quality can vary, but overall the RAZR does an excellent job in pulling in as much signal as possible.

The metallic keypad takes a little getting used to, but is pretty comfy to use.\n\nThe camera is only VGA but takes good-quality pictures when there's plenty of light.  Video capture is jerky and limited to 15 seconds, so that's probably the weakest feature for me.  Bluetooth linkup to a Sony Ericsson earpiece works fine.  Battery life is admirable; I don't use the phone much, maybe just 10 minutes a week, and I need to recharge it once every 8 days or so.\n\nBecause I've owned many Moto's before so I like the RAZR's interface, since it feels familiar, but I can understand how it can confuse users new to the Moto scene.

This unit is not near as loud or as bassy as the Shure, but they don't fall off while I'm on the treadmill either.\n3) Worked well for watching TV in private.\n\nThe cons:\n1) Seems to need it's own bluetooth transmitter. My Powerbook bluetooth connected but the sound was so scratchy and bad that it was unusuable. Plug in the supplied transmitter and everything was fine.\n\n2) The headband is not adjustable and my ear feels bruised after wearing them for an hour. The time I wore them all day at work won't be repeated.\nThe headband is almost a dealbreaker. If it wasn't for that, I'd be using these headphones all the time.\n\n3) The unit is kind of like those watches that use one button for multiple purposes. The button on each part does something different depending on how long you hold down the button. After a couple of days I got the hang of of, but the button on the transmitter is so small, that I have to stop doing anything but holding the button down to turn it off.\n\nOverall, I'd say wireless on a treadmill is worth the ear bruising. I can't count how many times I've accidentally hit the cord with my arm and sent my iPod flying across the room.

It's only a matter of time.  I did some research and found the following tips to prevent/fix the breaking:\n\nSolution #1:\n\nPut the band portion of the headphones in boiling water for a while and slowly spread them open. Once you have them opened up some take them out of the water and let them cool while holding them in the spread position. This reduces the tension of the headphones against your ears and reduces the stress put on the headphone band. This results in two advantages, less pressure on your ears resulting in better comfort and no cracking of the band.\n\nIf you stretch them to far they will fit too loose and will lose some of there bass effect. But all you have to do is reheat them and close them up a little until you get the fit you want.\n\nSolution #2:\n\nEven if your headband has broken in two this will still work. It will only take a little patience and $5.00 of materials from a local hobby shop.\n\nMaterials:\n\n- 3/4 inch or 1 inch nylon tape (all hobby stores that have RC Plane materials have this)\n\n- CA (cyanoacrylate) the stuff that superglue is made of but I recommend getting some real CA at any hobbystore. Get the \"thin\" stuff.\n\n- Saran Wrap. yes the sandwich stuff...\n\n- Scissors\n\nSide note: I call the nylon tape \"tape\", but it is really just a ribbon of nylon. There is no sticky stuff on the \"tape\"\n\n1) First if your headset has snapped completely in two use a little CA to mend it as best as you can. It doesnt need to be perfect but just mended enough that it is technically one piece again and headphones are seperated to where you want them to be.\n\n2) Next cut off a 6 inch piece of the nylon tape and using a VERY small amount of CA, tack the top edge of the tape to the BACK of the band where the crack has occured (which should be exactly in the middle of the band in most cases). Use just enough so it sticks as you don't want too much CA getting into the ribbon. It should be hanging down now in the back like a tail. Note: Use the saran wrap to help hold the tape in place as you are tacking it in place as you DO NOT want this stuff to get on your fingers...\n\n3) Once the CA has dried enough and the tape is stuck, wrap the tape under and around the band one time until the tape is hanging down again in the back. Pull the tape VERY tight and use a little bit of CA at the top to keep it in place.\n\n4) Wrap around one more time and tack it again one more time making sure to always keep the tape tight when you tack it. You should have wrapped the tape around twice at this point. If your set was broken completely in two you may want to wrap one or two more times and at a slight angle to cover a little more area. When done, use some scissors to cut off the excess tape at a point so the cut end of the tape is at the back.\n\n5) Now you can saturate the whole band of tape with CA. Use the saran wrap to press down the cut end of the tape as you glue and it will end up perfectly flat. This is an incredibly strong fiberglass patch similar to carbon fiber. The patch will have a very small profile (not that thick) and be similar in color to scotch tape, however it could easily be painted to match the color of the headband if desired.\n\nThere you have it. This is a permanent and SOLID fix and only takes about 5 minutes. I'm wearing mine right now after i just fixed them. Also you can do this (and I strongly suggest you do) to a set that has not cracked yet, because they WILL NOT CRACK if you do.

With the kind of background noise I get, I couldn't use the Jabra BT500. I have to go with the Plantronics Voyager 510 and all the other issues have to take a back seat to the sound.

It's thinner and lighter than its predecessor, and there's no loss of functionality between the BT250 and the BT500.  Everything that you came to expect with the BT250 is there with the BT500.  It surprises me to see the amount of reviews from people who say the BT250 was awesome but the BT500 is somehow so horrible.\n\nThe technology inside the two headsets is identical.  The exceptions are\n\n1. The pairing function has been removed from the answer/end button and given its own button\n2. The addition of a charging light (shows charging and battery low status)\n3. The headset now attempts to use a \"handsfree\" profile at all times, unless the phone does not support the \"handsfree\" profile.  In that case, the headset will default to a \"headset\" profile.  This is not user-selectable as it was in the BT250.  If your phone supports handsfree profiles, the BT500 will pair with a handsfree profile, no intervention required.\n4. The removal of the \"charging/belt clip cradle\" and the addition of a USB plug for charging.  Now, a lot of hullabaloo has been made in the comments and in other online communities about the \"proprietary plug\" and the fact that \"you still have to carry another cable, even if you want to charge over USB.\"  Fortunately, this is not the case for either assertion.  The socket on the bottom of the BT500 is a USB mini 4-pin female.  This means that *any* standard USB mini 4-pin male cable (or adapter) will fit the phone connector, and will charge the headset.\n5.  The most notable, IMHO, of the losses, is the lack of noise-cancellation circuitry in this model.  This is surprising, as previous versions of the Jabra headsets did.  For those of you who owned a BT250, you'll remember that the mic end had two holes in it: one closest to your mouth, and then one on the other side of the mic bulge.  The circuitry compared the sounds from both mics, and assumed the sound at equal levels in both mics was background noise, while the sound primarily from the hole closest to your mouth was your voice.  It would then cancel out the background noise.\n\nThe removal of the noise-cancellation circuitry means a louder background sound when you're driving in the car than with the BT250.  However, wind noise is not significantly impacted, as the mic is not susceptible to a great deal of wind noise.\n\nThis may be slightly off-topic, but man, you need a mini 4-pin Male for this thing, a mini 5-pin Male for most other USB-powered devices (i.e. Motorola RAZR, Blackberry, etc), and then don't forget about FireWire, Ethernet, and occasionally, telephone cords.  Fortunately, I also have the <A HREF=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/tech-data/B0006OD020/ref=de_a_smtd/002-8876159-6285651?%5Fencoding=UTF8\" target=\"_new\">Cables To Go Port Authority 2 Retractable Cable Kit</A> that I take on the road with me.  It includes both the mini 4-pin Male adapter to charge the BT500, the mini 5-pin Male for most other USB devices, a USB B Male connecter (for things like portable printers, it's a squarish sort of connecter rather than the rectangular USB connecter on the PC), and adapters for RJ-11 and RJ-45 (even a crossover connecter), and a headset and microphone for making your Skype calls.\n\nBut hey, if your PC has Bluetooth, you could pair your BT500 to the PC and use it for your Skype calls.  This works effectively as well.\n\nAnyway, back to the BT500.\n\nPROS:\n- Lighter and thinner than its predecessor\n- Great battery life\n- USB charging\n\nCONS\n- No noise cancellation circuitry\n\nCouldn't give it 5 stars because of the lack of noise-cancellation circuitry.

She got a Treo650 and I got the LG8100.\n\nPairing the device was relatively easy, once you followed the written instructions. However, we've both had problems with the headset staying paired with our phones on a couple of occassions, and have to run the pair-up process again.\n\nWhen they work, the sound is pretty good. But most of the time, they don't work very well at all. And for the record, typicall my headset is with 3-4 feet of my phone - and I've had the same problems when it's less than 2 feet away with perfect line of sight.\n\nMy wife and I almost never can call each other using our headsets and connect on the first try. Oh, it will call and we'll try to answer, and it will sound loud and usually clear - but one of us can't hear the other 99% of the time - at all. It's a series of \"hello-hello? HELLO?\" Forcing us to hangup and call again. Then we usually are connected.\n\nWhen we do connect, the sound typically has some static, minor digital echoing, and/or frequent dropouts such that you can't hear what the other party is saying. It's very annoying - almost like when you try to fake that your getting bad reception on your cell phone an...it...sou...ds..li..is.\n\nThe one button feature is ok once you figure out what the various presses on it do. I've never had to adjust the volume buttons, but they are basically up and down.\n\nMore annoying is the continuously strobing blue LED on the main button. When the headset is powered on, the button flashes. When you are actually using the headset (connected to a call) the button flashes faster. This confuses people when you are wearing it - because it appears to them that you must be using it since it's flashing. But it's always flashing! So if you are a person who uses it a lot and doesn't take it off very often, that can cause a problem.\n\nEven MORE of a problem is driving with it at night. For a week, I drove home in the dark with my headset, and found myself constantly turning my head to look for emergency vehicles as I kept seeing this blue strobe out of the corner of my eye. But of course when I turned my head, it was gone. I finally figured out it was the reflection of my headsets indicator light reflecting off the windows! That can't be good.\n\nOn the plus side - it is very lightweight and easy to wear on either ear. It comes with an AC and a USB charger - which was great since I could charge it at work or with my laptop. It seems to hold a charge very well for long periods. I know I've gone an entire week without recharging. The range seem pretty good - though I usually never get beyond a few feet from my phone.\n\nEven though I can't take this headset back, I'm purchasing another one because this one is pretty much useless if the intent of it's design is to have a simple to operate, hands-free and safe method of communicating with your cell phone.

Plus they have rollover minutes.\n\nI have the black Razor, my wife has the silver. The biggest complaint we both have is the volume of the ear speaker. My sister-in-law can't use the phone at all because of this. I find that I can hear a little better if I put the phone up higher on my ear and am listening to the screen instead of the ear hole. Several times, when trying to hear better and pressing the phone firmly to my ear, the connection has dropped. I don't know if it is because of my pressing too hard or not, but usually after redialing and not pressing as hard it doesn't do it again.\n\nPros\n-Sleek, fits in just about any pocket\n-aluminum outer case is sturdy, my wife has dropped hers a couple of times and it still works\n-Large screen\n-loud speaker volume\n-keypad is nicely lit for night/darkness\n-good camera/movies and storage space\n- built in vibration mode, don't need to buy a special battery like some older phones\n-lots of storage for games and ring tones\n-nice outer screen for caller ID\n-ability to take your own picture with phone closed\n-Impressive Battery Life. I don't make many calls, so am mostly on standby, but I can go 30 hours and the phone still has plenty of juice\n-Blue Tooth enabled\n\nCons\n-LOW earpiece volume\n-difficult to read screen outside in bright light\n-the manual is the size of a small phone book\n-hard to open with one hand\n\nNeutral\n-Finger pads may be difficult to hit for people with large fingers\n-buttons you can access on the side when closed for various functions. My wife hits them all the time (in her pocket and purse) and accidently sets her phone to silent and misses calls. I like the ability to change ringtones without opening the phone and going through the menu.\n-Everyone seems to have one now and the novelty has worn off.\n\nAbout my Cingular service\n\nWe upgraded from Verizon with phones that were not multimedia nor connected to the internet. So naturally, our Cingular service is more expensive. However, they seem to charge for everyting. For instance, you pay for just about every download you make, including ring tones. Its like paying double, you bought the ring tone and they charge you a download fee on top if it. You have choices on how you want to pay for multimedia but even if you choose a plan that gives you X number of Multimedia Messages you also have to pay the plain IM fee even if you don't send regular IMs.\n\nIt took Cingular 3 billing cycles to fix an error that was made when the account was set up. They are very nice, but come on, 3 months!?!?\n\nWe live in West Metro Atlanta and seemed to have fewer dropped calls with Verizon. It may be the coverage, it may be the difference in the phones.\n\nAnother note is that a I know someone with a Verizon Razor and the software is different.\n\nBottom line is that the most important aspect of any phone is the ability to hear the person you are talking to!!! I would probably do more research and choose a different phone if I had it to do again.\n\nUPDATE: After 5 months my phone malfuntioned. No matter what button you pushed, it only dialed the internet. Cingular was wonderful. It was still under warranty (not the extended) and I got a new phone sent to my house in 1 day. They split the expedited shipping cost so it was only $7.50. The ear volume seems a little better then the old phone. Pictures seem washed out, even with reducing the brightness. This is minor and I am keeping the replacement.

Since there are already numerous reviews on what's good about it, so I will focus on what I didn't like...\n\nThe phone advertises that it can be charged via USB. This, however, cannot be done unless you purchase a USB cable and their phone tools software separately ($30 for the latter). Also, the \"custom wallpaper\" and \"MP3 ringtones\" are also misleading. Either you purchase their Mobile PhoneTools software, or the only way to get \"custom\" wallpapers and ringtones is to pay individually for each one.\n\nThe user interface is also terrible. It looks pretty (colorful backgrounds and icons), but it is not especially functional. The menus are all slow to respond (upwards of a quarter-second delay after every key press), and with the default settings, you spend more time fumbling through the oversized icons than actually performing the desired tasks. The phone book is especially awful. Rather than adopting a heirarchial phone book system, they keep it flat (ie. one entry per number). There are some workarounds to this, but even then, they lack the simple yet efficient system adopted by Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Samsung, and others.\n\nFinally, the memory... all whopping 5MB of it. There's about 1MB of crappy animated backgrounds and unwanted ringtones that you cannot delete as well, and no room for expansion memory (eg. flash memory devices). With flash memory at less than $20 for 256MB, I don't understand why Motorola would only put 5MB in their high-end phone (originally listed at $500+). Between the camera, custom wallpapers and ringtones (if you shell out the cash for them), and other media, that 5MB is really inadequate.", "summary": "Caveat emptor", "unixReviewTime": 1132704000}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 6, 2005", "reviewerID": "A37VSLTWMPFH3K", "asin": "B000A1329U", "reviewerName": "Nevets616", "reviewText": "this is probably one of the sleekest phones out there. only one problem the battery life is horrible, dies in about one day. and there arnt much apps. but who cares the phone looks hot!

Some people have said you can't add more than one piece of contact info per contact, which is NOT true. You can, but its nearly hidden underneath the \"MORE\" function while editing the contact. However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle.\n\n1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts. I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts, so I transfered all of them to phone memory. No dice. The scroll speed is untenable. Even my wife's Moto V330 is quicker. What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list.\n\n2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn't loud enough. Plus, the \"audio sweet spot\" on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone.\n\n3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? \"Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower.\"\n\n4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don't buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says \"Sorry, we don't offer games for your phone yet\". My wife's V330 has a similar issue. She's had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone. Again, I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV.\n\n5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part\n\n6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the button again, at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again.\n\n7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I've managed to get it to work, but not without some work.\n\nAlright, so now for the good.\n\n1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don't. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades.\n\n2) Great battery power. I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left.\n\n3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I'm lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I've not had any issues. The phone is rock solid.\n\n4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar?\n\n5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven't played around with the software yet, so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree.\n\n6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space.\n\n7) Did I mention this phone is attractve?\n\n8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud.\n\nThis phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily, I'd be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it.\n\nHopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times.", "summary": "Great looking phone....if yer into this sort of thing", "unixReviewTime": 1125446400}, {"overall": 1.0, "vote": "13", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "08 18, 2005", "reviewerID": "A1AK7698PXKAGN", "asin": "B000A1329U", "reviewerName": "TheBatman", "reviewText": "I finally decided to purchase the Razr based on the facts that my current service is not very good in my are, my GF has Cingular(free wireless to wireless), the Razr had tons of cool features, my old phone's battery is dead, and it's the only phone that came close to the thinness of my Sanyo SCP 6200.

Upon installation, I did not see any improvement. I contacted Wi-Ex and after a few days of bitching, they sent me a new system. The new system was a bit better but still did not do what they claim it to do. I've continued to use this booster for 8 months total now and here is my analysis.\n\nFirst, they claim that this unit will cover a home of 2500 sq ft. LIE.\n\nSecond, they claim that this will reduce dropped calls... HALF A LIE\n\nHere are the facts:\n\n1- You will only get a boosted signal from the base unit ONLY if the receiving antenna has a strong signal. I have 2 bars in my attic, where the receiving antenna is installed, and the coverage range from the base unit is only anywhere from 2 inches to 3 feet from the base unit.\n\n2- In my situation, the coverage area dramatically drops as soon as I'm out of the 3 foot radius of the base unit. As soon as I'm about 10 feet from the base unit, the signal will drop to zero bars on my phone (Palm Pre) and the phone will intermittently switch to Roaming. (This also occurs with an HTC Touch Pro 2 as well).\n\nI contacted Wi-Ex and they told me that the max range of the boosted signal will be 15 feet. That's right, he said 15 feet. They why do they advertise full house coverage? And also claim a 2500 sq ft home coverage on this unit. I was also told that if my input signal is only two bars, that the output from the base unit is reduced to a lower radius/range. This is not what is advertised. As a matter of fact, while I was on the phone with the rep, he kept asking me to repeat myself because I kept breaking up. He asked me to repeat myself three times, yes, three times, and my distance to the base unit? About two feet at that time and the bar strength indication on the phone? That was at 1 bar!! Yes, 1 bar!!!\n\nSo basically, if you have full bars (a strong signal) outside of your home, then the boosted signal inside your home will be greater. I want everyone to know this. DO NOT BE MISGUIDED!!!! This system is only as good as your signal outside your home. If you have FULL strength outside your home and have no signal strength inside your --- a basement for example, then, you will have good coverage in your basement room ONLY.\n\nAlso, I wanted to troubleshoot this some more so I bought a Wilson 800/1900 booster. Identical to this Wi-Ex unit. I tried a combination of several things. I used the Wi-Ex receiver with the Wilson base and the Wilson transmitting antenna, the Wilson receiving antenna with the Wi-Ex base unit and the Wilson antenna and so forth..... and this is what I learned:\n\nThe Wilson system gives you a better coverage radius than the Wi-Ex unit. However, the Wilson unit continuously loses it's signal and the base unit's LED will switch from green to amber to red quite often! Again, neither of these units really improves your indoor signal if your outdoor signal is not at 100%. DO NOT EXPECT YOUR INDOOR RECEPTION TO BE BOOSTED THROUGHOUT YOUR ENTIRE 2500 SQ FT HOME!! This will NOT happen. These two units are misrepresented to make a sale. This is not to say that the Wilson is a better buy, it is not! The coverage radius is only increased by about 1 foot using the Wilson unit. As soon as you are out of this range, your signal will drop and switch over to Roaming as well.\n\nDo not waste your money on either of these two systems if all you need is coverage at your computer desk. You might as well buy their lower priced units that you suction cup to your window.

MSakamoto", "reviewText": "Summary:\nMy results are good. I am an electrical engineer and also followed all the directions. The booster's transmitter could afford to be about 2-3dB stronger. Still, my goal of making my GSM (T-Mobile) phone useful inside my house was well achieved with some minor effort.\n\nDetail:\nI purchased my YX500-PCS for use with my T-Mobile Blackberry Pearl 8100 in Saratoga, CA. I live in a one story, 2400 sf, ranch style home with a metal roofing system called \"Calpac\" that uses formed and coated sheet metal panels to simulate a tile roof. The house structure is wood framing with wood siding on the front side and stucco on the other three. I mention this because this means that my house is at least partially shielded by metal on top and on the three stucco sides (remember that stucco is hung on steel mesh). If you have a similar home, you should seriously consider placing the remote antenna of the YX500 outside of your house and not in the attic as others have done. You don't want to have metal between the antenna and the cell tower.\n\nBefore the YX500, I could not reliably connect to my T-Mobile service inside my home. At best, I could get one bar near certain windows. I could get satisfactory reception by taking my phone outside and seeking out a \"line of sight\" path to the cell tower. After installing the unit with my antenna attached to the chimney on my TV antenna mast, I can use my phone pretty much throughout my home. Placement of the base station is more sensitive than I would have liked to see. The issue is that it's transmission strength is usable, but weaker than I would have liked to see.  My expectation was that I would be 3/5 bars as a minimum, and the reality is that I lose a bar ever ten or so feet. This is mostly OK since I get 5 bars when close to the unit (within 10 feet). So, you must make sure it is centrally located and that your principle location in the house (say, your desk or office) does not cause the booster to be on the other side of the funrnace/AC (if you have central HVAC), water heater, etc. Remember, avoid metal, especially grounded metal, objects. They absorb or block the radio waves you are trying to receive. In any case, I temporarily set up the antenna and the unit as recommended in the instructions and moved the components around to get the best signal strength on my phone's meter. One of the reviewers commented that he \"can't see radio waves\" and neither can I. We can all MEASURE them, however, and that is what we are doing in a crude way with our cell phone signal strength meter.\n\nIn any case, I ended up installing my antenna outside on my TV antenna mast. In general, higher up should be better to avoid the obstruction of buildings, etc. You should check the location of the nearest tower that serves your area and your carrier. There are websites that can help with this (e.g. [...]) or you can simply contact your carrier directly. Once you know your nearest tower location, you should locate your antenna so that there is as much of a clear view as you can achieve to that site. Of course, a totally clear view may not be possible. You should try to avoid metal structures, concrete stuctures (they have metal reinforcements), etc. Trees and vegetation should be less of a problem. Some wood frame houses will block reception and some won't. It depends on what is inside and if they have some hidden metal like mine has.\n\nIn any case, your goal is to get the strongest signal to the outside antenna you can, because the YX500 is a signal booster or amplifier. It follows that if you have no reception when you climb up a ladder or onto your roof outside with cell phone in hand, you will not fix anything with a booster because there is nothing to amplify or \"boost.\" Conversely, if you get the antenna positioned to receive the strongest signal from the tower or cell base site, you will also get the strongest signal and best results inside the house, too. To put it another way, this unit \"captures\" the best signal you can find with the external antenna and then sends it into your home via the cable it is attached to. The base unit then re-issues that signal back out through its antenna as well as receiving your cell phone's signal and sending it the other way. The signal inside your house is not going to be better than the one that is initially captured outside. If you only had one bar of reception and it was scratchy when standing at a high spot outside with your phone, you are going to just get a somewhat more powerful, but similarly distorted signal once you install the booster.\n\nIn any case, after installing and testing this unit for goodness with my Pearl, my son's friends came over armed with a bunch of ATT (Cingular) phones which are all GSM. Previously, these did not work at my house, but now they all do. This might not be that much of a blessing in this specific case :-) but the system has now been tested with two services and the latest RAZR variants on ATT as well as my BBY.\n\nBottom line, do a lot of signal monitoring with your cell to see if you can even use this device.

It did refuse to turn on and I thought it broke, but after a few tries, it worked again.\n\nAlso I found that very cold weather impedes the performance of the battery (yellow warning meter). When the phone warmed up again indoors, I got 2 bars on the meter.\n\nMy first gripe when I turned it on was the ugly interface and dull colors of the menus and overall ugly visualization. The menus are hard to navigate and I've had this phone for 4 months without knowing how to increase the volume! I consider myself a computer and technology expert.\n\nThe other MAJOR gripe is that you can't have multiple phone numbers for the same person! you have to have a separate entry for each, so I have 4 entries for some people (a work phone, home phone, cell, etc). What gives? In this day and age Motorola chooses to ignore this basic feature?! My previous phones was an old 1 color Nokia. Nokia knows how to design a very good interface. Motorola needs to get off their lazy butts and offer an firmware upgrade or some remedy. The camera is laughably bad. 640x480. Pictures look muddy and brown.\n\nText messaging is good though, because of the predictive input style. Other than the style and the input system, I don't have much to say here. The internal memory is shockingly limited. If I recieve more than 30 messages in my INBOX, the phone starts giving me a memory full warning. And you can't free up space by deleting some of the ugly wallpapers and motorola animations that are included. They're locked. Additionally, because all the buttons are on 1 flat surface instead of being individual buttons like other phones, they are a little hard to push and don't give a good springy feel. (one reason, besides cost, that I don't text message at all).\n\nForget about the gimmicky mp4 video or mp3 playback feature. You will NEVER use this (or even figure out how to get it to work). The phone has 5 MB total memory.. the average MP3 is 4-5 megs. The phone has no additional storage options. You do the math here.\n\nThis phone is all looks and no substance.

Let me count the ways in which the Razr fails horribly.\n\n1. It can only capture video clips of about 3 seconds, which isn't even longer enough for me to send a video to Motorola to tell them 'This phone is a piece of...' (click).\n\n2. The Bluetooth integration with Outlook doesn't work. I used to be a computer programmer and I can't even figure it out.\n\n3. Motorola has never figured out menus. Just turning off the keypad beeps (one of the most annoying technological inventions in the post Jar-Jar Binks Lucas era) takes you through a labyrinthine maze of menu options. And it then occasionally resets itself anyway.\n\n4. You cannot add more than one number per entry (eg. James cell, office, home, etc). I thought this was a guaranteed feature on all phones made since the turn of the millennium, but I'm wrong once again. So all my entries are MarkHome, MarkCell, etc.\n\n5. There's something weird with the keyboard layout that makes texting really hard.\n\n6. Although you shouldn't be surprised that anything from AOL is useless, AIM has transcended the word 'pointless' and become a unique DaDa-esque experience.\n\n7. The manual reads like stereo instructions (\"Thanks for buying this piece of...\") and doesn't tell you anything useful at all.\n\nThis is on top of the delightful service from T-Mobile. You won't need a ringtone because the phone will never be able to receive a call. I'd recommend creating a shortcut to voicemail as you'll use it all the time.\n\nAnyway, there are many more things that are truly horrid about the Razr but I'm too irritated to mention them. The best thing about it is that it's small enough to lose.\n\nOh, one more thing - the whole marketing spiel about aircraft aluminum. I mean, is this super-aluminum or something? Or is it the same aluminum that Ford uses to make bad cars and I use to burn food on the barbecue?

I believe many others have this tendency as well.  After using this phone for about 2 months, I hope this review will reflect more on the actual product rather than the initial euphoria after the immediate purchase.\n\nAnyway, on to the review.  The best feature of this phone is the design.  This is one of the few phones which you can actually put into your front shirt pocket without feeling too dorky at work, which is a great thing.  The phone is also very light and stylish.  A definite attention grabber in more rural areas.  The biggest problem with this phone is the reception.  Unfortunately, since reception is the top of my list as a metric to judge phones, this phone fails miserably at that.  At the end of the day, I kept my old Motorolla phone from Verizon as my business cell phone.  It later does work in many places that the Razr would not.\n\nAs with other recent cell phones, this phone comes with the standard Video/Camera features.  To be honest I have never really used the video feature in any of my phones.  The Camera feature can be useful if you travel alot (use it record road names, signs, etc).  It does not work well at night though.  Other than the design, the most useful feature I found on this phone would be the speaker phone.  I don't like to wear headsets, so I use this feature all the time and use the phone like a walkie talkie when I am alone.  The phone comes with 1 golf game, which I have not really played.\n\nIn addition to poor reception, I see that many reviewers complain about the battery life and the ringer volume.  I do find the ring volume to be somewhat low, and the battery lasts about 2 days for me on a full charge.\n\n*Cellphone etiquette* - I don't want to sound preachy but I am simply amazed by the lack of cellphone etiquette some people exhibit in this country.

The speaker function is loud enough, but the clarity drops of as volume increases such that by the time you can hear it...you can't understand it!  A tactile bump on the send and end buttons would have been a nice touch.\n  Obviously, skinny is cool and the silver is nicer looking than the black (unusual).

I strongly recommend that you purchase a genuine MOTOROLLA charger...esp for your car, since many of the knockoffs don't allow you to charge and call at the same time!\n  I wish the text and numbers could be made larger (I'm into reading glasses now) and I really wish the icon for battery strength/charging was large enough to see...or at least have sufficient contrast to do so!

Some people have said you can't add more than one piece of contact info per contact, which is NOT true. You can, but its nearly hidden underneath the \"MORE\" function while editing the contact. However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle.\n\n1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts. I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts, so I transfered all of them to phone memory. No dice. The scroll speed is untenable. Even my wife's Moto V330 is quicker. What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list.\n\n2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn't loud enough. Plus, the \"audio sweet spot\" on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone.\n\n3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? \"Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower.\"\n\n4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don't buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says \"Sorry, we don't offer games for your phone yet\". My wife's V330 has a similar issue. She's had it for over 4 months and T-Mobile STILL offers no games for the phone. Again, I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV. Poor show here, T-Mo.\n\n5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part\n\n6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the button again, at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again.\n\n7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I've managed to get it to work, but not without some work.\n\nAlright, so now for the good.\n\n1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don't. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades.\n\n2) Great battery power. I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left.\n\n3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I'm lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I've not had any issues. The phone is rock solid.\n\n4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar?\n\n5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven't played around with the software yet, so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree, if only to keep the coffers at T-Mo overflowing.\n\n6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space.\n\n7) Did I mention this phone is attractve?\n\n8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud.\n\nThis phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily, I'd be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it.\n\nHopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times.", "summary": "Good phone, but not without its flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1123977600}, {"overall": 3.0, "vote": "14", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2005", "reviewerID": "A27N36BPXB2EKB", "asin": "B000A6KMTI", "reviewerName": "80sGuy", "reviewText": "The usual Motorola \"bugs\" (minor issue).

I got my wife and my boss this phone and they are ok with it though wife is not impressed.\n\nPro's:\n\nThe phone is compact and easy to hold in hand.  It works whether you have big hands like I do or small hands like my wife.\n\nRinger volume is really good.\n\nClarity of sound from the earpiece is good.\n\nCall reception is acceptable.\n\nCon's:\n\nThe speakerphone function is barely adequate.  Even with all the bars (indicating good reception), the speakerphone is very choppy and hard to understand.  We've even tried using it while on a walk through an open field with no obstructions and it didn't improve.\n\nThe menus setup is really bad.  We are not slouches when it comes to using cell phones (I use an XV6600 pocket pc as my phone) but finding common functions like wallpaper settings were not easy to find initially.  The contacts menu is not easy to use and entering contacts is more uncomfortable than painful.  You may struggle with navigating the menus until you have owned the phone for a few weeks.\n\nThe camera is mediocre as best.  Depending on how badly you need a good picture and don't get it one could describe it as terrible.\n\nYou can't change the wallpaper on the intro screen unless it is a picture you take.  This is a simple function to include.  Shame on Motorola.\n\nNo bluetooth withouth an adapter.  There are several phones in this price range that come with bluetooth capability.  Again, shame on Motorola.  (Uhh, Hello, Moto.  Can you hear me now?)\n\nRecommendation:\n\nIf you can live with a slightly confusing phone for a few weeks, then this is the phone for you (it does actually work well for placing and receiving calls).  Don't hang your hat on its features, when choosing a phone, as they are good but not great and in some cases the features are not very useful.  If you need a phone that is easier to navigate and makes more sense, move on to something else.  However, it is one of the better \"low cost\" phones that Verizon currently offers.

So, if you have home/cell/work numbers assigned to a contact, ALL 3 will be displayed no matter what.  That makes scrolling difficult.\n\n3. The phone construction is flimsy.

The poor thing literally fell apart after three months.\n\nI replaced the Cardo today with a Plantronics Explorer 320 and I'm pretty satisfied. First, recognize that there is no such thing as a perfect all-around headset for all phones and all users. It's pretty important that you buy from a source, like Amazon, where you can try things and return them if not satisfied. EBay may have great prices on stuff, but unless you know you'll like something, I wouldn't suggest buying a BT Headset there... way too hard to return.\n\nThe Plantronics 320 is a budget version of their upper end headsets, but it is hard to see where they scrimped. The fit and finish of the product is excellent. The power connector is solid and snapped in and charged the unit quickly. It paired up to my Treo 650 on the first try and was identified correctly by name.\n\nUsing the 320, I made several calls to automated numbers. All connected quickly, except the one where my phone automatically follows a script to punch in passwords. In that call, there was a considerable delay before the 320 took the audio signal from my phone. My old Cardo had the same delay, so I think this is a function of the phone.\n\nThe fit of the headset is great for me. The unit has a small portion that inserts gently in my ear, and the wrap-around portion holds the device closely to my ear without any pressure or discomfort. I've been wearing it all day and it is light and very comfortable. Your mileage may vary.\n\nSo what's not perfect? The sound quality isn't quite there. I pick up some static between the device and my Treo and it gets worse when the phone is on the other side of my body or when I move more than five feet away.

It's not audiophile quality, but if you want that from a $70 wireless headset, your head is screwed on wrong. It's certainly good enough for what I want it for which is casual listening while I'm working.\n\nOne big plus is that the HT820 stays connected to my Treo 700p much better than my Plantronics Discovery 640. With the 640, the headset always drops the BT connection about 1 minute after ending a call. The 640 does this with my Treo 100% of the time. I am reasonably sure it is a problem with the Treo's BT so it is technically not the fault of the 640, but the HT820 appears to handle the Treo BT problem much better.\n\nA few issues I have:\n\n1) My biggest problem is that the rubber that goes over the ears has a bit of a harder edge than I would like and after a little while it gets somewhat uncomfortable. I'm going to try a little moleskin from the local Walgreen's to see if that helps.\n\n2) The sound quality of the microphone is just so-so. My friends that hear me on the other end of my calls say it sounds somewhat muffled compared to my Plantronics 640. They can still clearly hear me and understand what I'm saying, but in a relative comparison the 640 has a better sound detection circuit.\n\nFinally, I do get occasional dropouts on my music, but I know it is the BT software on my Treo again. I can see that when the Treo drops the BT connection, the HT820 tries repeatedly to reconnect and the music from my PC gets spotty until it connects and then it's fine again. The other times I get dropouts is when the X60 is doing something fairly processor intensive. I guess audio is considered low priority in the software and is one of the first things to get put on hold.\n\nAs others have mentioned, there is a noticable lag in the audio when you are watching video or playing games. This is expected because of the extra encoding/decoding step that has to happen when you send it digitally over BT and then the headset has to decode it again. I would say BT headsets in general are best for listening to pure audio since there is nothing visual to be in sync with. They are OK for video if you can deal with the slight delay in the sound. It kinda looks like those old kung fu movies where peoples' mouths will move slightly ahead of when you hear what they are saying. Any BT headset is going to have this issue until they come out with software and system design changes that compensate for it.\n\nI have tried it with some games and they are OK for turn-based games like Galactic Civilizations where the audio is not crucial to the game action. However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up. Gotta stick to low-tech analog headsets for that.\n\nOverall, it is very good but not perfect.

Heath", "reviewText": "I really wanted this headset to work out because it is being sold at such a good price relative to most others.  Well, it prooved to me that you often get what you pay for.  Let's consider the following in why I am returning this headset: pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.\n\nPairing - this really belongs with ease of use, but it is really your first experience with a headset other than charging it.  It was hard to figure out if I was holding the multifunction button down long enough to get the headset in paring mode.  After 4 attempts, I got it right.  My LG VX-9800(see my review)was able to pair with it easily after this.  However, it shouldn't take 4 attempts just to get a headset into pairing mode.\n\nSound Quality - this is actually the area where the headset does the best in my opinion.  With the speaker resting inside my ear, I didn't have to have the volume turned all the way up in order to hear the people I called.  My wife reported that she could hear me clearly with one exception.  When I had the AC fan speed in my car set to 3 (out of 4), she said that it sounded like I was in a wind tunnel.  Kicking the AC down to 2 fixed the problem, but once we hit the Texas summer that could be a problem.\n\nEase of Use - I think that Plantronics' attempt to make this headset easy to use backfired.  I would go to turn on the headset, but I would always have to check my phone to see if it was connected.  Initiating voice commands also required multiple attempts before I would hear the familiar \"Please say a command\" from my phone.  However, what really drove me nuts was trying to turn it off.  I would hold down the multifunction button for what I thought was the amount of time specified in the instructions, but I kept getting \"Please say a command\".  Compare this to the Motorola HS850(see my review) where on/off is controlled by the folding boom while the multifunction button simply handles pairing, voice commands, and call connecting.  I consider my self to have technology savvy and able to fight through things to make them work, but this headset *still* frustrated me.  If you like things to work simply, this headset isn't for you.\n\nComfort - I was willing to put up with the flaky operation of the headset because of the cost; however, I realized after two days that I was not going to be able to stand to wear it for any extended period of time.  The speaker pipes its volume into a rather hard earpiece that fits inside your ear.  It is not removable, and try as I might to adjust it, I could not find a comfortable position.  The ear hook is also fairly rigid.  These two things combined made for an unpleasant comfort experience.\n\nI have to consider this headset to be a failure.  On the box, it touts \"Comfort\" and \"Ease of Use\".  As you can see from my results, it doesn't deliver on either of these.  It's a shame because it does deliver good sound quality at a reasonable price.

At least I was able to keep my number and swap the old SIM into the new phone.\n\nOverall I'm fairly happy with the 8700c. I miss the five-way joystick: navigating in Google Maps is a bit awkward. (Alt+scrollwheel for side-to-side). The keyboard is OK, but \".\" should have a dedicated key. I find the phone sound OK, although some people that I call report high noise levels.\n\nThe biggest issue is switching between silent/vibrate and ring modes. The Treo gets this right: there is a simple, easily visible, sliding switch. You can see instantly what mode you're in, and can switch into silent mode without even removing the Treo from its holster.\n\nOn the Blackberry I have to unlock it (using my password) and get back to the main menu screen just to SEE what mode I'm in (interpreting a small multicoloured icon). If I need to switch modes I then have to scroll to the Profiles applet, select it, choose the right profile, and apply it - a total of 15-20 key presses and wheel scroll events.  This simply sucks. Since I try to be polite and avoid phone interruptions during meetings, I wind up leaving the device on vibrate only, which means that occasionally I miss a call.\n\nRIM really needs to fix this. I can't imagine that anyone else has patented the idea of a \"mute\" switch....\n\nUPDATE, 2/10/07: The usability issues that I mentioned, plus the lack of third-party applications finally got to me.

It does a great job of retrieving email from all five of my accounts, and functions well as a phone and PDA. I am thrilled.\n\nUntil two weeks ago, I was carrying around a top of the line Dell Axim X30 with 624 MHZ and wireless capability, and a cell phone. I teach at several universities and do consulting work so I have five different email accounts and I'm constantly checking my email at least twice an hour. Prior to getting this Blackberry, I had to find a wireless spot to use my Axim, stay tied to my laptop, or pay out the nose for web access on my cell phone. It was terrible.\n\nNow with the Blackberry, all of my email accounts are programmed in so I'm instantly notified when I get a message. Because I can respond within seconds, I never miss a beat. My students and clients often comment that I respond quickly to their needs, which they love. The 8700 from Cingular has GSM and dual band service so I can be almost anywhere in the world and still receive my email messages instantly. I was in Hong Kong last week and the Blackberry functioned flawlessly. I could use it as a phone in HK and also receive and reply to email.\n\nAdditionally, I love the fact that I can synch my MS Outlook calendar, contacts, address book, tasks, etc. to the Blackberry. (It also has the ability to synch with other PIM programs.) I have mine set to sound an alarm 15 mins before I'm due in a meeting or appt and it has been a life saver. When you are always on the go, it's easy to forget stuff. This Blackberry makes it easy to keep everything in one place. Oh, and surfing the web is a breeze.

This will save the battery life.  As long as you are not one of those people who feel the need to wear their headset 24/7, this is a great feature.\n\n2) Once you turn it on (by opening the mic) it re-syncs with the phone in about a half a ring.\n\nThe only issues I have are cosmetic, like I hate the blinking light, but that's just a personal issue.\n\nAt this time, a User Manual does not exist anywhere I could find on the Motorola web site.

I decided to try a the newest Motorola headset and this one worked worse than the cheaper Motorola unit that fell apart in a year. Connectivity was a big issue. It would drop in and out of connection with the phone. Useless when trying to have a conversation. This is with a Motorola phone! The sound was poor both listening and with others listening to me. They could barely hear me because of any background noise would drown out my voice. This was when the microphone was carefully positioned for optimal sound. The ergonomics are questionable for functional use because one of the sound problems related the the position of the microphone on the \"boom\" of the headset.

Therefore, covering the microphone rendering it useless to having a normal conversation.\n\nThe reason I gave it 2 stars. The battery lasted a long time and it was easy to use with the buttons.

But for whatever reason, since then the volume is perfectly clear and loud and I have yet to have any problem hearing anyone else nor them hearing me.  I do think the Jabra defaults to a mid-volume level when turned on each time, but I turn it up and it is plenty loud for my needs.\n\n* Functionality:  Easy to answer and end a call as well as redial.  I have not yet set up the voice dialing but given how well everything else has worked I expect this to function well, too.  (If not, I will update my comments!)\n\n* Style:  Okay, everyone who wears these things tends to look a bit weird regardless of brand, size or style IMO.

For me, I have verizon cell phones operating in the 800MHZ cell band in my area.  In my house we had zero to 1 bar and could make calls but they were frequently dropped or cut in and out.  We could walk down the block and the signal was better.  Our house sits in a depression and most of the cell signal was going over the top of our house.\n\nTo really make this thing work well I would recommend the following tips:\n\n1)  Get cell phone for which you know how to enable DEBUG mode and get an actual NUMBER for the signal strength it is receiving.\n\n2)  Go ahead and purchase the optional YAGI directional antenna for this unit.\n\n3)  Buy an approximately 4 x 8 ft. piece of radiant barrier ( a type of insulation available at home depot made of aluminum).\n\n4)  Mount YAGI antenna in rafters of house or outside on roof.\n\n5)  Mount cell extender about 3 feet from the floor in the top living level of your house in a center location of the house.\n\n6)  Place radiant barrier in attick directly between the 2 antennas.  This will help improve the signal separation a lot and will make this thing work.\n\n7)  Power up cell extender.  If when you power it up you get ANY flashing amber lights, then your signal isolation between the two antennas isn't good enough and you must do something about it (move antennas, get YAGI with higher gain, etc.)  If you get no amber lights on startup then the device is operating at max or almost max amplification and power output (only 1/2 watt but plenty for a single house).\n\nWe now have 3-5 bars all over our house, deck, porch, and even garage!  Calls are clear and there is no breaking up or dropping of calls.\n\nWe have 2700 sq ft. house with 2 stories plus a basement.  I am using a 10dbi antenna from some guys out of New York I found on the internet.  I paid $99 for this antenna because they told me it was a 17dbi antenna, but they lied.

For better or worse, my Treo has become an intregal part of how I do business. It works (usually seamlessly) with my Microsoft Outlook and calendar (My phone vibrates 15 minutes prior to all of my meetings). My Outlook contact list (and all of those phone numbers!) are instantly transferred into the phone's contact list- it really has revolutionized the way I organize all of my business trips! On a trip I list all of my visits, agendas, contacts and directions into my Outlook account and presto they are linked straight into the Treo and available to me while I am on the road.\n\nOther features-\n- Internet connectivity - sure it is \"watered down\" webpages, but it does give me pitch-by-pitch updates on my favorite baseball games!\n-Pocket versions of Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint\n- The camera is surprisingly good!

I was rebooting the 6700 on a daily basis, if not more, but this I reboot probably once a week, if not less.\n\nThe thing I use this for the most, other than tracking contacts and my calendar, is checking Email.  I check five eMail addresses on a regular basis and this is quite flawless.  I can customize each account a certain way and I've never had problems picking up eMail... even with one of them being behind a firewall I have to VPN into first.  No problem!!\n\nThe integration with Office and Windows is fantastic, especially since the OS on this phone is by Microsoft.  Palm has still not updated their sync program for Windows Vista so having Microsoft's support on this is extremely helpful.\n\nI like the front screen better than the Palm version in that I see information (upcoming appointments, past do items on my to-do list, messages) instead of being presented with program icons that I more likely don't use.  I've added on some software that makes this even more presentable.\n\nThe keypad works great, though I do wish they had a colon as a button.  it has a semi-colon but to put in a colon I have to bring up the on-screen keyboard and select it there.  Looking at the screen, they could have done it, and I'm a bit baffled why they chose not to.\n\nThe screen is vibrant and colorful.  It isn't as large as the 6700's but I rarely miss the larger size.  It is a touchscreen and that works without any issues.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the battery life.  But they at least had the wisdom to make the battery removable so you can carry around a spare.  If you don't have a spare, expect to charge it daily if you use it often enough.  For slight usage (in which case, what is the point) you can probably get away with charging every other night.\n\nThis is missing one thing... Wi-Fi.  How could that have been forgotten?!?!

If you're a former Palm PDA user, you'll hate this as a PDA (and probably as a phone as well).  My company recently switched from the Blackberry platform to Windows Mobile.  For secrity reasons, the only device initially approved for use on the WM platform is the Treo 700W, so I had no choice but to go with this dog.  It tries to do everything but ends up doing nothing well.  My review will focus on a comparison with the Blackberry platform (I was using a 7290).\n\nCons, compared to the BB:\n\n-- Small cramped keyboard with clumsy dome-shaped keys that are much slower and more cumbersome to use, and which impede accurate typing.\n\n-- Awkward implementation of shift and function keys; one major flaw is that the only way to type a capital letter is to use the shift key; you can't simply hold down a letter key until it produces a capital, as you can on the BB.\n\n-- Predictive typing is virtually useless.  It seldom produces the most obvious word, i.e., the one you'd expect.  Accidentally type a nonstandard spelling (easy to do, since it's so hard to type on this keyboard), and the prediction feature will repeat the new \"word\" until you select a similar word with different spelling.\n\n-- Extremely cluttered interface.  Doing just about anything involves navigating menus, and there's no scroll wheel, so you can't do it one-handed: you have to use the stylus.\n\n-- Using the address book to dial a number is painful.  Type in the first letter of a person's name - say \"D\" - and you'll get every name that begins with that letter, whether a first name or last name.  To pick the name you actually want, you then have to navigate the list with the stylus.  It's just a mess.\n\n-- Instability.  I have to reset the device 2 - 3 times a day; it constantly hangs.\n\n-- The combination of the touch screen and the placement of too-sensitive volume keys on the side means that something unintentional is always happening on the screen (and with the phone).  Try to place this in a leather holster (or extract it), and odds are you'll have changed the volume while simultaneously having switched to one of the multi-layered screens several levels down.  It other words, pull this thing out of a belt clip or holster and you'll probably have to pull out the stylus and close a succession of two or three screens just to get back to the main \"Today\" screen (which is incredibly cluttered and counterintuitive).\n\n-- Battery life is pathetic.  Plan on having this plugged into a charger whenever possible.  With luck, you might make it through one day of use, IF you don't make or receive any phone calls but instead just use it to check your e-mail and calendar.  It's that bad.\n\nPros:\n\n-- The footprint is more phone-like than a traditional Blackberry.\n\nOnce the Motorola Q is approved for service by my company, I plan to unload this dog and buy one of those.

Unfortunately it does neither very well...", "unixReviewTime": 1153526400}, {"overall": 2.0, "vote": "17", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2006", "reviewerID": "A2906N9V5I3H6H", "asin": "B000E6MFXA", "reviewerName": "Michael SEO", "reviewText": "I've owned virtually every Treo since Handspring sold the ingenious device to Palm and unfortunately the company and its executives have done nothing but milk every dollar they can for their bonuses and kill the franchise in the process. I really wanted to like this phone and tried every workaround. Unfortunately it goes back later today for many of the reasons Alfredo Gomez refers to. Other than a reasonably good form factor and hardware - which other companies have now caught up - Palm has made very few changes. DO NOT BELIEVE MOST MAGAZINE REVIEWS -- they are half done hack jobs by people who barely use the phone and write up their experience on specs and a day of usage. It's not the normal experience and I will explain.\n\n1) Just not enough RAM -\n\nIf you are in any way using this phone as anything more than just pulling an email account and occasional surfing, this phone is not for you. In addition to Microsoft themselves recommending 64MB of RAM and the fact that EVERY PDA and phone for the past year and a half has at LEAST 64 MB of RAM, Palm foolishly decided to go with HALF that number -- the same 32 MB of RAM that was available to users in their Treo 600 released in 2002!!! This was greed. With Windows Mobile this even more of a problem because it was built to multitask -- keep your applications open in the background and called to the front on request. Opening and closing bulky applications is SLOW in Windows Mobile. With the 700w you get about 14MB of RAM to run applications before you put in the necessary minimal add ons, which will reduce your memory by at least 1-2 MB. But the real problem are memory leaks in WM 5 which will reduce that number even more. Add the fact that the 700w will QUIT applications when you get to the 5MB level, this will mean that your device will not multitask and you might have 2 apps open at the same time, maybe even 3 if they are not memory intensive. If you have open your email program and may have surfed using Pocket IE recently then opening your contact manager like PocketInformant will take you at least 5-10 seconds. You will hate that rotating colored ball. THIS CANNOT BE CHANGED as there are no RAM upgrades. I need to reset the phone at least once a day to clear the RAM.\n\n2) SMS and Email problems: If you will use SMS or email frequently, this phone can make you pull your hair out. There is a bug (feature?) in SMS and PocketOutlook where scrolling down means the cursor goes to the bottom of the page view. Thus if you have a 14 line email or document you are editing, the only way to get to line 5 is to whip out that stylus or scrolling a few hundred characters to the right until you get there. Unfortunately the same goes for SMS which is NOT THREADED. This means that you can't see the ongoing conversation you may have with different people. It is by date, end of story. There aren't any suitable alternatives right now unfortunately. Nothing for SMS and the best email program I have seen is Web IS Flexmail which itself requires several keypresses just to delete an email -- unless once again you want to whip out that stylus. One handed operation is better than other WM devices but NOT EVEN CLOSE to the ease of using the Palm OS.\n\n3. 240x240 screen is barely adequate if you use the web and infuriating with the limited number of apps that work with the 700w. On a whole it's better than I thought and not really a problem for most apps that use this resolution. Reading ebooks is a tad fuzzy but perfectly acceptable, even at smaller fonts. But squeeze that IE page into your tiny screen and the little fonts will be illegible. Want to view a power point for example? A word doc you received in email? With a 240x320 you see just enough to view a whole page and make it out. Not so with 240x240. It's just a little too coarse and you have to zoom everything. It's also a lot of info to cram into that tiny screen.\n\n3) Windows Mobile has advantages and nice things about it but it is still NOT an optimal OS for mobile use. It is amazing that many tasks still require you to use a stylus or take an absurd number of keypresses. For example, if you want to simply save a number in your phone log you can just navigate and save. You must pull out the stylus, point and hold, and wait for save as to appear. Sure this isn't horrific but it becomes very noticeable when you do this regularly. If you ever used a Palm OS phone you will wish you could go back. Knowing Palm they will not improve the system in time and in a year or two Microsoft will FINALLY get this right.\n\nWiFi is OK but very weak and almost useless with the external card. Bluetooth is adequate.\n\nOn the pros the battery life is reasonably good. Form factor is ok and the build quality is better than other phones like the xv6700. The screen clarity and contrast is also very good. As a phone it is acceptable.\n\nSo the end result is that unless you are a basic user that only wants to check an email account, doesn't get a lot of email, doesn't use SMS much, doesn't really use the PDA much, then this phone is not a solution for you. It will be nice to experience for the first 2 weeks and then you will begin to see the problems tear you apart soon after becoming familiar with the phone. It is sad that virtually all of these problems can be traced to Palm executives greed on trying to milk out just one more sale from an old phone that had a form factor that was the best for a long time. At this day and age consumers have a choice and need for more than just a phone that feels good in your hand. Don't be stupid. If Microsoft recommends that any application they provide needs 64 MB of RAM there is nobody stupid enough to even try to run it with less. That is the Palm Treo 700w.", "summary": "Palm = Yesterday's Technology in a Good Form Factor", "unixReviewTime": 1149120000}, {"overall": 1.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2006", "reviewerID": "A2WLDEORTNRY0D", "asin": "B000E6MFXA", "reviewerName": "SBJ400", "reviewText": "This was a nice try by Palm and I never thought they would actually use any other OS besides their own.\n\nOverall, this phone had potential but it falls DRASTICALLY short in 5 areas!\n\n1 - the builtin Bluetooth sucks.\n\nIt works and then it doesn't.

Definitely a very economical way to call home and call within Italy...10 cents per min or so within Italy to other mobiles, and about 60 cents to call the USA.\n\nThis is a very basic phone, and many of the menus have leftover Cingular features which don't apply (for example, their now-defunct MEDIA NET).  However, the phone is a nice size, makes calls, receives calls, easy to adjust the ringer.  Comes with a manual, charger etc.\n\nA plus is that this phone uses the same mini usb charger as my Blackberry Curve 8310 so I can just carry one charger abroad!\n\nI would recommend this phone for travel/vacation use.  For constant use, you might want a phone with more features and less Cingular-legacy branding.\n\nHope this helps!

In lieu of a decent, nonflip, bluetooth/camera phone w/ Tmobile I went with this phone. Friends and strangers alike say: ooh how pretty. I say ...\n\nPros:\n1. 1.3 Mp camera\n2. Bluetooth\n3. most vivid clear screen I've seen on a cell\n4. good form factor\n5. opens & closes very well well (1st edition I had was a little clunky, had a Samsung China sticker on the inside, 2nd edition I had (replaced due to bad mic) doesn't have a manufacturer's tag)\n6. far better reception inside buildings than my previous SE T610 (w/ Tmo)\n7. camera has great & funny options such as cartoon bubbles and image overlays which all my friends think are hilarious thereby enhancing the blackmail potential or storytelling function of my phone's camera - good times! This little feature is silly, but makes me smile so much; if all features of the phone made me smile like this, I would have kept this phone.\n\nCons:\n1. lack of customizability\n - no \"favorites/shortcuts\"\n - soft keys cannot be changed\n - cannot use .3gp files or .mp3 files as ring tones (on 1st handset (which I had for 3 weeks but which Tmo replaced due to a microphone problem) I could, on 2nd handset, this functionality was gone! I understand Tmo locks this functionality so you have to buy ringtones from them, whatevs Tmo!)\n2. lack of functionality\n - menu inaccessable during calls (cannot text or surf during calls)\n - no airplane mode\n - no notes function\n - poor Mac supprt\n - - does not work with Mac iSync (although, you can send numbers to phone from Mac Address Book (Menu: Card > Send card) via Bluetooth, which is at least some convenience, but not the convenience of iSync)\n - - my Mac OS 10.2.8 and OS 10.4.6 computers are unable to use dial up networking via Bluetooth or USB cable (despite the EDGE functionality and the claims of the sweet T-mobile techies who I don't believe)\n - - Bluetooth (via my Mac) only browses the memory card as far as I can tell, eg, sees pics only in the memory card\n3. GUI isn't well thought out - menu navigation difficult, sending text message requires a number of button pushes once the text is done (sending a text to multiple people is a major chore), finding files is not intuitive, submenus with similar functions are dissimilar between different apps (compare to the \"File\" menu on all Windows programs, it's the same because it makes thins easier, Samsung hasn't figured this little design STANDARD out)\n4. 1.3 Mp camera makes 17-40 kb sized pics ... WTF?!?\n5. problem with microSD card staying firmly inserted, aftermarket purchased card (necessary for music or multiple pics) pops out\n\nI will not buy a Samsung phone again. My phone MUST sync immediately and completely with whatever computer I have whether Mac, Windows, or Linux; currently the one I have is a Mac. Hello: Mac, Samsung, communitcate!! My previous phone, the SE T610, synched its contact list flawlessly to my Mac. The Samsung t809 database file type is currently incompatible with iSync. Don't believe claims on this or other websites saying the t809 sync's with Macs.\n\nEvery single Samsung product (phones, home entertainment, etc) I have bought in the past 3 years has looked pretty and been supposedly loaded with features. However, each was loaded with glitches. No more Samsung for me!\n\nWish I had gotten a RAZR (free or nearly so with Tmo), held out for a Motorola Capri, or splurged and gotten a fabulous unlocked Nokia (every one I've had has been outstanding).\n\nUPDATE as of November 2006:\nThe phone is not as sturdy as I had assumed. After having placed the intact phone in my cargo pants pocket, squatting down while painting and standing back up, the phone stopped playing the mp3 I was blaring with the nice loud speaker. I took the phone out of the pocket and HORRORS! the inside/backside screen was cracked (the one inside the casing I guess) which voided the warranty since the Tmo warranty doesn't apply to cracked screens.

I've wanted a slider for a while, saw the T809, researched it and got it to replace my beloved Motorola V-300 which, after three years was startin' to act up.  The keys are flat and small and takes some gettin' used to.  At 1st, I thought I'd have to remove the phone from its case and slide open I wanted to do anything...and that got tired real fast.  Fortunately, this is not the case. You can answer the phone just by hitting the \"dial/menu confirm\" key on the outside of the phone.  To end the call, just hit the \"power on/off/menu exit\" key. You can go to slider options and program it so that it's convenient for you.  You can use the slider to answer and end calls or you can have the slider have no effect what so ever on calls.  You can do the same stuff with the slider down as you can with the slider up/open.  Difference is, it's much quicker with the slider open as you can use shortcuts.  When you close the slider, you'll have the option to \"lock\" it or not.  To unlock, just hit the left and right soft keys in that order.  Soon you'll be doin' it without any thought. There's a volume key on the side of the phone.  The volume's pretty loud both on and off speaker.  Sometimes, I even have to turn the phone volume down cos the caller comes through too loud!  Another thing about the sound, with my V-300, I could barely hear my mp3 ringtones.  Not so with the T809.  You can also adjust how you want your silent alert (vibrate or mute). To put T809 on silent, just press and hold the # key.  Unlike my Motorola V-300, I don't have to wait for the call to connect before I'm able to activate the speaker.\nThe camera's 1.3 mega pixels, but that ain't the kicker.  It's what you can do with the pictures you take.  You can edit an image with the following options: None (leaves you with a regular lookin' photo), Black & White (self explanatory), Negative (looks like a negative), Sepia (classic lookin', brown tint), Blur (self explanatory), Sharp (s.e.), Sketch (looks like an artist sketched it with pencil), Posterize (I can't even explain this one.  Just gives it a slightly different look) & Solarize (this really looks artsy!).  There are even a variety of picture \"frames\" that you can use to decorate your photos.\nAs for the video cam, you can get a good 20-30 seconds of footage.  Speakin' of videos, there's  a music video on this phone!  I just gotta find out how and where to get some more!  Lemme find out I could be watchin' Duran Duran on my cell phone, whaaaaat!  Anywho, I'm not interested in using it as an MP3 cos I have an MP3...that I use as an MP3.\nAlso, I thought I could only get Yahoo.  Silly me.  I have several URL Favorites saved (Yahoo, MSN, BBC, GOOGLE, MAPQUEST, SUPERPAGES).  You can store up to 10 URL's.  I check my Yahoo and MSN mail easily (but I can't open attachments).  There seem to be more MP3 ringtones available to me with this phone.  As for games, I guess they're updating constantly.  Pac-Man wasn't available when I first got the phone, but it is now.  I'm just waiting for my Backgammon to be available on this phone.  I also like that you can turn the calendar \"on\" and have it display on your wallpaper.  Turn it \"off\" and you just have your wallpaper photo.  Yes, you can make your own photos your wallpaper too.  Yes, you can have different ringtones and photos for each caller.\nOkee doke, I think I've taken up enough time.  Just wanted to leave my $0.02 end ended up writing the sequel to \"War & Peace\".  Hope this helps anyone considering gettin' the Samsung T-809.  :)\n\nUPDATE!\nI've had my T809 for over a year now and I'd just like to add a little somethin'...\nWhile with all of its bells and whistles, the T809 is still very much wicked and relevant. Unfortunately, after the first few months the battery life began to decline (okay, nosedive is more like it!). A few months ago, I'd purchased a new battery and it has made no difference, so it must be the phone itself. I'm on the verge of purchasing a new phone as the battery life in my T809 only lasts about 4 hours on some days. As a result, I have to carry my charger everywhere. And I couldn't help but notice that T-Mobile doesn't even carry/offer this model anymore. Hmmm...\n\nGreat phone, but what good are the myriad of features if the darn thing won't work when you need it? I'm trying to hold out until there's more feedback regarding the Motorola RIZR Z3. That's the next phone I've got my eye on.

Not got it yet. But I like the phone.\n\nFirst off, phone performance:\n\nPhone reception is fine - SF Bay area.\n\nSound quality: Like a normal cell phone. No echoes, boominess or any such thing.\n\nBattery life: 2-3 days per charge with bluetooth on and about an hour of use, rest on standby and fiddling around with the screen at full brightness. I think that is reasonable based on the previous phones I have had.\n\nUsablity as a phone: Depends.\n\nTo carry around: I feel this is not one to carry around in a pocket with the screen unprotected. Why? The screen is highly polished and I am concerned it might get scratched easily and then look not so cool. Has not happened in my few days of usage, however.\n\nTo receive calls: Its neat. You don't have to open the sucker, just set up any-key answer and you can use it in its closed state. Infact, you can set it up to shut off its screen after 30 seconds, so it looks fascinating to be speaking into this sleek black thing with no lights and mostly no buttons showing.\n\nTo make calls: almost as neat. You don't have to open it to access previously called numbers - just hit the green button, up pop the numbers, scroll to the right one and hit the dial button. Nice. Almost the same deal with the phone book. Unfortunately, to dial a number NOT in your phone book, you DO have to get at the numbers, and show the dial pad. Oh well.\n\nBluetooth setup for headset: Simple. Couple buttons did the trick\n\nfor me.\n\nScreen visibility: Phenominal. Best I have seen so far, even when it is dimmed down to 30% brightness when most other phones screens are looking really washed out. You can use it as a part-time flashlight instead of stumbling your way around at night, its that bright. And of course, when it goes into battery saver mode, the screen goes jet black - very cool. Not a wimpy gray or blue. Nice fonts.\n\nOther stuff:\n\nRings. The one they give is, well, lets just say there is room for improvement. YOu can download others, or hook it up to a computer, throw in some midi files and use those.\n\nGames: Yes, but that is not my criteria when buying a phone.\n\nWashing machine/dishwasher/mouse trap capability: No. Its a phone.\n\nComputer interface: Piece of cake. With a USB connection - you need to install the drivers first, and the documentation sucks - I installed it as a precaution. You can drag and drop files - photos, mp3 and midi tracks to convert to your ring tone (mp3 files suffix needs to be changed, though), probably even word docs and spreadsheets if you must - if you want to use it as a temporary external storage device.\n\nSamsung software: umm, same deal as the supplied ring tone. Room for improvement. Considerable room, actually.\n\nComments: The Java applets, flashing lights and monkey tricks lose their charm very quickly. Have not yet figured out how to stop the circus.

Diaz", "reviewText": "Synopsis:  This phone is sexy, rugged and feature-packed, and highly recommended, if you can look past its few flaws.\n\nDetail:  I'm a veteran to the RAZR line, having purchased one of the first black models when they were first released.  I thought the phone was excellent then, but with a few minor revisions, Motorola has brought the RAZR back to the forefront of the rapidly-moving world of mobile phones.  However, there are a few notable exceptions to this glowing report.\n\nFirst, the pros of the V3i model.  The call quality is somewhat better than the original V3, which already had exceptional sound clarity and reception in my experience with it.  Staying with the quad-band format is one of the best decisions that Motorola could have made with this phone- for individuals like me who travel abroad frequently, having a phone that can be used Stateside and overseas is an absolute must.\n\nThe Bluetooth interface is seamless, but I use a Motorola H3 headset- if you use a headset of a different brand, you could encounter some difficulties, although I've not heard of any.  The camera, now 1.2 megapixels, takes (quite frankly) amazing photos for a mobile phone.  My wife decided to keep the pictures I took of our newborn son, as opposed to the pictures that were shot with our digital camera.  The video capture feature is good too, although I don't usually find myself using this function too frequently.\n\nHaving the ability to switch to an \"Airplane Safe\" mode is also a plus, as you can still use the games and MP3 player while on a long flight.  Obviously, however, you won't be able to send or receive calls or data while the phone's in this mode.  The switch between these two modes, however, takes less than half a second.\n\nThe physical size of the phone is also a major plus.  It's still a comfortable size to fit in your hand, but it's thin enough to easily fit into the front pocket of a pair of jeans.  The fit and finish are top shelf, the iridescent silver outside (seems to change to a smoke and a purple in different lights) contrasts well with the sleek black of the interior of the clamshell.  The outside display is bright and clear, and the interior screen is also bright and easy to read.  The keypad I find to be very good, but some people don't go for the feel of the cut metal keys.  Personal taste, I guess...\n\nMotorola's operating system is, in my opinion, clear and intuitive.  I've never found a system to be easier- the only one that's been nearly as easy was Nokia's, to give a perspective.  Icons are easy to interpret, commands are simple to issue to the phone, and with the TransFlash card installed, there's only a theoretical limit to the number of photos or videos you can store and take with you in your pocket.\n\nAs I mentioned, though, there are some chinks in the armor.  First, the iTunes format is clunky and slow to navigate through.  Your iPod defintely moves through the menus much more quickly than does this phone.  Also, regardless of the size of the TransFlash card you have installed, iTunes limits the number of songs you can store to 50.  I've heard that some later models have this limit removed (or at least increased), but my version caps the fun at 50 songs.  Also, while the external speaker sounds good, I forego using the Motorola stereo headphones due to their poor sound quality.  Obviously, when I'm at the gym or on a transatlantic flight, I rely on my iPod for musical entertainment.\n\nAnother con is the lack of EDGE or 3G technology on this phone.  Cingular is currently offering a 3G RAZR with many of these features (having iTunes replaced with Motorola's proprietary DAP MP3 player and no song limit), but sadly that phone is a tri-band model.  The download speeds are comparable to a 56K dial-up home connection, but many of us are now using cable or DSL at home, and at work using a T1/T3 connection, which makes downloading data from the Internet on my phone seem slow and cumbersome.\n\nOverall, this phone is one of the best on the market today.  I was a convert with the first RAZR, and with its subtle upgrades and refinements, the V3i is truly a worthy successor to the original.  However, with its few flaws, I'm still anxiously awaiting the \"perfect\" RAZR to be released from Motorola's braintrust.

Since my Sony Ericsson S710a didn't work out, and since my wife's V3 has been solid so far, I decided to give Moto one more chance with the V3i.\n\nFirst, the build quality and materials are EXCELLENT. The machined aluminum outer casing, and machined nickel keypad, provide substantial heft (this is good) and tactility. Moto could've used a little better plastic in places, but it's fine otherwise.\n\nSecond, although its resolution is lower than the S710a's, the V3i inner display's physical screen size is about the same. Meaning it's plenty large, not to mention clear, colorful, and bright. The outer display is nothing special, but it is a compromise for better battery life, so I can live with that.\n\nThird, unlike Sony Ericsson, the new Moto's (V3i, SLVR L7, etc.) sport an industry-standard mini-USB charging/data port, and use standard memory cards. (I put a 1GB TransFlash in mine and it is amazing.) No more proprietary chargers and cables, nor goofy Sony-only \"Memory Sticks.\"\n\nFourth, the Bluetooth. Motorola has come a long way to improve their implementation, and though it is not as full featured as Sony Ericsson's, it is almost unshakable in its stability. (Sony Ericsson has the reverse trend. The T616 had great Bluetooth, the S710a's was unstable. The new W600 and W900 are equally unstable.) Range is excellent, too.\n\nFifth, reception and call quality are both excellent. Volume could be better, but is still adequate. I have to admit, though, that the S710a was slightly better with earpiece and speakerphone audio volume and quality.\n\nFinally, the much maligned UI. Yes, Sony Ericsson trumps everyone with their interface and Address Book; Motorola executes both of these rather clumsily, thus requiring a steep learning curve. However, two areas where Moto outshines Sony Ericsson are 1) consistent UI responsiveness and 2) broad customizability.\n\nMy only other gripe is the 50 song limit in iTunes, even with the memory card upgrade. However, I'm an iPod owner, so this doesn't concern me too much.\n\nNow for a word of warning to Mac users. My iTunes-equipped V3i, unlocked and unbranded, came from an overseas market (phone and manual languages included UK English, Vietnamese, Bhasat, and Thai). It has full Bluetooth functionality with my Mac, including iSync. However, some V3i's don't work over Bluetooth - the Mac can't \"see\" any of the phone's services, thus preventing file transfers or iSync-ability without a USB connection. I can't say for sure if this is related to iTunes or not, but so far it seems the iTunes-loaded V3i's work better.

Having said that, it would be nice if they'd somehow talked HTC into making this phone more WAP-compatible so you could use TZones instead of JUST the Total Internet plan, since there's a $23/month difference in price..but that's OK, really, because the WiFi is very good. In fact, I've discovered numerous free hotspots around my home town that I didn't know about until I had this phone!\n\nTMobile's phone reception in this area is fine, better than my Cingular reception generally, though with a few weak areas that seem to be weak no matter what carrier you've got. The phone also syncs nicely with an Exchange Server I have set up (one of the main reasons I got it-Windows Mobile 5), and of course is great for appointments/calendar/contacts (and email even without the internet plan IF you've got an Exchange Server; but it does web-based email fine too) and pc sync of all types with Windows pc's via ActiveSync. The ClearVue software that's included does a decent job viewing (but NOT editing) Word and pdf files too. I'll soon have an SD card to add some storage capacity for more of those. Tried the camera, it's pretty mediocre, but not a priority for me anyway.\n\nDrawbacks: yes, the dialpad is small, and you really have to get used to the keys and ESPECIALLY the joystick, but it's OK after a few days. I'd just as soon they'd made the Windows Media buttons smaller and increased the size of the other ones, but it does seem to do well with .wmv files..\n\nExtras: The WiFi and the screen make for surprisingly good web browsing!

This phone has completely blown away my expectations of a cell phone.  I migrated over from Verizon and an LG VX6700.  As far as service/reception and customer service, T-Mobile absolutely blows away Verizon.  With Verizon, it seemed everyone gave you a different answer.  But on to the phone...\n\nPros:\n\n1) So easy to set-up e-mail.  It took maybe 5 minutes to set up my work's Exchange Server information.  There are so many options to set how the e-mail comes in (attachments, headers only, etc.)\n\n2) The little hump at the top for this US version of the phone where the internal antenna is housed makes for EXCELLENT reception.  I thought I had it great with my LG, but I honestly have not ever had a problem except for a known dead zone in a rural part of my state.\n\n3) Camera/Video.  I don't really care too much about quality, it's a cell phone!  But I do like how easy it is to manage.  I got a 256mb MicroSD memory card and set up all my photos/videos to be directly stored to it.  It stores things in a folder format based on the date.  With a few button presses I can send any pictures/videos right off to Textamerica for posting through e-mail.\n\n4) Syncing.  I have it set up to sync with my home desktop, work laptop, and exchange server.  It was a little tricky at first, but with Bluetooth it's so easy and I've been very pleased.\n\n5) Light sensing.  I've always thought it was a waste of battery for a keyboard to lit up in the middle of the day, this phone has the ability to sense light and will turn on the back-lit numpad if its dark.\n\n6) Size.  I thought my LG was decently small, but this is actually much thinner and almost the same length if you factor in the antenna which always protrudes from any Verizon phone.  Fits perfectly in a front pocket, you don't feel like you have a big bulge protruding from your front pocket.\n\nCons:\n\n1) The keypad.  This seems to come up a lot, it was a little bad at first, but I've grown to learn how to use the best.  I don't mind it at all anymore (had phone for about 2 months now).  It's a small compromise to have such a slim-size.  If it's necessary for text a lot during your day, then get a qwerty-phone.  I've had no problems though spouting out text messages or e-mails, just takes a few seconds longer than a qwerty-phone, and of course, T9 makes it pretty easy.\n\n2) Initial Battery life.  I was pretty let down at first with the battery life.  You do need to let it go through a few full battery cycles of full-charge to dead to get the battery \"normal\" I guess.  I use the phone A LOT throughout my day and usually get about 3 days worth on a full charge.  With the ease of availability on eBay of cheap cell phone batteries, this isn't too much of a concern.\n\nThings I don't know about:\n\nMusic.  I don't use a cell phone to listen to music, I think it's kind of silly.  My 60GB iPod can do a much better job at it, as that is it's main purpose.  So I have no knowledge of this aspect of the phone.\n\nIf you're torn between something like this, and a full-size QWERTY smartphone, just evaluate how much text input you want to do and if you want to carry a rather large blackberry with you when you are out and about or something much slimmer and smaller.  I would go with T-Mobile regardless of your phone choice.  Their award-winning customer service just makes the experience.  Verizon is good though.

But it is far from perfect.\n\nValue\nOne thing that consistently prevented me from buying Cingular's Audiovox SMT5600 was the outdated version of the OS, the data plan required for the rebates, the 2 year contract, and the fact that Cingular really does not make it easy for existing customers to get a deal that's comparable to what new subscribers get. T-Mobile has showed me a way out. A 1 year contract, no problem with transfering 2 numbers from Cingular, and a device running Windows Smartphone 2005 was all it took to say good bye.\n\nCool Features\nI wanted a device that (besides running my Windows Mobile apps) is a phone, an MP3 player, syncs my calendar and contacts, and receives emails. I don't care much about watching movies or taking pictures with this device, so I won't comment on that. The phone part is just ok - reception is generally lower than with my previous Cingular phone. On a train ride from Boston to NYC there were only a few select spots with enough coverage to make a call, but not for long enough to have a conversation. I thoroughly miss a calling card management function. I can use a calling card by typing in the call-in number, my code and the actual number, separated by waits, into the contact information (it allows for enough characters to do that), but then my calling card information is unproteced. I use a calling card for international calls and the lack of this feature is a nuisance. My old Nokia had a really intelligent solution for it.\nMP3 works ok - the volume is too low for me to really enjoy the music. The Windows Media player does its job, though.\nThis thing's strength is no doubt that it has so many connectivity features. The options are Wifi, Bluetooth and IR. I have not used IR, just started experimenting with Bluetooth, and already mastered Wifi. I did not get a data plan for this phone, and it looks like I will not need one. The reason is that I can connect to both my company's exchange server and my personal POP3 email accounts whenever there is Wifi available. ActiveSync configured the Outlook client to connect to the Exchange Server's Web Services interface - which means that I did not have to solve the VPN client problem to connect to Exchange directly (the SDA supports only MS VPN - PPTP or IPSec - natively, but my company uses Cisco and Citrix). This really impressed my CIO. He did not know that he is already supporting Smartphone 2005 clients.\nThe Wifi support works fine - I was able to connect to my home Wifi that does not broadcast a SID and uses WEP. It took me 1 hour on the phone with support to find the place where the WEP key is configured, but once that was pointed out to me it worked right away. Wifi is my favorite feature - but only when the phone is plugged in to a power source.\nThe POP3 clent does seem to support the \"leave mail on server\" option that Outlook 2003 has. Thus, the email that goes to my phone disappears and I cannot archive it on my home PC. With IMAP I don't have this particular problem, but then I cannot delete emails (they would disappear from the server) and the inbox becomes difficult to manage.\n\nUsability Issues\nAs others have observed, the fact that the task manager is the only way to terminate running applications is a real oddity. It is like building a car that does not have a reverse gear. How did this slip through the usability tests?\nI also experienced that the joystick is somewhat difficult to handle. Because of its miniature size it only takes a very small sideways pressure to make the intended click a scroll.\nThe keys are small. Someone with large hands would not be able to use the phone. Using the fingernails works, but you better not cut them too short.\nEven with Bluetooth and Wifi turned off, the battery life is anything but impressive. The screen draws a lot of juice. I have to recharge the phone daily.\nAnother small annoyance: there seems to be no backslash character available, which is needed to form a fully qualified user id in the format domain\\userid (some software does not support the alternative format with the @ symbol).\n\nSummary\nSmartphone 2005 edition is a very promising platform for this kind of device. The SDA shows where the technology is heading and gives you a glimpse of the powerful features that will be common in a few years. Today, I still get the feeling that the hardware is not quite ready for the software (a reminder of the early versions of MS Windows, particularily 2.0 and 3.1 - always ahead of the hardware by one or two generations). This is especially true for the power consumption and battery life. Nevertheless, the phone is a keeper. Please add a 'cancel' or 'exit' option to the application menues, and add support for calling cards.\n\nUpdate 4/17: If you plan to write applications for Windows Smartphone 2005, be prepared to dive into the Smartphone security model. The phone is initially application-locked, which means that you cannot deploy code to the device. You will need to get a registry editor and change the security policies. Documentation is plentyful on the web. Unlocking the phone was a breeze - don't pay the 100's of $ for an unlocked SDA.\n\nUpdate 5/5: I am inclined to take the \"many little annoyances\" back.

Russo", "reviewText": "I really, really wanted to like this phone.  I use a dialup POP account to access the web (from an old Treo 270) and bought this phone because it allows dialup IP connections where the Treo 650 doesn't.  I'd originally purchased a 650 and returned it because it prevents you from accessing the web via dialup (as soon as you put in the SIM card, it defaults to T-Mobile's GPRS network and locks out any other type of internet connection).\n\nUnfortunately, the PocketPC interface is absolutely unintuitive as compared to the Palm OS.  Where the Palm may require one or two clicks to access something or intitiate a task, the PocketPC requires you go through very cumbersome menus in order to achieve the same actions.  Learning these menus is a real pain.  Even such simple items as exiting a program or function can be frustrating because the commands needed to do so will change depending on the application you may be running (something as basic as a close box will move location from one program to another).  \"How do I get out of this?\"  one app has a close box in the upper right hand of the screen, another app. requires you to access a menu and then close.  When using the phone, turning on the speakerphone requires going through two menus where in the Palm OS it's thoughtfully placed right on your main phone screen.\n\nThe slide out keyboard, although it looks cool- is very difficult to use.  Because the keys need to be flat in order to fit under the slide, they are not tactile enough to distinguish easily with your thumb, there is little resistance to activating them and it is very easy to press the wrong key unintentionally.  The stylus is laughably unusable as it's located on the bottom of the unit, is too small as well as being telescoping in a way where it's constantly collapsing as you try to use it.\n\nWhere the Treo has a physical exterior switch to go into vibrate or quiet mode, the MDA/KJAM requires you to go through at least 2 onscreen menus to turn off the ringer.  I bought a 1 Gig memory card for the unit but can't seem to get it to save pix or video to the card.  I'm sure there's a way to do it, but again it requires learning more unintuitive steps & configurations from the manual.  When talking on the phone it's very easy to touch the screen with your ear or face so that functions and applications accidentally launch.  It's processor is relatively slow and there is almost always a 2 second lag between launching something and being able to access it.\n\nThe WiFi does work very well and makes browsing a breeze. The screen is bright and clear.  Bluetooth is decent but sound quality suffers.  If your a techie who doesn't mind going through an extensive learning curve, the unit is as feature packed as you can get and more powerful than most other PDA/Phones on the market.  I also like the fact it uses a standard, non proprietary USB mini plug for synching and charging, making it possible to charge the unit with cables already on hand from other devices if necessary.\n\nIt's not a bad phone, but needs a lot of improvements before being something practical to use on a daily basis.  After coming from the Palm OS, PocketPC is kind of like eating at Dominos after growing up on NYC Pizza.", "summary": "Not bad, but not good.", "unixReviewTime": 1144195200}, {"overall": 2.0, "vote": "8", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2006", "reviewerID": "A5JLAU2ARJ0BO", "asin": "B000EM8REU", "reviewerName": "Old-and-Wise", "reviewText": "The MDA, designed and made by Taiwan's HTC, a leader in the Windows Mobile \"smart phone\" market (they seem to make all the WM phones sold in the U.S.), is really a cool concept.  It has a nice shape, a slide-out thumbboard that automatically turns the screen to landscape, and all the goodies that make up Windows Mobile: Pocket Office, Pocket IE, MSN Messenger, Windows Media Player 10, and tons of free software to download from the web.  Plus, it has wi-fi which works really well.\n\nI really wanted to like the MDA, as I decided not to get a Palm-based Treo due to severe syncing problems with Outlook (problems that were supposed to be fixed in the now-vaporware Palm OS 6 \"Cobalt\").  And I wanted to like T-Mobile because they are the only carrier out there that forces you on a one-year, not two-year, contract (and still gives you a rebate).  Anyway, after a few days I was sorely disappointed.  The problem lay entirely with the MDA's reception.  It was almost the same problem I had with the original Sidekick back in 2003.  The MDA's antenna was never able to grab a signal strong enough to make web surfing any close to being useable.  And it would constantly lose and hunt for signal.  It was frustrating to no end, even in the heart of Boston where a RAZR tmo phone had full reception.  I never got half the speed promised by EDGE, the 2.5G GSM data network.  Very, very disappointing.  Much, much worse than the EVDO services I had earlier this year tried with Sprint and Verizon.\n\nSummary: the MDA has all the potentials of a major league star except the ability/stamina to stick out for more than one inning.  It's a dud, thanks partly to HTC's poor antenna design and/or construction and partly to T-Mobile's poor EDGE and GPRS support.  If you can stand a two-year commitment, go with Sprint's PPC-6700, also made by HTC with the same sliding thumbboard design.

I need a mount that will work with my I phone in it's Otterbox case. The previous one, and this one, both have side arms that will grab the Otterbox. The second day I had the other brand, the phone holder snapped off in my hand as I tried to make a minor adjustment in the angle of the phone. DANG! That one went back, I got a refund. After reading many many reviews, I found that all of these windshield mount holders break, some more quickly than others. So I decided to purchase the cheapest one, to minimize my losses. I like this one pretty well. The arm is more flexible than the original one, and I am careful to try to grab the arm and the holder when I adjust the angle, but because this arm is more flexible, it's easier to adjust. This one will adjust to verticle or horizontal, and has a locking pin that works very nicely. Yes, it bounces more than the other item, but this one is going on two weeks and hasn't broken.

In a cold car, with the humidity level just right, if you are not properly in line with the earth's magnetic poles (yes, I am kidding) the touch screen simply does not react to touch. There seems to be a problem with the capacitance detection system, perhaps because the holder is attached to the windsheild glass, and it insulates the phone and holder from you and the capacitance of the car. I found that rubbing the neck of the holder up and down (which looks VERY strange in traffic and might get you arrested) sometimes would create a capacitive differential. I finally figured out that plugging the phone in to it's charger properly grounded it, and I don't have touch detection problems when it is attached to the charger. But if you don't plug your phone into the charger, you will find that, at times, the phone simply does not detect your inputs, and that is VERY frustrating indeed.", "summary": "Good unit, but with a MYSTERY", "unixReviewTime": 1267747200}, {"overall": 1.0, "vote": "3", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2010", "reviewerID": "A24E6LQU5NHJTJ", "asin": "B000FCCDTO", "reviewerName": "JoeTechie", "reviewText": "Bought this so I could use my GPS feature on my iPhone...worked well for the first day until I decided to move the mount to a different spot on my windshield.

That's even including the new \"Pearl\" that includes a camera function.\n\nIf you really need a multi-fuction business oriented smartphone you're very likely going to need email access, a somewhat larger screen (larger than what you get on a regular cell), a qwerty keyboard, and reception that compares to a good cell phone.\n\nThe Blackberry Pearl has a smaller screen and keyboard.  The SDA has those problems plus a poor reaction time when leaving and entering coverage areas.  The MDA is just a bad cell phone.  (And let's not even talk about the Sidekick.) The Blackberry 7100t has the smaller keyboard and is simply a less powerful and slower smartphone.\n\nAs of late 2006, if you're on T-Mobile and you need a smartphone to access the Internet and email, this is the one to have.  I say this even with the \"soon to be released\" 7130 which I believe is faster, but still more like the 7100t in terms of limited functionality.\n\nWith that said, the 8700g does have its flaws.  Some minor and one very big one.\n\nWhile the reception of the 8700g is very good - better than some of the normal phones I've used, it still could be better.  I found it be a tad less receptive than my older Nokia 6101.  This has caused problems as I only get one to two bars in my home.  Most of the time it's OK, other times I get poor reception.  That never happened with the Nokia.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that there's no Wi-Fi.  If you live in an area with complete cell coverage then perhaps this won't matter to you.  I live in a semi-rural area where some locations have zero cell coverage.  However, within those areas are countless Wi-Fi hotspots where I could access the Internet.  This is absolutely necessary for my work.  To address this problem I picked up a Palm PDA.  To be blunt, however, I just wish Blackberry would offer this function.  It's something that professional reviewers on sites such as cnet note as a problem in all their reviews.\n\nOn a far lesser note, I wish the interface was more clean or, at the very least, allowed the user to change it more.  For example, on other phones things like alarm clock, calculator, etc. will get group together within a single folder.  Here they all get their own menu choice.  This creates unneeded clutter.  I'd like to be able to group them together.  And speaking of alarm clock - for a business oriented phone, this function is poor at best.  It completely lacks a timer function.  For example, if you want to take a quick 15 minute cat nap you have to go in and program the alarm clock to go off at a specific time instead of just setting it for 15 minutes.\n\nThe other interface problem is that the scroll wheel button does not have a consistent pattern.  In some programs clicking it is the same as hitting the return key.  In other programs it brings up a menu.  After awhile you get the hang of which programs do what.  Nonetheless, this creates an unneeded learning curve to a basic function.  They really need to have a return key function button right next to the scroll wheel.  This would allow for consistency and make it easier to hit return without having to first scroll on the right and then switch to a key on the front.\n\nLastly, on the plus side, the 8700g, despite what some claim, does allow for other bluetooth devices besides an earpiece.  I have a Shasta keyboard that works great.  According to some manufacturer sites, it's also possible to use a bluetooth scanner, although I've yet to try it.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with the 8700g.  (Can't say that about either of my last two new phones - a Samsung and a Nokia.)  I also look forward to buying a Blackberry in the future when perhaps they've added Wi-Fi and improved the interface a bit.\n\nEdit: As of around mid-October, T-mobile will finally release a smartphone with (stereo!) bluetooth and Wi-Fi.  It's called Dash and it looks a lot like a Blackberry, but runs Windows Mobile.  Besides the badly needed Wi-Fi, the phone also has a 1.3 camera and video, takes a memory card, is MyFaves capable, and allows for short voice recordings.  And here's a clincher - it also shares the Blackberry push email capability.  Drawbacks - fickle keys that sometimes don't work (especially the volume controls).\n\nWould I buy the Dash instead of the 8700g if I was buying now?  Probably.  Such is life when it comes to technology.

This review will be easy. I'm a crackberry enthusiast. I owned the previous 7105t and loved it the minute I started using it. What I love the most about these phones is the user interface (UI). Most other models use menus that are tedious and downright annoying. Blackberry software gets it right 100% of the time. With the use of a scroll wheel, menu selection and choice is fast. Couple this with the full sized keypad of the 8700g and you've got one powerful, portable device.\n\nSo when I stepped up to this new 8700g, I was simply amazed on many facets:\n\n1) The screen is large, bright and very colorful.\n\n2) The full qwerty keyboard is somewhat difficult in size, but you do adapt quickly and typing speed will increase. I can type almost as fast as a laptop now. Thats a significant improvement over the traditional multi-tap process.\n\n3) The fit and finish is top notch. Really. This phone is *very* pleasing to the touch. I was intimidated by the width at first. It's pretty wide, but again, you adapt and move on. The chrome mixed with the bluish-black exterior is very elegant yet informal. The device lures you in!\n\n4) Have I said it enough? The UI is very intelligent. Searching the address book uses multi-tap search. Enter the first three letters and it narrows down the choices in real-time. From the holster, I can initiate a call in about four seconds. I have yet to fumble through the address book and make a bad call...\n\n5) The technology! Paired with T-Mobile, this phone is part of the EDGE network. Basically, it's an enhanced GPRS network providing 4x the speed over a traditional GPRS. It is definitely noticable too. When browsing the web on this blackberry, it's quick and responsive to my queries. It's not as fast as DSL or Broadband, but it is much improved over the traditional network.\n\n6) Enhanced Audio. Finally! MP3 ringtones and custom methods to import your own ringtones. I've been watching my friends for TWO years now, enjoying such features. Now I can sneer back with joy, listening to Chewbacca roar when I get a call...\n\nThere are a few drawbacks, such as a screen that absorbs your face-juice. I'll be honest here: It's summer and when it's hot outside, you perspire. That gets on the screen and doesn't look so nice. I learned to keep an LCD wipe handy to keep it clean.\n\nAnother downer for some is the lack of a camera. Personally, I don't look at that as a \"feature\"...I probably sound old fashioned here, but I'm a little annoyed and disturbed that hundreds of thousands of people have portable recording devices in their pockets. Sure, they're really handy when your local town-tweaker decides to wig out on the sidewalk. Those make great shots, but it's just so unnatural. I'm happy to see that there is no camera. If it came with one, I'd probably cover it with black tape.\n\nOverall, this device scores a 5.

I've just switched to the Treo 700xw and now I couldn't be happier.\n\nHere is what I experienced in the last year:\n\nPositives (Yes, there are many):\n\n1)  Large Keypad.  This is the biggest thing I miss about switching over was the huge keypad that could be used.  And if you didn't want to open up that feature you could easily bring up a \"keyboard\" on the screen and use your stylus to do your typing.  I'd say I used both typing methods about 50-50.\n\n2)  Large Screen.  The real-estate is fantastic.  Looking at the screen I could see the time, owner information, how much mail I have in the four Email addresses I have, Active Tasks, Calendar information, and MSN information with room to spare!  No other phone had this much space on it.\n\n3)  Windows Mobile.  I've been keeping an eye on the mobile windows since Windows CE v2.0 but have been primarily a Palm OS user.  But this version of Windows Mobile is wonderful and has finally convinced me to switch over to Microsoft's OS!!  It is featured on both of these phones so I lost nothing switching over.  But having mobile office and the familiar feel of Windows at your fingertips is great, not to mention how easy it is to synchronize with Outlook.\n\n4)  Networking.  You have many options.  The phone can use the cell service to get around the Internet.  If that is too slow, you have the Wi-Fi feature to boot.  You can even use Skype over Wi-Fi, but I found this to not be fantastic.  And then you've got Bluetooth on top of that, which I loved to death.\n\nNegatives:\n\n1)  Battery life!!!  I've got a spare battery and with moderate use (not even heavy) I can go through both in 24 hours easily.  I usually have the Wi-Fi off and will often times even cut the bluetooth to conserve but this just runs out of batteries to fast for my likings.\n\n2)  Can't Turn Off.  This might be one reason that I cannot conserve battery life.  But the screen remains on for a very long time.  I can turn off the backlight but there is not way to kill the screen itself except to wait a while.  And because the screen is so large and covers the entire front side of the phone it is too easy while carrying the phone to accidentally touch something that opens a program.\n\n3)  Button Placement.  While avoiding touching the front screen it is real easy to hit the buttons to open a note, surf the net, and operate the camera.  These programs were ran the most but 80% of the time it was by accident because of where the buttons are placed.\n\n4)  Bad sound options.  There was very little flexibility in sounds.  You could have a certain ring and options for receiving phone calls but a much smaller subset for receiving text messages (which I received a lot).  But most phones allow a certain flexibility that this lacked when it came to sound options.\n\n5)  Freezes.  I am not the only one who had this problem, but this phone seems to freeze quite a lot.  I've known some people who are on their third and even fourth reformatting of the phone to get a fresh start and make it freeze less.  I guess that is just typical Microsoft Windows but I'm not having this problem on the 700wx.  A few times I would not have anything at all running but the system just got stuck and I couldn't answer phone calls until I reboot the device.\n\nSo far, I've enjoyed my new phone and am glad to be rid of the 6700.  The shortcomings outlined above have ALL been overcome by this new phone.  I would love them to upgrade this phone with something that resolves these issues because the keyboard and screen are a real piece of art.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, the problems outlined above have all been complaints by fellow users of this phone.  In fact, when I went in to buy my cell phone the person I bought it from had one and hated it with a passion and highly recommended the 700 despite the lower profit margin.", "summary": "Glad to be Rid of This Phone", "unixReviewTime": 1167177600}, {"overall": 3.0, "vote": "3", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2006", "reviewerID": "A2QRXQPHDMFCQV", "asin": "B000FOFRSG", "reviewerName": "SanjeevP", "reviewText": "I have owned this phone for 2 years.

I have also owned and used Blackberries, Treo's, LG Phones including the LG VX9800 and the Motorola Razor. I picked one up this week and here are my initial impressions.\n\nThe phone layout and design are excellent. Compared to other devices like the Blackberry and Treo, the keys are in a much better location (about  up from the bottom end of the phone) making it much less stressful on the thumbs to type. The keys functions are very similar to a Blackberry. Takes a little bit of getting use to but learn very quickly.\n\nActive Sync, which it comes with, is a breeze to set-up and start syncing. Works great with Outlook. I also have set-up my device to pull down emails from my gmail account. I read one review that said everything was being doubled when transferring. No so here. Works like a charm and very fast. Internet connections are much faster that on my Blackberry, which my work has supplied me.\n\nThe battery is another item that people tend to give bad reviews on. That may be why Verizon is currently offering a 60 dollar battery for 19 dollars. Supposedly the extended battery will give double the time which as I understand it from other users is about 2 days.\n\nOne of the big issues that people are focusing on in these reviews is the processing speed and how it is affected by having multiple applications open and the hassle of closing them once you are done with them. First, the Motorola is like any computer....having multiple applications open and running all at once will kill the processing speed of computer. Second, to close the programs is much easier than represented in these reviews. Just go to your home page and click on the top smart icons Task Manager and \"Kill All\" tasks running.\n\nSo far very happy with my decision.\n\nUpdate: 6/12/06\n\nAfter a week of using my Q, I am still pleased with my decision.  I continue to monitor the other reviews and what I find interesting is the fact that many people focus on items that are very nit picky, i.e. the screen is slightly off center.  Interesting...I didn't even notice until that person pointed it out.  What is also interesting is that people tend to want a device that does everything exceptionally well (pda, phone, etc).  I would agree that that would be the ideal but I am happy with a device that does everything good.  Each person has their own preferences and what you really need to keep in mind is what you need the device to do.  I just need a device that syncs with my home computer (outlook), can send text and picture messages, syncs with my email via the web and provides me occasional access to the internet.  The Q does all that and more.\n\nUpdate 6/16/06\nOk.  I have returned my phone(s) yes, plural!!  Let me explain why.\n\nThe first phone had an issue with it's bluetooth functionality/transmitter.  I returned it and exchanged for another Motorola Q.\n\nMy second phone I had for one day before it completely died and nothing I or tech support could do would allow it to be restarted.\n\nMotorola has some serious issues to overcome with their Quality Assurance program.\n\nWhen I was on the phone with Verizon Tech Support I asked them which device/Smartphone they recieved the least number of calls on...they said the Treo 700w.  As such, I return my Motorola Q and purchased the 700w.  Wow, what a difference!  The Treo is much faster and much easier to use.  I would downgrade my rating but unfortunately once the stars are choosen in Amazon's rating system they cannot be changed.", "summary": "Excellent Smartphone - Scratch that....bad  Smartphone", "unixReviewTime": 1149811200}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "12", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2006", "reviewerID": "AQZGG5F4JIRXO", "asin": "B000FYU4SO", "reviewerName": "flyingaho", "reviewText": "Or maybe not.  The good news is that for less than $200 ($100 if signing new agreement) this phone offers one of the best values in the current batch of \"smart\" phones.  The bad news is that you will be paying alot more for VerizonWireless services.\n\nThe phone offers most standard features which you would expect such as Web Browser, Outlook, MS Office, Multimedia, etc.  It has a nice design with big screen.  The phone's talk quality is very good.  I use Goodlink to synchronize the phone with my company's mail server, which works nicely.\n\nWhen comparing to the Treo, Q's biggest weaknesses are the lack of touch screen and the inability to edit word docs and spreadsheets (the Q can read them but not edit).  These features are not that important to me, but some of my coworkers find the touchscreen feature to be very useful.  The standard battery lasts only about a day, but the extended battery lasts at least a day and half with moderate/heavy usage.\n\nMy biggest issue with the phone is the keys.  My thumbs are too big to type accurately, so typing a 100 word email sometimes takes much longer than it should.  I have been using Tmobile's SideKick for a while and it's ALOT easier to type on the SideKick.\n\nVerizonWireless pricing is another concern, since this phone is a VerizonWirless exclusive I believe.  The standard 900 minute plan plus unlimited data totals about $110 before taxes.  After adding on $15 for a feature which allows the Q to be used as a broadband modem (Older Q models will need to download the latest patch first), $10 for 500 text messages, and $6 for insurance, my total monthly bill comes out to be somewhere north of $150.  If you are concerned with the cost and your company is not reimbursing your wireless bills, I suggest giving up this phone and use another carrier as similar level of services could cost $40+ less.\n\nCompared to the Sidekick, the Q lack a free, basic sticky notes utility, which I use all the time when I need to lookup airline and hotel reward numbers.  Goodlink does provide such utility but it's not free.\n\nOverall, I have been pleased with the phone so far.  I tested the download speed when the phone is used as a modem and I got about 385kbps download speed and 56kbps upload speed.

The Motorola Q is a must-have for anyone who needs both Internet access and PDA productivity features wherever they go.  Most PDA phones are bulky and quite clumsy for the task of conversing without the aid of a headset.  This phone, however, is short and slim enough to make that problem negligible.  It fits in an ordinary shirt or pants pocket with plenty of room to spare.  The speakerphone is of good quality, so if you don't have a headset and don't like pressing a PDA to your face, phone conversations still come through very clear.  Windows Mobile 5.0 has many useful features, but accessing them can be somewhat tedious work at times.  The keys are very tiny and I was disappointed that the Q doesn't have dedicated number keys, unlike the VX9800.  Also, the plastic cover on the mini-SD slot is hard to remove and practically requires a pair of small tweezers just to open.  Those are my main gripes about the phone, but overall the positives outnumber the negatives.  The camera takes decent pictures and the side scroll wheel comes in very handy for navigating around the screen.  Speaking of the screen, its very bright and crisp...though using it in direct sunlight may prove a little challenging.  As I stated at the beginning, the Internet features are oustanding.  I have Verizon's unlimited data plan and despite the fact EVDO is not yet available where I live, I can still stream radio stations flawlessly over the built-in Windows Media Player.  In fact, the Q multi-tasks like a champion: One time I was listening to a streaming audio feed, surfing the Internet, and sending a text message all at the same time without a trace of hesitation from the CPU.  Non-Internet applications like Pocket Streets and Trips also run smoothly.

I was very excited about the launch of the Motorola Q, since I was completely over my clunky, boring Blackberry for some time.  I thought that the Q would solve my \"Blackberry problem\" of being able to read attachments (in plain text format), but not being able to edit attached documents or compose and email documents from scratch.  How wrong I was!  Don't get me wrong - the Q does have a lot going for it: (1) a more attractive form factor than ANY Blackberry or PDA-phone I've ever seen, it's slim, light, and looks as much like a phone as a smartphone can; (2) it runs Windows Mobile, which is infinitely more attractive and familiar to me than the Palm OS or Blackberry platform.  It's also pretty strong on the \"fun\" factors, since it has a cool internet browser, Windows Media player for your music files, and a built-in digital camera.\n\nHowever, the Q's main shortfall--the inability to compose/edit documents--was a deal-breaker for me.  If, like me, you plan on using your smartphone as part of a mini-mobile-office, and your job involves heavy review and editing of documents received via email, then you might want to look for alternatives to the Q.  If you're a Windows-over-Palm person, the Palm Treo 700w may be a good alternative that has document composing and editing capabilities.  (I'm opting to get a laptop instead of a Palm 700w, given its memory limitations).  Or, if you are wedded to the Palm OS, there's always the Palm 700p.

This is creating problems with our anti-spam filters and I also believe this is unethical and should be illegal. We recommend against buying phones with this data/email service in our organization.\n\nWhen we configure our IMAP server option for the Motorola Q phone owned by one of our executives, the Verizon system is \"spoofing\" the email address as if the messages are being sent from our email server.

I'm sure they will agree with me that the problem should be instead resolved within Verizon's system software solution.\n\nInstead of spoofing a desired email address, messages coming from Verizon phones should have a distinct \"From\" and \"Reply-to\" addresses, with the first being any external Verizon wireless address, and the latter being the customer's desired and commonly used email address. The two must differ and only then the messages will not end up as spam because the sender won't be spoofed.\n\nAlthough Q seems like a good device, we advise against purchase and don't support their email integration in our organization until Verizon Wireless makes both \"From\" and \"Reply-to\" fields configurable.

Did they take the time to at least put it in their ear?  I'm writing this because they are making newer models, but with zero design improvements.\n\nProblem here is not the function or technical aspect, it's the design.  I have no idea who's ear this is designed for, but it's not for humans.  You would think that with the mention of three ear bud attachments and an ear ring, that some type of combination would be a perfect match for anyone.  Not even close.\n\nThe size is appealing, and the storage case charger is great.  It does work well, low noise, and good range.  However, it only has about four hours of use before you need to recharge.  But, if you have to balance it in your ear, and keep still, or hold it, it kinda defeats the purpose.  It being so small and falling out ALL the time also leaves you wondering where it went, and who is either sitting or stepping on it.\n\nSo, the cheap, flimsy useless piece of plastic thing that attaches to the headset has less value than the strip of plastic that you peel off the top of a milk jug cap.  Plus, there is no place to put it.  The headset goes in it's case, but you are supposed to put this plastic strip thing where, exactly?  Certainly not in your pocket as you will mistake it for garbage and throw it out.  That must be where mine is, because I have yet to see it in the past few weeks.\n\nThere are three rubbery ear bud cover things in different sizes.  They have an appending ring that may be there for fitting in your ear, or maybe to floss your teeth.  Who knows.  They do nothing, and the sad part about all of this is that the best fit is when you don't use any of the included attachments... but it hurts either way.  I had to spend additional money on two different sets of of ear bud covers.  One set were foam-like wraps... useless.

Perhaps that would not be true if my phone did not have voice recognition as well. I am thrilled with this little gem of a gadget. One last thing.

The tiny loop on the WEP200 earpiece is flexible and does a good job of hooking or bracing the unit in your ear.  You can also rotate it to fit it in your left or right ear.  I've been able to freely talk and move my head around without feeling like the headset would fall out.\n\nBattery life:\nThe battery life seems to be shorter than my Plantronics Voyager 510, but it's understandable with the much smaller size of the WEP200.  I really haven't had an issue with the battery, as long as I remember to take it out of the car with me to charge overnight or during the day.

People on the other end don't seem to have problems understanding me and I can hear them well enough.\n\nEase of use:\nThe buttons are big and easy to reach, but take a little bit of force.  Since the headset is so small though, it's easy enough to hold it in place while you press buttons.\n\nI also had no trouble connecting this headset to my Nokia 6300 phone.  In fact, I can switch between this in my car and my Plantronics at home without any issues.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent, inexpensive headset, especially for people who wear glasses.

Yes, its prone to interference, but I've yet to see a unit that doesn't occasionally give you a bit of static (JX10 - I'm looking at you!). Callers were impressed to hear that I was using a headset.\n\n2) Pairing - I've always thought this process to be a bit obtuse, but I guess it drives down costs to have the much-vaunted \"multi-funtion\" button. I find it annoying. That said, pairing was quick and easy with this unit and it **stays** paired for hours at a time.\n\n3) Fit - Stays paired and stays in my ear for hours at a time. Does it hurt? Heck, even my ears can't stand canalphones. I stand at 6 feet and yet I have the earcanals of a 5 year old, I guess. I don't have a problem using this set all day, but my ears are still a bit sore. Still, this is much better than other models I've used (JX10 - I'm still looking at you!). For the record, I'm using the smallest gel. The WEP200 gives you three different sizes.\n\n4) Price - one of the cheapest BT headsets around. I've tried expensive, I've tried cheap, I've tried middle of the road. So far, the WEP200 beats em all, even when not factoring in the cost.\n\n5) Range - doesn't matter what side of my body this unit is on, it almost always makes a clear connection to the BB 8800. I also use this unit to take VOIP calls via Cisco IP Communicator on my Dell D620 laptop and iChat audio on my Macbook Pro. It gives you just enough freedom to roam. You start loosing your signal at about twenty feet in clear line of sight.\n\nCons -\n\n1) Size - Unit is super tiny! It gets lost in my shirt pocket, my jacket pocket, left on the counter. Annoying when you are getting a call and your headset is still paired to your mobile. Its never a fun scramble, especially when someone important is at the other end. \"Hang on a second! I need to find the headset!!!\"\n\n2) Charger - Not thrilled about the charger/carrying case, but if it helps keep the size of the headset down, I can't complain too much. I feel compelled to get my wife to buy one, just so we'd have two chargers around the house - one for upstairs and another downstairs.

People say I sound great on it and didn't realize I was wearing one and I have a car with a lot of wind-noise. Fit better once I cut off the loop. And I can see why people say it hurts after a long time or it may fall off. I don't intend to use it for hours or use it out of the car. So if it falls off, it will fall under the seats where I can retrieve it. The only reason to use it is in the car due to the state law.

Feel free to patent it. I went to Verizon Wireless in Circuit City and bought their Verizon black \"replacement ear cushions\". My ears like felt material better than rubber for some reason. My WEP200 now fits in my ear very tightly (won't fall out) and it feels very comfortable. The rubber covers that come from Samsung are what hurt my ears. I will never wear them again. It still sounds great and since the cushions are black they look great too. My WEP200 now fits as snug as a bug in a rug. And the pain is gone. I can wear these for hours with no ear aches. So this is the solution for me. Glad I thought of it. For those of you have bought the WEP200 or are thinking of it, spend an extra $3 for some ear cushions. Your ears will appreciate it.

Tell your phone to search for headsets, then hold down the H350 main button for about 10 seconds. Your phone finds the H350 and you hit \"ok.\" This works as expected and is no different from any other bluetooth headset. I've used this headset with my Motorola RAZR and Uniden landline bluetooth-capable phone.\n\nCOMFORT/DESIGN\nThe H350 has an earclip that easily pops off so that you can fit the headset onto either ear. The clip itself is flexible rubber and while it seems moderately comfortable at first, I find my ear starts to hurt after about 30 minutes. Ideally, I do not want to notice or feel that I'm wearing a headset. I definitely cannot say that about the H350. The speaker lightly rests over your ear canal. There are two volume buttons on the top and bottom of the headset to increase, decrease, or mute the speaker.\n\nSOUND QUALITY\nI've tried quite a few headsets out there from Plantronics, Motorola and Jabra to compare. Most of them have some deficiencies, and the H350 is no different. People on the other end of my conversations state that while my voice is clear, it sounds a little \"far-away.\" I also think that the highest volume ability of the H350 speaker on my end is still too weak (yes, I have perfectly normal hearing). When you max out the speaker volume the sound becomes a bit distorted and it's still not loud enough to clearly hear the other caller while driving in a car, even with the windows all the way up. This is in stark contrast to the Plantronics 640-665 series which have jelly earpieces that comfortably squish into your ear canal for optimal volume and clarity. As a result, I can only recommend the H350 for home use where there isn't alot of background noise present.\n\nOVERALL\nAt it's basic level, the Motorola H350 bluetooth headset works. You maintain a good connection between it and your phone within 10-12 feet (like any other functional headset). However, it's shortcomings in volume and mic quality cannot be overlooked. I only recommend this headset if you plan on using it at home or in the office, and only if you got it for a great price.

Also, in term of call features, you can recieve, reject, even put a call on hold while you're getting another call with just one button.\n\nHowever, I think the way manufacturers design bluetooth headsets, where it's so high above the mouth, reduced the sound quality significantly. People keep on telling me to repeat what I'm saying because they can't hear me clearly. Don't get me wrong. People on the other end CAN hear you if you speak loud enough. But if you compare speaking on bluetooth headset (on a normal position) with speaking on the phone microphone or a cable headset, bluetooth headset still have inferior sound quality.\n\nAnother issue is the weight.

Gehrke", "reviewText": "Item was purchased to replace a Motorola 300 headset. Worked ok but, paired fast. Volume was ok but could have been louder. Biggest drawbacks were callers could barely hear me if I was not using my 'outside' voice which is annoying to others around you. The other complaint is the fit. I still do not understand how Motorola engineers enjoy this design. It feels like it is going to fall off and on occasion does. Item was returned within 30 day policy of where it was purchased. Here is where I am at currently with headsets....this is my review for the cardo scala 700lx that I currently own and am very happy with so far. I feel the cardo is a better unit for comperable price.\n\nMy first bluetooth was a Motorola. I have not been happy with the Motorola fit as it feels like it is going to fall off...and on occasions it has. I am also replacing the motorola because I now have 2 cell phones I need to carry and want to use both simaltaneously. To replace it, I found a great deal on a Jabra BT5010. Great headset, so good, my wife stole it. Went to buy another and the price had gone back up. I tend to lose or damage things, so I have set a budget of no more than $30-$40. I then found a deal on a Jabra BT5020. I had received a bad unit and the exchange from another buy.ing website went bad and finally received my money back. Again, went to buy another and the price had gone up. This led me to the Cardo 700lx.\n\nFirst off, the fit is by far the best of the 3 I have had. I can honestly say, I have forgotten it was on and it can startle you when a call comes in. After 5-10 minutes, you don't even notice it on at all. Extremely light weight. A 5 star in my book. Where as, the motorola is a 1 star, the BT5010 is a 3 star, and the BT5020 is a 3.5 star.\n\nNext is ease of use. I like the placement of buttons. The main button on front has a definate click to it so you know you have pressed it and doesn't leave you guessing. The rocker volume dial on back is great for adjusting volume and can be reversed if placing on your left ear so rocking up is always louder and rocking down is quieter. Pressing the dial in also has function as well. Neat, simple design and easy to access with larger fingers. Again, 5 star.\n\nFinally is funtionality. This is where I have to question my rating. I know this is not a $50 headset, $75 headset, or even a $100+ headset and won't rate it/compare it to such. I understand you get what you pay for. With that said, here is my humble opinion. The headset has great volume and sounds as good as using the phone itself. However, the range is not as good at the others I have used. The Headset operates best with the phone in sight. Static is noticed by the caller (not me) if the phone is on my body the opposite of each other. In the car, it is best to place in the right ear and the phone in the center console or passenger seat. If you want to use it in the left ear, the phone should be on that side. Same side line of sight distance is approximately 10-12 feet before static comes in for the caller. Call quality is always good on my end, however again, the caller definately knows you are on a headset as it does have a slight echo. Again, I know this is not an expensive headset and is not perfect. But, no caller has complained when asked. Some didn't even know I was on a headset. Background noise is an issue for the caller though. One does need to close the windows, turn down/off the radio, lower the HVAC fan for a quality business conversation.\n\nFinal note comes to the multiple bluetooth pairing function. The main feature I was looing for was having a headset that would work with 2 phones. Since I carry a personal phone and a work phone, I want to answer and use both without changing phones or settings. The Jabra's were good, but voice recognition, redialing, and funcions only worked with the last phone paired up. That means, if you wanted to use the 1st phone you connected, you had to find the phone and manually use it. Not bad if it is seldom used. As for me, I use each phone equally. This headset allows you to double tap the volume rocker to switch between each phone. Great feature that allows full function use of each phone. The only drawback is that only one phone is 'active' at a time on the headset. Meaning, if you are talking on phone 'A' and then hang up...minutes later phone 'B' rings, you do not hear it in your headset and must listen for the phones ringer/vibrate. Then, once you hear the other phone ring, you double tap the volume rocker to switch over to the phone 'B'. A drawback to be able to use full function of 2 phones. In the Jabra's, the headset would ring for each phone without doing anything (great), but voice dialing was only for the last phone paired.\n\nAdded benefits include not having to by accessories. It come in the box with a wall charger, car charger, usb charger, and a belt/carry pouch.\n\nIn conclusion, great headset for $30. In that price range (under $50??) it is a 5 star. Is there better out there. Certainly. But you have to double, if not, triple the price. For $30.00, I am extremely happy and would recommend it to others.", "summary": "Poor fit, average function", "unixReviewTime": 1215907200}, {"overall": 2.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2008", "reviewerID": "AWL6CEI0EPOQA", "asin": "B000GX9D9K", "reviewerName": "Joeseph", "reviewText": "This bluetooth was my first and worst.

So after a few hours of reading reviews on a dozen or so different headsets, I finally decided just to settle for the H500, I was really interested in some of the Plantronics sets, but she didn't care for the design.. I was a little worried about the H500 because the reviews are kinda so-so.. They're either good reviews or bad reviews.  I got it for her so she wouldn't have to fumble around in the car with a phone so how it performs in a vehicle was going to be the make or break point with it.  I'm pleased to say that the headset performs way better than I expected it to.\n\nGetting started is a breeze.  All you have to do is charge the headset for about 2 hours (the LED light will go off once the battery is charged) once it's done charging you have to pair it up with your phone.  All you do is press and hold the call button until the LED light stops blinking and stays lit, then you have your phone set to hands free mode and follow the simple steps on the phone (For us it was as simple as the phone finding the H500 and entering the 4-digit pin of 0000)  The phone saved the settings and we were all set.\n\nUsing the headset is no brainer basically.  There 3 buttons; Main call/multi button & Volume up & down buttons.  Pressing these buttons in various combos will yield different results like mute, hold, transfer, 3-way, etc. The retail package comes with a handy fold out that has all the functions and how to access them.\n\nThe build quality of the headset is great as well.. The headset is about 2 inches from earclip to mic.  Its very small and very comfortable to wear.  The ear clip is removable to you can use it on either ear as well.  The buttons feel solid as well.\n\nNow to the actual sound quality.  The headset has performed great in all the scenarios we've tried so far.. Which has been in the house while watching TV, In the car with the stereo & windows up & down & in an office environment.  I was most impressed with how it performed while driving, There is no static or any background noise at all and even with the radio and window down, the user can clearly be heard both ways.  Again very impressive.  The only environment we haven't really tried yet was at the store.  I will update once I've tested that as well.\n\nI can't really comment on the battery life yet, because we've only had the unit for a day or so, but so far the unit has yet needed to be charged.\n\nSo to summarize, great headset overall, feels & looks great, sound quality is super, voices are loud and clear.  Performance in the car, home & office was excellent and the price Amazon offers is great compared to retail.

About the size of a deck of cards but around twice as thick.\n Has a single 2 Amp USB charging port for charging phones or tablets.\n Large capacity that has plenty of power to charge a phone several times and an iPad just about once.\n Excellent charging speeds as compared to competing power banks. Added 20% in 20 minutes to an iPhone 6.\n Has four battery gauge LEDs to show you charging status and remaining capacity.\n Includes a Micro USB charging cable for charging the power bank or a Micro USB device.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, the Eachine X7 10000mAh Power Bank worked really well. It is small for its capacity and has a single USB port for charging phones or tablets.  The overall look is nice with its aluminum casing. I tested it with my iPhone 6 and iPad Mini and both charged just fine. It added 10% charge in the first 10 minutes of charging and another 10% in the second 10 minutes to my iPhone 6, which is a really good result for iPhone 6 charging speeds.

While this phone has some plusses -- great looks, excellent sound for both voice and music -- it has far too many negatives for my liking.\n\nThe keypad is so small that it is better suited to the hands of a toddler than an adult. Dialing a number is often an exercise in frustration, as you'll invariably hit keys you didn't intend to hit. The trick here is to be slow and deliberate in entering the numbers. Texting is also nearly impossible, even at slow speed. You'll have to shift to ulta-slow speed to have any chance of texting for any length of time. Eventually you'll abandon texting altogether as a few of my Chocolate-owing friends have. It's just not worth the nonstop hassles.\n\nMany users have complained about the END key being located on the side of the phone. It's a valid complaint, because if you hold the phone normally during a call, you'll often accidentally hit the END key while in the middle of a conversation and terminate the call. To avoid this, you have to hold the phone just so, and there is little room for error.\n\nThe touch-sensitive wheel on the front is also a catastrophe of design. It looks cool, but is horrible to use. And because you'll often activate it while in the middle of a call, simply by raising or lowering the earpiece volume, you'll inadvertently invoke functions and applications you didn't mean to. This is because your face will brush against the phone as you are speaking, and if the wheel is activated, you'll do all kinds of weird things you didn't intend to -- launch the web browser, bring up an appointment calendar that will beep constantly in your ear, dial random people, etc. These things happen often.\n\nFor women, it seems particularly troublesome, because they often carry their phones in their purses. Remember, if any of the buttons on the side of the phone are pressed, it activates the wheel. In a small purse, buttons get pressed all the time. My wife went to retrieve her phone from her purse recently, and discovered it had been connected to the Web for about an hour. Other times, she found that it had called random people.\n\nThe Chocolate is just flat-out awkward to use, no matter how familiar you become with it.

I can now be at the gym, working out to music and if a phone call comes in, it automatically switches over to the phone function.  When the call is done, the music comes right back on.  MAGIC!!  :-)\n\nBattery - I purchased the extended battery with the phone.  Even with the MP3 player useage I get about 2 days of use before having to charge.  That is excellent compared to what my Treo used to get.\n\nPutting on personal ringtones - Here is where Verizon tries to lock things down.  Interest enough though, I figured out a work around.\n\nHere it is:  First create your music clip from a song you like.  To do this you will need software (ie. Roxio) that allows you to edit sounds.  There is a limit on the size of the file you can use.  From what I have figured out it is about 10 seconds at low MP3 quality.  Once you are done, save the clip to your Mini SD card.  Put the card in the phone, open your sounds and send the file to your cell phone.  Once you receive the file, you will have the ability to save it as a ringtone.  Someone may have an easier what to do this but this is the only way I have found that actually works.\n\nBluetooth - Tried a number of headsets but the best so far is Plantronics 320.  Headsets tried included the Jabra JX10, Motorola H700 and H850.\n\nOverall very happy with this phone and will probably keep for a while (which is saying something for me)", "summary": "Like it - Like it ALOT", "unixReviewTime": 1156377600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "12", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "08 18, 2006", "reviewerID": "A91LOU9XGER2N", "asin": "B000H7GVA4", "reviewerName": "Harold Corbin", "reviewText": "PROS:\n\n- Small body\n\n- No protruding antenna\n\n- Nice big screen\n\n- Plays MP3's and allows you to make playlists\n\n- Voice Commands\n\n- Looks cool\n\n- Good signal so far, drops fewer calls than my last phone\n\n- Memory card expansion slot\n\nCONS:\n\n- Of the 100 MP3's I tried to sync, only half got transferred... and the rest generated generic errors.

Cool, I thought.  Then I used it less and less, because the thing had to be recharged at home and would only last about an hour.  Soon I thought it was just too hard to use ... hard to put on, and totally weird in that to turn it on you had to take it OFF your ear, flip down the mouthpiece, then put it BACK on your ear.  Whoever designed the thing had no clue how people use headsets.  It also sounded like I was talking from the bottom of a water well.  Whenever I used it on conference calls people would yell for me to go on mute.  So I started asking people in the waiting rooms at airports what brand they had and what brand they liked.  I got so many people who hated Jabra that I didn't even consider it.  I already didn't really care for Motorola, so I started looking at Nokia, which seem to be nice but clumsy, and then I kept meeting more and more people who were in love with their Plantronics.  I have used Plantronics headsets for a long time in the office, after all, that's all they do and they seem to do it well.  I looked at a few Plantronics and didn't find one that jumped out at me, then one day I ran across the Explorer 350.  This was just too good to be true!  Are you kidding me, $49 bucks for a Bluetooth headset made by the top brand?  Then I looked closer and found that Plantronics did something very unique with this headset.  Instead of having to charge it at home, it comes with an extremely cool little clip that either mounts to your dash or hooks to your air vent in your car then plugs into your cigarette lighter.  Now that made sense!  A place to hold the headset where you use it most, always charging, then ready to use in a second or to walk around the rest of the day with it fully charged.  For us road warriors, Plantronics also thoughtfully included a USB charging cable so the trusty laptop will keep your headset charged while you sleep.  You can buy an optional AC adapter if that makes you feel more secure.  So how is it built and how does it perform?  Built like a Hummer!  The main piece is one solid chunk that looks like it is pretty immune to any normal damage while clunking around in your pocket with a lot of coins.  The piece that goes around your ear looks like it is solid as well, and effortlessly switches from ear to ear and slips on with one easy motion.  After the first time, this thing slips on with no thought on my part and instantly is in the perfect position for use.  Operation couldn't be simpler.  Unlike my Motorola with several switches that you had to remember how and what sequence to push them in, the Plantronics has one switch.  Push it in to turn it on, push it in to turn it off, push it in to talk, push it in to hang up, push it in to voice dial, etc.  All you have to do is push.  Want to make it louder or quieter?  Push up or push down.  No-brainer.  I saved performance for last because this is what convinced me to keep it.  After a quick charge I called a friend from my car with the window rolled down.  This is a friend I talk to all the time from my land line.  I said, hey, I just bought a new Bluetooth headset and want to see how it sounds to you.  He said, cool, put it on and I'll let you know.  I said ... I already have it on!  He said the sound was perfect, no background noise of any kind and it sounded at least as good as my landline.  One of the things several of my airport buddies told me they liked about Plantronics is how the durable rubber earpiece fits comfortably inside your ear and blocks out noise ... like annoying flight announcements.  I have to say that not only did I sound perfect to my friend but every call I have been on has been easier to hear than with any other headset I have ever tried.\n\nPROS:\n\nSound Quality\n\nSuperior construction\n\nEase of use\n\nPairing - instant and flawless\n\nPrice\n\nComfort\n\nCONS:\n\nNone I could see.

No contest. I have made the mistake of purchasing Jawbone, Sennheiser, BlueParrot, Motorolla, Blue Trek, and god only knows which others. Plantronics is the only brand I've purchased more than 1 of. While many of these brands cost well over 4 to 5 times what this one does, none of them can compare on battery life, consistency of connection, or all around value. This headset does take some getting used to as the rubber boot on it slightly penetrates your ear, but after a few days you will forget you are wearing it.

The mic is not as sensitive as those found in the Jawbone, so doing something productive like washing dishes won't blow out the eardrum of whoever you are speaking with, but they will hear some level of noise(the Jawbone is brutally painful for that!).

She found the 330 painfully uncomfortable and decided to sacrifice style for comfort (quite a departure from her typical choices, particularly regarding footwear); thus she is now enjoying my 510 and I'm getting by with the 330. I don't find the 330 uncomfortable for the first few hours, but I never forget it's in my ear like I did with the 510. If you have very small ears, it's probably a bad choice.\n\nHere's a brief comparison between the two with my 5 point ratings:\n\nSTYLE & DESIGN\nI greatly prefer the 330's single side button that makes it very easy adjust the volume. On the 510, I found the volume and power buttons behind the ear difficult to reach and easy to confuse - probably my biggest complaint with the 510.\n\nI prefer the look and size of the 330. It's more modern and discreet. However, it's not a fashion accessory and everyone looks like a dork with a flashing blue light next to their ear with any BT headset. I wish people would realize this and take these things off in public (especially in restaurants). I only use mine in the car or when at the computer so this is the least important criteria for me.\n\nCOMFORT\nThe 510 is the clear winner here for both me and my wife. Everyone's ear is different and I find the 330 less uncomfortable than my wife did. A few may find the 330 fits them better than the 510, but the 510 includes 3 ear pieces to provide a custom fit.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nThis is the best reason to get the 510. I've used worse headsets than the 330, but none better than the 510. With the 330, I get static if the phone is on the other side of body from the headset. The 330's claimed 30' range - maybe at high altitude with no obstructions, no other radio interference with no solar flares and a full moon - real world, more like 10' with no obstructions.\n\nNoise canceling is far superior on the 510. People would never guess I was using a headset - usually they couldn't even tell when I was in my car. The 330 is about useless in a windy environment and picks up a lot of background noise.\n\nBoth headsets seem to have very good battery life and audio quality for listening. The 510 also has the advantage of being able to pair with 2 devices simultaneously but I've never tried this feature.\n\nSTYLE & DESIGN\n330 - 4\n510 - 2\n\nCOMFORT\n330 - 3\n510 - 5\n\nPERFORMANCE\n330 - 3\n510 - 5\n\nFEATURES & PRICE\n330 - 4  (probably better than most headsets < $30)\n510 - 5  (more expensive but worth it for features and performance)\n\nOVERALL\n330 - 3\n510 - 5\n\nThe comfort and performance of the 510 justify the extra $16.", "summary": "Plantronics Explorer 330 vs. Plantronics Voyager 510", "unixReviewTime": 1204848000}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "12", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2008", "reviewerID": "A2SJYD2F9DTYU1", "asin": "B000HBMP82", "style": {"Color:": " Grey Silver"}, "reviewerName": "Kenny B", "reviewText": "This is a good inexpensive Bluetooth headset.

Christensen", "reviewText": "I purchased this unit primarily to use with my MacBook and Skype for conducting business calls.  Previously I was using the Logitech Clear Chat Pro wired USB headset with very good results, but after breaking a couple of them by accidentally yanking the cords from my Mac, I wanted to try a wireless solution.  So far, the results have been mixed.  Here are some highlights:\n\n1. Build Quality - 3 stars\n\nThe build quality seems pretty good, especially for something in this price range.  The construction is mostly all plastic, but the hinge mechanisms and stress points appear to be adequately constructed.  I would NOT expect these headsets to stand up to much abuse - e.g. extensive travel where they are jammed in and out of a bag, dropped on the ground, etc.  For daily office or home use where they are place into a drawer or on a desk when not in use, they should give a good service life.  People have complained that the foam earpieces fall off, but after a couple weeks of use, I have not seen any indications of this problem.  The switches all operate smoothly, and while the overall design is a bit clunky, that is more an aesthetic comment than a quality comment.\n\n2. Features - 4 stars\n\nThe headset has a good feature set, supporting both the stereo headphone profile (A2DP) and the \"headset\" profile.  I have used these with both my Mac and my iPhone and with the Mac both profiles work, with easy switching between the two using the \"Bluetooth Preferences\" drop down for on-the-fly changes.  With the iPhone, only the \"headset\" profile is supported (this is an iPhone limitation, NOT a limitation of this headset).  Buttons for volume, skip/fast forward, skip/fast rewind work well with iTunes on the laptop.  Only the volume controls and \"call answer/end\" buttons seem to work with the iPhone in the headset mode.\n\n3. Operation/usage  - 2 stars\n\nPairing with both the Mac and the iPhone was absolutely seamless, and switching between the two is fairly straightforward, though I have not tried to have the headset paired and connected to both devices - I'm not sure this works.  For now, I disable Bluetooth on my iPhone when it is nearby and I want to pair the PT590 to my Macbook, because otherwise the PT590 will connect to its last device, which is usually my iPhone when on the road.  The comfort of these headphones is so-so - the ear pads are relatively small, and the over-the-head band is quite tight (and I have a small head).  I can imagine that they would be quite uncomfortable for anyone with a large melon.  Stretching the band would be dangerous, since it is made of plastic and would probably break.  perhaps heating it with a blow dryer and gently stretching it out might work...  The foam ear pads are thin, and since the ear pieces press pretty firmly against the head, they do cause minor discomfort after some period of time.  They are no where near as comfortable as my Bose QCII headphones, but these are $60 and the Bose are $300, so I would expect that to be the case.  They are more comfortable than other headphones I have had in this <$100 price range, including both wired and wireless units.  I would not recommend them for all-day use sitting at a desk (get the Bose and live with the wires), but for short stints they are great.\n\nThe blue light is annoying, but it is also an important status indicator for things like call status and battery life.  It is one of the ways my wife knows when I am on a call in my office when she walks in to talk to me.\n\nOperating the unit is very easy - answering a call, you touch a button, the same button ends the call. For listening to music, the controls are a bit less intuitive - the top and bottom buttons skip forward or reverse, and the front and rear buttons increase or decrease the volume - this seems like it was not thought out very well, as the functions between the two pairs of buttons should be swapped to be more intuitive.\n\nThe pull-out boom for the mic is a nice feature, and there is a built-in wind screen.  I have not tried these units in windy conditions but would expect their performance to exceed many other \"mini\" headsets for mobile phone usage.\n\nOne \"nit\" I have is that in order to get the boom mic to point down towards one's mouth, the headband needs to sit pretty far forward on the head - it feels slightly unnatural.  So this leaves you with the choice of either tilting the whole setup forward to angle the mic towards the mouth, or put them on feeling more natural, but have the mic pointed up at one's nose/cheek.\n\nNote:  I use these headphones alongside a logitech bluetooth mouse and have been surprised at how little interference there is between the two.  Occasionally my mouse will freeze, but a click will usually quickly restore service to the mouse.  There is no static induced in the headphones by the mouse that I can discern.\n\n4. Performance - 4 stars for music,  2 stars for Skype\n\nOverall performance of these units is quite good, with the exception of VOIP or Skype calling.\n\n  4.1 Music - music sounds surprisingly full and rich, given that these units are small and rather flimsy feeling (e.g. lightweight).  The are \"on the ear\" style headphones, so they do not offer any passive noise reduction, and the sound leakage from the outside into the ears as well as from the 'phones to the outside is pretty significant (I can't watch a movie on my laptop in bed while my wife is trying to sleep - something I do routinely with my Bose QCII headphones).  But for average music listening, they are really surprisingly good.  By tweaking the EQ settings, you can get them to sound as good or better than many wired headphones in this price range, and the amount of stutter or static is surprisingly low.\n\n  4.2 Skype - 1 star - I cannot recommend these units for Skype - Out use.  This may be a limitation of Bluetooth for VOIP calling, as I have not tried other Bluetooth sets, the amount of lag introduced by these units is unacceptable for business-level conversation.  I know that this is not a limitation of Skype, as I previously used a wired Logitech headset with very good results with Skype.  The lag can vary in severity, but even at its best, it is noticeable - almost like talking to someone over a satellite connection where there is several hundred milliseconds of delay.  It can get annoying very quickly.  At its worst, it is totally unusable, as people I am talking to hear nothing but static and garbled speech.  I have reached the point where I really only use them when I am on long conference calls where I just have to listen for 95% of the time.  For real calls, I have had to go back to using my cell phone.\n\n  4.3 Phone - 5 stars - probably the best quality audio (both mic and speakers) that I have used with my iPhone or my Motorola Razr.  The headphones are big and dorky looking while walking through an airport, but boy, they sure stay on your head when you lean over to pick up your bag, and they seem to do a great job of filtering out background noise.\n\nOverall, the performance of these units is very good for the price.  If you are buying them for music and /or for use with a phone (especially one that supports the A2DP profile)  I highly recommend them - you cannot beat the performance at this price point.  For use with Skype at a desktop computer, I cannot recommend them, and suggest you use a wired USB or audio jack type headset.", "summary": "Great for music, not so great for Skype", "unixReviewTime": 1233273600}, {"overall": 3.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2008", "reviewerID": "A2QRXQPHDMFCQV", "asin": "B000HBPMVY", "reviewerName": "SanjeevP", "reviewText": "I have used these headsets for more than 2 years with my iPod classic and a variety of Bluetooth cell phones.

It's too bad that SE doesn't sell their 5MP and 6MP camera phones stateside.  But the K790a is very capable as a digital camera.  Sure, it's only 3MP, but like many professionals will tell you, pixel count is only one thing.  This 3MP camera-in-a-phone takes better-looking pictures than 5MP and 6MP cameras from Vivitar, Aptech (sp?), Samsung and other offbrand companies.  My main phone is a Sanyo M1 with 2MP and I thought it was pretty good for a camera phone, but when I got the K790a to use with my prepaid SIM card, I was simply blown away by the quality.  (Of course, I bought the phone exactly because I had heard of great things about its picture quality, but the results still far exceeded my high expectations.)  The camera is very easy to use.  I don't care for the MMS features because my prepaid service (Speak Out Wireless) doesn't support them.  I just download them to my PC using a USB card reader.  I wish there were optical zoom (more and more camera phones in Japan, including models from Casio, now have optical zoom) but the truth is of course that if you need serious picture-taking you still use a real digital camera.  But this comes real close to replacing your workhorse digicam.  I'll use this for a year and upgrade to SE's next gen next year, hopefully by then they'll have released optical zoom-equipped K phones.\n\nIn summary, this is a great camera.

Seems like the plastic used on the earloop isn't strong enough.\n\n3. The audio is reset back to default after turning off the headset, and the default volumne of the headset is pretty high.\n\n4. Once you put the headset to mute (by holding the dial during conversation), you can't adjust the volume. I found this one of the biggest cons and very annoying.\n\n5. Again, while on mute, the headset reminds you that you're on mute by beeping every 10 or 20 seconds. The beeps are just too long (2 beeps that lasts almost 2 seconds) that I miss the conversation from other parties. In case you wonder why it matters, I use the headset to join conference call.\n\n6. The end of USB cable that attaches to the headset is NOT standard mini-USB. It would be so much better to carry just 1 USB cable so that I can charge the RAZR and the headset\n\n7. Like all other BT headsets, static is still a problem. When no static is present, people can still tell I'm on cellphone or using BT headset, even I'm in a quiet room. And I must say the RAZR's audio and mic quality is pretty darn good.\n\n8. Not easy to adjust the earloop to a comfortable and snuggle position. At a reasonable snuggle and comfortable position, the mic points to my nose instead of my mouth.\n\n9. It fits ok with my glasses, although far from perfect. However I may have to try out others in order to see whether this one is better than the rest.\n\n10. The indicator light blinks even though I'm not on a call. Well, I can see why it's blinking, just to remind me that the headset is on... however I hope there's a better way to \"remind\" me that, or allow me to disable the blinking.\n\n11. Noise cancellation... is there any? The box says it does, but apparently not good enough.\n\nI will keep using it as I paid more than $30 bucks for it. It's acceptable, but again I have to work around some of the annoying stuff. But then I doubt there's anything that cost less than $50 and offers excellent voice quality and fit comfortably.", "summary": "Decent, but not good enough", "unixReviewTime": 1178236800}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "2", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2007", "reviewerID": "A37LB9I5B8J715", "asin": "B000HD79J0", "reviewerName": "pj", "reviewText": "I can't even begin to tell you the hell I've been through with other BT headsets and the Treo 650. They all had pairing issues - either they won't pair with the phone or they don't stay paired.  And the volume was not loud enough.  I returned at least 5 headsets until I came across this one.  The sound quality is maybe an 8 out of 10 but the volume is unbelievable, and this coming from a guy that doesn't have the best hearing.  I can actually hear the person on the line - all the time.  Even in noisy environments.  No complaints from people on the receiving end except when I'm in the home and the mircowave oven is running (this will scramble almost all BT frequencies).  Buttons are placed well and they are very responsive.\n\nInitial pairing was a breeze and the 700 connects to my phone flawlessly on virtually every call.  In the two weeks I've owned it, I think it failed to connect on two occasions and I make well over 50 calls/day.  This compares to the 75% connect rate I realized with other BT headsets.\n\nBattery life is a 10 out of 10.  I charge the headset every day but I often talk 5-6 hours in one day without recharging.  Just amazing!  They claim 10 hours (which it may actually achieve) but I'm amazed it can actually make it past 5 hours.\n\nThe range is not that great but I can't fault the headset as Treo is known to incorporate substandard BT electronics into their phones - which make the range very, very poor.  Once in a while, if the phone is in my right pocket and headset in my left ear, there is a slight crackling noise.  It's not bad though, but can be annoying.  Pulling it out of my pocket immediately relieves the problem.\n\nWhatever you do, don't attempt to test the buzzer feature when the headset is in your ear - the buzzing is LOUD when it's placed right in the ear.  But if you needed to find it if lost in the room, be prepared to make the room very quiet to locate it.  It relies on the internal speaker to create the buzzing sound.\n\nNice to have TWO chargers available in the retail packaging (one standard wall outlet adapter and one USB charger).  The carrying case was useless but a nice add nonetheless.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone with a Treo 650.  I'm not sure if this headset will rate as well with other phones but I can guarantee you won't find a better BT headset for the 650.", "summary": "Actually works with the Treo 650", "unixReviewTime": 1175558400}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 30, 2007", "reviewerID": "A3L2QLNVY7RSL9", "asin": "B000HD79J0", "reviewerName": "H.

Everything looked flimsy and designed with no regards to the Human ears, and the sound quality sounded like somebody was talking to me through a tin can. But I took a deep breath and decided to give it a chance. And here I am, got used to it.\n\nAt the beginning you might feel that it doesn't sit well on your ear and the speaker doesn't go fully inside your ear so you might think you are actually getting the outside noises into the mix. But after a while, you get the 'hang' of it and you learn how to wear it, bend the loop around your ear (which by the way can be easily exchanged from left to right), and sit comfortably on your ear. People say they hear me clear and very well. I hear them clear as well (although the tin can effect is still there, but that really isn't bothering me at all).\n\nI have used many kinds before, and let me tell you, there is no reason you should pay $40+ on such an ear piece, it is not worth it. Certainly not those ones that cost $90 or $100 or more!!. Stick with the Cardo and you will be OK with that. After all you just need something you can speak into and hear well. And this one does do the job.\n\nSome people praise or are hooked on the neat feature of swapping between two phones. I honestly don't see where this features becomes practical, unless you are one of those people who carry multiple phones for... who knows what for... But if this features speaks to you, then definitely, this  one is made for you.\n\nEnjoy!", "summary": "Somewhat awkward but does a good job", "unixReviewTime": 1175212800}, {"overall": 3.0, "vote": "3", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2007", "reviewerID": "A1L43DT6YTY635", "asin": "B000HD79J0", "reviewerName": "JT Kirk", "reviewText": "I got this for my Samsung M500, it was the second BT headset I tried. Out of the packaging and all charged up, it took a lot of talking over 2 days to put a proverbial dent in the rechargeable battery - the simple battery strength reading is a great feature. Another fine feature is the ability to easily turn off the standby light. It plays a brief midi melody from \"Flight of the Valkyries\" when a call is received, but also when a text message is received - I'd prefer it didn't tell me I just got a call when I didn't.\n\nControls are well laid out with most of the outer face being the control button, and the top of the unit being the volume wheel - the wheel and control button share much of the duties, the only one I found odd was the volume wheel controlling call-waiting, I accidentally hung up on 2 calls over this. The control button activates voice dialing and answers calls very quickly, minimal lag.\n\nThe unit is not the smallest, but a decent small, compact size and light weight. The body feels overall solid as it's a 1-piece-design, but up-close there are elements that feel cheap and plasticky, the large seam in the middle flexes slightly when grasped, the light window flexes in easily, and the control button is a little loose in its travel so it rattles, it's slight but when it's up on your ear it's a noticeable sound. I had no problems at all with the small ear loop, no discomfort and it shaped easily.\n\nI don't like having things in my ear canal, so this alternative design was what I was looking for with the larger metal-grille-covered speaker that hovers just outside the ear canal. However, the plastic housing around it isn't rounded enough so a button press jams hard plastic into the side of the ear, a little painful.\n\nStatic is common here, whether sitting near the computer, laying on my side, or just standing right next to the phone, there'd be a little to a moderate amount of static which got frustrating after a while since I thought Bluetooth 2.0 in the headset and my phone is supposed to minimize that. The unit has good distance in my apartment, works through walls, but turns into a static farm when the microwave is running. I also found when I placed it in standby mode near my cordless house phone, that phone picked up a slight distortion.\n\nFinally, the thing that damned it in my eyes is sound quality. The speaker is generally loud enough, the mic slightly less so but fairly adequate pick-up. People can hear me, and I can hear them, but both the mic and the speaker sound are muffled and have tin-can effect. The underwhelming sound quality hampers natural conversation, there wasn't one call I made over 2 minutes that didn't have a \"what, what?\" moment on both ends because we could hear the other person saying something but it wasn't clear what that was. The sound quality is just not there with this one, and that's the whole point of it.\n\nEDIT - the next person who reviewed this reminded me of another drawback, there is a constant background hiss whenever the unit is active. Other BT headsets I've tried with this phone haven't had that issue.\n\nI was disappointed enough to send this back and ask for an exchange after just 3 days, I need better sound quality. Never the less, I've seen far worse performers out there that cost more, and people generally could hear me, and I them. When I next need a BT headset, I'll keep Cardo on my list to check in on, but the Scala 700 isn't there yet.", "summary": "Underwhelming sound, other design issues, but good battery", "unixReviewTime": 1173484800}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "12", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2007", "reviewerID": "A3977M5S0GIG5H", "asin": "B000HD79J0", "reviewerName": "Jane Ryan", "reviewText": "I bought this for my Treo 650 and so far I'm very impressed.

Very nice addition for this price.\n\nI've only had it for a week and it is holding up well (you get a padded velcro carrying case too) but my initial impression, to be honest, was that it seemed a little too fragile - again it's very small and light. So I've been skeptical but we'll see how it goes and if I have to return it I'll modify my review.\n\nPairing it up with the Treo 650 was fast and simple. It rings about 1 second after the phone rings also. The volume control on the unit is easy to use and can be turned up very loud. No complaints on the sound quality from anyone - my wife says it sounds a little like I'm on speakerphone but it's clear and understandable.\n\nUpdate: I had a chance to hear my wife using the headset finally and I'm very impressed - I think this headset is a keeper.

But, all in all, I am pleased with the Cardo Scala 700.  Occasionally, I do get quite a bit of static but that tends to be during the initial stages of the call while dialing.  Once connected, I rarely get static unless I am talking with my girlfriend <g>.  If I am in a noisy environment, people sometimes have a hard time hearing me but that is infrequent.  I have had some difficulty keeping this working with my Treo 700wx but I have never figured out if it is the cellphone or the Bluetooth headset.  Usually, if I \"refresh\" the headset on the phone, it will work fine once again.  The ability to easily switch it from one ear to the other without any hassle is also nice.  I am very impressed with the battery life.  I've had this for a month and despite sometimes not charging it for a couple days, I have never run out of juice.  Most importantly for me is the comfort.  Once I figured out how to adjust the ear band so there are no pressure points, I don't even realize I have it on; that's how light it is.  In fact, a couple times it has been on when I laid down in bed at night and I didn't realize it until I rolled over and put that ear on my pillow.  This is probably an odd comment but it is so lightweight that it almost feels cheap; in the same way as if you were to hold a cheap $5 Kmart Blue Light Special watch in one hand and in the other hand, you hold a Rolex, which feels more substantial.

Also the lack of noise cancellation and wind noise reduction on the other headsets made them only useful in the office or a quiet car.
