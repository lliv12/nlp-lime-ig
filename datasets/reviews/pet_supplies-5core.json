The photos in this chapter are invaluable and beautiful.\n\nCons --\n\n-- The \"conversational style\" is something a reader may like, or may not. I did not.  I want a clear explanation of a topic, not a conversation with someone who is trying to be casual, witty and amusing for reasons that don't help the explanation along.  The author is apparently trying, in part, to make the book entertaining enough so that the reader wants to learn about the subject; virtually anyone who buys this book, though, already has enough interest in the subject to sustain them through the reading of the book.\n\n-- The text on pages 130 and 131 is juxtaposed one with the other.\n\n-- The chapter that many readers would want to be the most complete and cutting-edge (that on care of clams in the aquarium, Chapter 5) is the least informational of the book.  The worst section in that chapter is probably the section on lighting.  This section includes absolutely no mention of lighting intensity in any usably objective terms (PAR or even lux), and wastes five paragraphs with a repetitive monologue of his subjective opinions on the 'looks' of various color temperature bulbs.  This chapter also includes a section on feeding, which spends ALL of its ten pages explaining how, how much, what and when to feed, only to conclude with the recommendation \"if you want to avoid all of this, just do what I've done for years (as have a gazillion other hobbyists) and only keep tridacnids in well-established, well-stocked aquariums with bright lights and don't worry about them.(p. 183)\"  It should also be pointed out that the book devotes most of Chapter 2 to why Tridacnids need not be fed at all!  Lastly, there was no information in the chapter on care of clams that is not currently what passes for common knowledge in the hobby.  While this is fine, in the sense that a book can be usefully a compilation of common practices, I expected more.\n\nIn summary: a book that most interested hobbyists will find is worth owning, in spite of the fact that it falls short of a bar that has been set by recent books in the hobby, including Wilkerson's \"Clownfishes\", Borneman's \"Aquarium Corals\" and the three volumes of Delbeek and Sprung's \"The Reef Aquarium\".", "summary": "Good, but a bit overrated by other reviewers", "unixReviewTime": 1267488000}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2007", "reviewerID": "A8GIK2FIUKVDG", "asin": "0978619404", "style": {"Format:": " Hardcover"}, "reviewerName": "Bobby", "reviewText": "finish reading this book in 2 days. this book covers pretty much everything from the caring to selection of tridacnid clams. i hv 5 clams in my reef tank. this book has really taught me a lot of things i hv overlooked such as feeding. i highly recommend this book.", "summary": "excellent book on clams", "unixReviewTime": 1198281600}, {"overall": 3.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2011", "reviewerID": "A14CK12J7C7JRK", "asin": "1223000893", "reviewerName": "Consumer in NorCal", "reviewText": "I purchased the Trilogy with hoping my two cats, age 3 and 5 would be interested.

It is meant as a TRAINING AID, to be used for no more than 2 weeks to help gain control of larger dogs that need help mastering leash etiquette. A person should ALWAYS consult a professional trainer for information on the proper use of pinch/prong collars.

I ran across the TV show recently when I switched TV to satellite.  I only wish I have found out about this earlier.\n\nA lot of the reviewers have covered almost every aspects, I just want to include a few points from my views from the shows.\n\nThe whole idea of Cesar's method is really simple, be the pack leader and the dog will follow, that will indirectly solve most of the unwanted behavior.  Although the execution is more complicated plus he has a pack of dogs to help him(this is a significant tool that most of us or other dog trainer lack of).\n\nI have owned Season 1, 2 & 3 in DVD, plus all the episodes I have taped from Season 4 to 7.  I cannot find any evidence of inhuman behavior or forces as described by some viewers.  Pinning the dog down is the most \"violent\" I have seen but even that, Cesar did not use force or tool, he was only making the dog in a laying down position.  In face, Cesar has been bitten quite a few times!!  And the touches he uses are for correction, if that's really hurting dogs, I am sure the dogs would have attacked Cesar already.\n\nAll dogs seems to responded to Cesar all the time and his touches are so effective, almost like miracles.  Let's not forget he is gifted with some ability such as feeling the dog's energy.  He always touch before the dog escalate.  Until we practice this, we'll never have as effective touch as he is, but the shows are definitely fun to watch, just don't expect the same result.\n\nThe last point I want to make is about the comment of his technique.  Some viewer regard it as old school.  It is probably true but then it will always works as long as following the leader is still in the DNA.  This is still true today for pack animal such as lions or elephants.  In fact, all those so called new technique does not work well for abused dogs.

My favorite twisting core exercise are russian twists where the band is attached to a wall or pole, you are facing to the side, and bring the other end of the band across your body with straight arms, feet planted which works your core, shoulders, and arms. Holy moley, this band is whooping my butt!\n\nPros:\n1) Strength: The strength of this band is exceptional. With the exercises that I do, it gives me plenty of resistance that does not change each time I use it. I can't wait until I get strong enough again where I can get more dynamic with this band.\n2) Comfort: It is smooth and \"soft\" making it nice to hold.\n\nCons:\n1) Width: the width makes it a little awkward to hold. Its not terrible or uncomfortable, but I notice it. I may become numb to it eventually. I would have made the band less wide but a little thicker.\n\nOverall, this band will do the job over and over. It seems robust and certainly has the right amount of resistance for a full variety of exercises. I used to love working out with these type of bands while running track and am happy to be able to get some of these to get back into those exercises.\n\nNote: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

Their prices compared to a number of retailers is also very good and shipping is free with at least $50 in purchases or a very reasonable $5.95 up to $50.\n\nA big note for those who purchased the 4oz Color Wash spray in the last year: Ranger discontinued several colors like Pesto, Mushroom, Terra Cotta etc. and also discontinued the 4oz size. Now there is only a 2oz size but it costs the same as the 4oz size so that works out to a 100% price increase. Thanks a lot Ranger.\n\nThe 2oz size does however spray a finer mist than the 4oz size. The 4oz sprayed lots of large drops regardless of the angle it was used at but was easy to transfer to a bottle with a finer spray.\n\nAll the color wash sprays work incredibly well on a number of materials. I've used it mainly on paper, card-stock and grass-cloth and the color on those has become permanent when dry. After spraying with the color wash sprays you can spray a fine mist of water to blend the colors further. The colors are really rich but they are less intense than the matching alcohol inks. When purchasing note that even the 2oz goes really far as you use relatively small amounts for great effect.\n\nA quick tip is to use a cardboard box layered with paper or card-stock when spraying. This prevents the spray from getting on other objects or furniture and also gives a two for one as you get some interesting looking paper in addition to the item you are spraying. Another tip is that the large drops normally emerge within the first three sprays so if you are trying to avoid a splotchy look use the spray on paper first before spraying your object.\n\nNote: Purple Twilight looks awesome blended with Lettuce or Sunset Orange or Butterscotch or Cranberry or Red Pepper.", "summary": "Ranger Color Wash Spray is Awesome", "unixReviewTime": 1304899200}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "09 7, 2010", "reviewerID": "A2GQS16NHRJGPM", "asin": "1612231977", "style": {"Color:": " 111"}, "reviewerName": "Cadd", "reviewText": "It's better than most, but I feel that Shun's quality went down over the years.

I was lost and confused and my own experience and someone who trains dogs \"professionally\" confirmed my suspicion.\n\nSee if any of these make any sense to you:\n\nFACT: Doesn't it make more sense to rely on your voice from the get-go to mark a command or a behavior instead of the sound of click-click? But that's clicker training for you. So, unless you are mute or have three hands (one to hold the clicker, one to hold the treats, and another to hold the leash), there is no need for a clicking device.\n\nFACT: In order to walk or train your dog, you just HAVE TO rely either on a leash, a collar, or a harness. Again, those tools are mandatory! Can you make the same kind of argument about a cheesy little box that makes a clicking sound? No, you cannot!\n\nFACT: It is nearly impossible to stop a determined dog from attacking people, other dogs, kids, or the cats with a bunch of treats in one hand and a clicking device in the other. But with a leash and a proper collar, yes, you certainly could. I see people scream at their dogs and they are still ignored. The stupid clicker doesn't even stand a chance!\n\nFACT: This method is more commonly used among dolphin and chicken trainers. The reason is simple: Try putting a leash on a dolphin or a cock and see what happens. They claim, since we cannot put dolphins on a leash, we'll get our clicker and use a bucket of fish in order to get their attention. But it's one thing to talk theory, and a totally different ballgame when we talk about REALITY! The reality is, don't you think if we could make dolphins and even elephants listen to us with a leash, that we would have by now?\n\nYou see, dolphins don't jump up on people, don't drag you down the street, don't lunge at dogs, and certainly don't terrorize your guests--but dogs DO!....\n\n... How can I add any emotions with the noise of a clicker? Don't you agree that there will be times when we need to sound firm, loud, praiseful, or just calm with our dogs?

It has also deterred people from barreling right up to pet her without asking which has made it much easier on us as owners to be able to introduce her to people slowly.  I don't clip a leash to this harness so I can't attest to it's performance in that area, but my dog has been able to wear this for 5-mile walks with no chafing or overheating.

The words are embroidered on very nicely- they aren't going to wear off, like I was expecting. The harness itself isn't thin mesh or something, it's padded (cotton? Idk) enough that it'd not going to rip.\n\nI have three things to say for prospective buyers: First, is your dog long-haired? If so, and you want this harness for the words (caution, nervous, etc), skip it. Their fur will cover up the message (my dog has short-to-medium fur and some of the fur on her neck folds over the edges of the harness). Try a leash instead maybe.\n\nSecond, the reason I'm only giving this harness four stars is that the back ring ripped off. the stitching on the straps is still fine (how did that happen), but the ring? somewhere in my backyard. We ate dinner outside one night, with my dog on her tie-out cable, she got caught around a post, jumped down a 4-foot wall... we heard her go 'oof' and then she ran off into the neighbor's yard, free as a bird. Still haven't found the back ring, but I didn't care about it in the first place, so. :O not really a problem for me\n\nThird: this works well as a front-attaching, no-pull harness! The front ring is in a good position, just high enough on my dog's neck for me to clip it to my her collar (for safety) at the same time when we go for walks. She's pulled and sometimes lunged and jerked the end of the leash, but the front ring is still there.\n\nI'm very happy that I can use this just like her other harnesses and keep the kiddos away until we can work on her fear aggression;;; It was a good investment :')", "summary": "Sturdy, comfortable", "unixReviewTime": 1471737600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "2", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2016", "reviewerID": "A1E9H406JN7NKE", "asin": "6041026573", "style": {"Size:": " Medium Harness 19-28inch Chest/Girth"}, "reviewerName": "Jessica Surrette", "reviewText": "The Caution harness is exactly what I was looking for.

FIRST this wasn't a big deal to me but would be a HUGE DEAL to someone else... there are no week per page views as stated in the description!!!! As for me... my biggest peeve and the reason I have to return this is it says it comes with a \"handy\" pocket. Handy it most certainly isn't. I'd be lucky to fit 2 pages in it folded in half, plus everything you try to put in it gets snagged on the back layer of the pocket since it's essentially just a tight folder pocket glued to the back page (If it expanded maybe i'd have kept it, but I think they were trying to keep it slim-lined and rendered it useless for me). Also considering the large size compared to the thinness and the fact that they say it'd be great in a purse etc. I was surprised at how flimsy it felt and could imagine it would get pretty beat up over the course of 17 months.

These treats look great (they look like little pieces of bacon) for the dog, heck, even for a human, ha ha. Of course when he heard the bag, my dog came running. My dog doesn't really drool at all, but after having him do a few tricks for me, he actually had a drop of saliva drop on my hand as he was waiting ever so patiently. In fact, he actually wanted it so bad that he stole a second treat from me before I could get him to do anything else.\n\nHe loves these treats, and I love seeing my dog happy.

I am 99% sure that they are even made by the same company as the manufacturing marks on the bottom are identical as is the packaging (containers only).  The only difference between the two is that the Beach Body version has colored containers and lids, this one has colored lids with a clear container.

This kit (healthy packers) says you can visit their website for a personal meal plan and recipes.  I think this is all you need to make this meal plan work.\n\nThe idea is simple.  You figure out your calorie level.  You then compare your calorie level to a chart that tells you how many of each color container you can have in a day.  For instance I can have 7 green containers (vegetables), five blue (fruit), six orange (protein), five yellow (carbs), one purple (fats), one dark orange (seeds) and seven grays (oils).  By the way, everyone can only have one purple which is fats.  They even have a list of each type of food and what foods are best to eat within that food category.  I don't know if I could stick to this list of foods and hope it is just a recommendation.\n\nI think with the help of their website you could achieve the same thing you would with the 21 day fix.

We have several dogs and go through a lot of dog food.  We've tried probably every brand you can think of, from low end bargain brand to really high end niche brands.  This stuff isn't cheap by any stretch. In spite of the price (it's not that it's overly expensive, it's just pricey and we have several dogs so go through a ton of dog food), this has become the only brand we'll now buy.\n\nLike I said, we've swapped out brands constantly. With three full time family members and a consistent pack of foster pups, trying to strike a balance between price and what the dogs like is rough.  They say you get what you pay for, but you can pay twice this much for some of the stuff at the vets office and yah, supposedly it's best for your dogs but it's hard to tell.  So over time, we started trying mixing the expensive stuff with the cheaper stuff. We've tried going to all moist food before. We've tried using canned food only (much much too expensive).  All this experimenting caused some problems - after the dogs started getting the canned dog food mixed in with the dry food, they got to be picky eaters. So picky that they would turn their noses up when we didn't mix in canned dog food.  After not giving them canned food mixed with the dry for a few days, they'd get used to it and start eating the dry normally. However we got the first bag from Vines for free.  It just so happened that we ran out of canned dog food two days after this arrived and we gave them the really expensive **** mountain food we had.  They would turn up their noses and only come back when they were really hungry. On day 3 of that, we ran out and just used this.  They immediately scarfed it all down (no exaggeration).  We actually had a small problem with two of them trying to eat the other's food they liked it so much.  We held off buying canned food b/c it seemed this would suffice. And sure enough, they were just as enthusiastic about it each day.  After a week when we ran out, we had yet to reorder the Nutro so moved back to the **** mountain and unless it was mixed with canned food, they had the same 'meh' response to it.  The new bag arrived, we swapped it out and viola', no more picky eaters.\n\nIt's really hard to tell in terms of energy level and the like what effect the food is having but there's no reason to think there's any downside to it. The vet hadn't heard of it when we first asked but the owners of the doggy hotel had and said owners reported similar results.  I won't get into unnecessary detail but in terms of digestion, there aren't any problems that we've encountered we have in the past.\n\nIn the end, it's a little costlier than low end dog food but our dogs absolutely love this stuff. Moreover, it ends up being cheaper b/c we don't need to mix in any canned food or anything else.  They love this stuff so much we jokingly call it puppy crack.  Anecdotal evidence isn't pretty weak and our sample size isn't huge, but 7 of our dogs have shown absolutely consistent love for this stuff.

This one actually IS better quality and I felt like it's well thought out as well.\n\nFirst, the ingredients.  I knocked off a half star because they said \"no grains\" but I felt like that was a little misleading... it still has chickpeas, split peas, alfalfa meal and potatoes in it.  So yes, it doesn't have wheat or corn... but it's still veggies/filler material.  The good news, however, is that lamb and chicken meal are the first two ingredients; so the bulk of what you are getting IS not grains.  And I do think chickpeas are better than corn and soy!  It has a large list of vitamins including Omega 6 and yeast; and also has a few herbs: rosemary, green tea and spearmint.  Overall I think the quality of the ingredients is pretty darn good!\n\nSecondly, the protein is high. REALLY high. Most \"high protein\" dog foods are in the 26% crude protein range; this one is 32%. The fat is a little higher than most too... most are about 14% and this is 18%.  So I do feel like this is much better in terms of a more natural canine diet.\n\nSo how does it pass on the taste test?  Very good!  It has small, uniform little bites... about 1/4\" wide and 1/8\" thick... good for large or small dogs.  And it was gobbled up super quick with no complaints... a definite A+ there.  It smells fine too... yay for that!\n\nAnd one minor added bonus: the bag is resealable. It has a ziploc, sturdy seal to it.  Minor, I know... but it's super nice so that mice and other random animals can't easily get back into it even if they happen to get into my storage area.  And even if my dog did, the plastic bag is pretty darn sturdy and thick, so I am not sure if he would be able to really get into it.\n\nNow another reason I took off a half star is because of the price. It's ridiculously expensive.  I can buy a 50 pound bag of junky dog food for 4 pounds of this.  I felt like it was quite overblown in price. But the quality IS nice; so if you are willing to pay for it....

I hope this helps someone.  Iams owned the Eukanuba brand before both the Iams and Eukanuba brands were sold to P&G, and then P&G sold both the Iams and Eukanuba brands to Mars in 2014.  It seems that Mars has decided to just go with the Iams brand name for their cat foods, although the Eukanuba dog foods appear to still be available.  The cat foods are no longer listed on the Eukanuba website.  Since the same manufacturer owns both brands, hopefully the Iams brand will be just as good.\n\nOriginal review:  I ordered a bag of Eukanuba Adult Cat Chicken Formula from Amazon. I used to feed the Eukanuba chicken formula and the Eukanuba lamb formula a few years ago with great results, but my local pet supply store quit carrying it. After I could no longer find Eukanuba, I switched to Iams Premium Protection for a while, but the local pet supply store stopped carrying that except in the small, expensive by weight bags, so then I switched to the Science Diet Mature Indoor formula after carefully checking the ingredients list. After Science Diet changed their formula to include cheap and nasty wheat gluten which is nothing except a cheap filler that adds no value whatsoever to the food, I am so glad I ordered the Eukanuba cat food. On Eukanuba once again after a few years, my cats' coats have become incredibly, noticeably silkier than on the other foods. My cat that is sensitive to wheat no longer has watery eyes and dirt stuck to the inner corners of her eyes due to the watering caused by wheat sensitivity, and her stools are not loose at all. Amazon has the Eukanuba chicken formula at a great price right now, and with free shipping, the price can't be beat. The best way to purchase these foods is in the largest size bags as it is less expensive by weight that way. I will keep buying Eukanuba whatever it takes to do so because it gives my cats the absolute best health.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2014", "summary": "THE ABSOLUTE BEST FOOD FOR CAT HEALTH", "unixReviewTime": 1388534400}, {"reviewerID": "AN0TRRRY1J75J", "asin": "B00004T2WR", "reviewerName": "Tina", "verified": true, "reviewText": "I've been looking for a chew/treat that will last my Welsh Terrier longer than 5 minutes and I came across these.

You know the drill: you have to trick your cat into entering the tiniest room in the home, containing both you and the dreaded carrier.  Closing the door triggers a biochemical reaction deep in your fluffy sweetheart's brain and next thing you know, a terrifying physical transformation has taken place and you're trying to corral a puffed up ball of volcanic anger and tiny whirling knives into the soft-sided rectangular prison of hellcat's worst nightmares.  If you survive this heroic endeavor, you face another challenge: how to prevent imminent escape.  Keeping the carrier in one piece is an equally important goal, of course.  Hellcats laugh in the face of most soft-sided carriers: their flimsy mesh disintegrates at a steely glance, thin nylon or canvas sides melt like butter beneath razor claws, and weak zippers part like the Red Sea if hellcat even thinks of making a break for it.  But hellcat has met her match in the Sherpa Ultimate Bag!  The only devastation my hellcat has managed to wreak on her Sherpa is in the form of a shredded fleecy mat.  This hellcat owner recommends replacing it with something more substantial, or tossing a blanket over it.\n\nYou could use a plastic carrier as transport, and I'm sure someone out there reading this is wondering that exact thing, but hellcats take even less kindly to carriers with barred doors that invite inquisitive dogs at the vet's office to inspect their mobile prison.  Hellcat wants to travel as inconspicuously as possible, and the multiple flaps act as iron curtains between their burning resentment and the world at large.  Strips of industrial-strength mesh near the top of the carrier let in plenty of oxygen, keeping hellcat's mind sharp and fresh...as sharp as the claws that will soon be shredding your tender flesh, and fresh as the blood that will soon be pouring from your wounds.\n\nSo, in other words, I highly recommend it!  I'd give it a solid 5 stars if the fleece mat was thicker and more hellcat-proof.\n\nIf hellcat has to stay in her carrier unsupervised for any length of time, I use twist ties to secure the zippers - just in case.  I've seen her do her worst to the carrier to no avail, but I don't like to take chances.  You can turn your back on hellcat, but then you'll always wonder what evil may be lurking in the shadows...\n\nOh, by the way, once hellcat has resumed her normal sweetie pie form, she will seek out her Sherpa for naps!!

First and foremost, I appreciated that it arrived in very Eco-friendly packaging. Many electronic devices come in large, plastic containers however, this company uses small cardboard. I think many people can appreciate an environmentally conscious business.\n\nInside the Package: The charger, the triple port charger manual\n\nSpecs and Features: 36W worth of power, high power output at 7.2A,  5V,  3 Ports (Universal USB ports), Adjusts automatically to your devices voltage setting and adjust output accordingly, Built-in over-current, over-charge protection, device weight of 1.25oz, 4 prongs secure device in car charger instead of the usual 2 prong on most, all 3 ports are easy to see due to Blue LED lighting\n\nThis charger is really valuable for the way we use technology today. Since the average person owns at least 2 devices that are in constant use, battery drainage is a huge concern. Along with that is the cost efficiency of having emergency chargers for all these electronics. That's compounded when you add family and friends into the equation.\n\nI can attest that after a long Thanksgiving holiday of using the Aukey, it's not only economical but a lifesaver. For example, we got lost on the way to my Uncle's house at night and our GPS was basically drained. Needless to say, it was reassuring to know that we could plug in the GPS, my Samsung Galaxy and my BF's iPhone all at once. We didn't even have to bother my mom who was busy talking on her cellphone to even notice we were lost.\n\nSeriously, this item is a must have for multiple device families or individuals. I especially think so for females. You NEVER want to be without power for communication devices while away from home.\n\nLast thing I'd like to mention is the ease of use and portability. Usually when a batteries dies, I'm scrambling to find the right external charger but not with this product. Just keep the Aukey in your car and you will always feel secure when commuting. It's very easy to use and I typically pop it in before hitting the road or at a red light. The fact that it's a Universal 3 port charger, is the by far the biggest selling point of this device.

It is among the smallest and lightest USB car charger with 7.2A output that I have seen. It is compatible with Apple and Android products.\n\nWhat do I like about this device?\n1) It is simple and compact\n2) It is user friendly and practical - it is plug and play\n3) It brings peace in our minivan  when my wife and I ride together, she uses one port for her phone, I use one, and we now have an extra port for the GPS. I will soon buy another one for the kids in the back seat so they can connect their iPad, iPod, and tablet.\n4) Each port emits 2.4 amps\n5) It charges your device rapidly and does not over charge like the ones you get during tech conventions for free\n\nWhat don't I like about this device?\nI have not found anything wrong with this device. It is great. It is so great that I have a feeling if I get one for the kids, they will be stuck on their electronics during long road trips. I really like this charger and I have benefited from it already.\n\nI would strongly recommend this device for a Christmas present even part of stocking stuffers.

Must've been around 1994 or 95.  Not too long after that, i got the tent.  I went through about 3 or 4 Litter Maids in that time, the motors kept working but they got too dirty and it was time for a fresh one, was my thinking.  That one tent outlived all those litter Boxes.  For me, the tent was great, I liked that it was light weight. It wasn't too flimsy, i could always easily unzip it and zip it back.  Sorry to hear the new ones are poorer quality, i hate when that happens. I have ordered one because i am about to start using a Litter Maid again after a couple of years with a Litter Robot, and when i took the tent apart last time, when i got rid of the last Litter Maid, one piece of the frame wouldn't go back on, i don't know why. But i have to say that overall, that one tent i had certainly held up well. My cat is not rough on things so that may be part of my success with this item on my first experience.  At that time, i had recently moved into an apartment that didn't allow pets, but we already had the cat before we moved in so since she is small, quiet and an indoor cat, i thought i would try and see if i could keep her under cover. The tent was perfect. The manager rarely came into my apartment, only for rare repair incidents, and when he would come, i would drap a table cloth over the tent. At worst, if he came in unexpectedly because of an emergency, i don't remember that happening but if it had, the tent itself would not suggest that there was a cat toilet there.  the tent always did a great job of keeping the odor contained. The tent was crucial to my situation and i have good memories of it.  If i'd known they were going to start making a poorer quality tent, i would've saved the other one. It wasn't worn out. Just one piece of the frame came loose and i tried to get it to go back but it wouldn't. I abandoned it too easily probably because i was switching over to the Litter Robot at that time. At first i gave the tent 4 stars just now, but i have to change it to 5 because my tent lasted about 12 years and was still in good shape when i stopped using it, and it really helped me out by minimizing the mess and odor of a cat box, and camouflaged my catbox so that my cover was never blown. I have ordered the current model of the tent and am definitely concerned after reading the bad reviews. It sounds like maybe there is not much quality control and maybe some units are better cut than others. one can only speculate.  i have my fingers crossed.  i will update my review if the assessment changes.\n\n10/3/10 Update\nA year ago when i wrote the above, i ordered a new one of these, despite bad reviews.  I wanted the litter Maid to be in a tent, so i ordered it.  It was unusable.  The cover was much too tight for the frame, and it's a really cheap zipper, the little zipper teeth don't mesh together around the whole length of the zipper.\n\nI assembled it when i got it and since then, a year ago, it's sat unused in the spare bedroom. It was really diffcult getting it set up because the cover is too tight, but what made it unusable for me is that in order to clean the litter box i need to unzip it partially so i can pull back the tent flaps and get to the litter box.  The zipper is so flimsy and the cover so tight that extreme pressure has to be applied to open or close the zipper, unlike my old original litter maid tent which was tight enough but not a big production to unzip and re-zip. i never even thought about it.  The zipper on the new model i have is so flimsy that it would never hold up under the kind of puilling necessary to open and close it.\n\nI just now disassembled it because i'm going to be moving back to my house and i am packing stuff up. It was really hard to unzip and the teeth of the zipper were unmeshed in places.  Very poor.\n\nI left the 3 star rating instead of 1 star because the original version of these was so good, lasting a cat's lifetime without problems, i want to give some notice to the fact that it's a good idea with a good design and low cost compared to the fancy litter box disguises, and to the longevity and sturdiness of the original one.  But i would not recommend buying this one, although Amazon will take it back if it's defective so if anyone wants to try it out, your mileage may vary.", "summary": "it's the only alternative", "unixReviewTime": 1250467200}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2009", "reviewerID": "A15OI6JXQSOFEF", "asin": "B00005MF9V", "reviewerName": "MissBanjo", "reviewText": "I'd owned a tent before years ago but had to discard it due to too many connectors breaking.

My 10 lb. cat has sat on the top of it and it has held up fine.  This is a wonderful tent.  It keeps the litter inside of the tent and off my floors.  It causes the cat to go up and down the ramp instead of jumping off the side of the litter box throwing litter everywhere.  I change the liner and lift the front of the cat box up with one hand and vacuum up all the left over litter once a week.  It also is amazing for containing the odor.  According to the reviews there must be a lot of lazy people that don't like to bend over to look into the tent to see what's going on.  I think it's pretty easy to get on my knees and check it out once in a while to make sure everything is running smoothly and to add more litter.

You get the idea.\n\nWe purchased this gadget in preparation for going out of town, and leaving the cats set up \"home alone\" for the weekend in a large unfinished basement.  They were used to eating and drinking from dispensers, and we always leave backup supplies just in case, so we had the input side of the equation covered.  The output side of things, however, tended to be less than ideal.  Our solution had always been multiple litter pans, and this device seemed like a great improvement.  We sent it up in a clear area, \"introduced\" the cats to its use, and went on our way.\n\nWhen we got back, we found that the cats did not have the positive response to this device we had hoped.  Not only had the device been turned upside down and emptied, but the batteries had been removed and scattered across the room.  But that wasn't enough.  Our industrious kitties had dragged whatever they could lay paws on over to the unit and buried it in random objects.\n\nWhile the details of what inspired such a profound \"statement\" were not completely clear, the message was extremely clear.  And so it sits, unused and unloved, spurned by our cats.  And to the list of peculiarities our cats have displayed, we must add the term \"Luddites\".\n\nIt is worth mentioning that no other animals had access to the area, including humans.  The box was flat on the floor.  There was no where for it to fall, and absolutely nothing in the vicinity to fall on it.  We are not subject to significant seismic activities.

I was using Fresh Step clumping, which I used in my other boxes, but after reading other reviewers recommendations I switched.  Now I use Tidy Cat Scoopable for multiple cats (Walm@rt) and it works fantastic.  With one cat, I dump the waste 2x a week - it's takes less than a minute.

I know Litter Maid also sells their own brand, but I you don't need to spend the extra $.  Spray the interior of the box and the rake with cooking spray, then put your Tidy Cat in and do not overfill.\nI researched this, the Litter Robot and the other automatic litter boxes before getting this one.  For the price, I think this is the best value at 20 percent of what the Litter Robot is selling for.  The Litter Robot has a much higher percentage of reviewers giving it 5 stars, but for the difference in price I decided one this model.  From everything I've read, this is the best performing of the Litter Maids, as well.

I've always found them to be great, but not very long lived.\nMy littermaids have serviced 2 cats at all times.  So, if you are a single cat house, you could reasonably expect 5-7 years of use from one of these.  The first unit's motor died.  The second, the spring in the power rake's cord broke, and couldn't reel in the cord anymore.  The third (my last) up and died, no warning or otherwise.  Just stopped running.\nMy first Littermaid was the original.  It lasted about 4 years.  The next was the original \"Mega Advance\" and was the best when it was working.  That only lasted about 3-4 years.  The last Mega (not advance) lasted about 5-6 years, but was very noisy.\nThis newer unit seems to be basically the same as the last Mega, but the motor is slightly more quiet and pushes the rake through the box at a faster clip.  Both nice improvements.  The included scoop has tines in it to clean out the rake, a great idea that only took 15 years....\nI've never run my Littermaids on batteries, always using the A/C plug.  If the power's out for a few hours, we can survive, or if needed, scoop.\nIf there was a way to make the system a bit more quiet it would be perfect.\n\nTips:\n1.  Don't over-fill the box.  Use the bottom (add litter) line as the top fill line.  If you fill to the top line, the system will not work as well.  This seems to be the #1 problem people have, adding too much litter.\n2.  Use a bit of cooking oil spray (Pam) on the bottom of the pan before you fill with litter.  I rarely clean ours, but when I do, I always spray the bottom of the pan and that really helps keep the box cleaner and helps keep the nasty stuff from getting stuck to the bottom.\n3.  Use high-quality clumping litter.  We get the big tub of Scoop-Away from Costco.  That lasts more than a month for us.\n4.  Re-use the waste containers.  They each should last a month or more.

It should not have been that difficult to make a better fitting plastic box or area where it is to be placed.\n\nA second problem is that the red \"fill\" line is misleading. If litter is filled up to that point (or even fairly close to it) the machine jams. As a result, to prevent jamming, one needs to fill the device with far below its full capacity. This, in turn, necessitates filling the machine with more cat litter than should be the case (i.e., twice a week instead of once).\n\nA third problem is that the rakes, many times, get jammed due to filling up with litter.

I got a plug in deodorizer and that took care of that problem.\nYou can't smell it anywhere else in the house.\nWith two cats I only have to empty the bin twice a week.\n\nCons:\nTrack inside box gets litter in it.\nLitter falls between the box and the litter receptacle.\nBox is difficult to do a thorough cleaning. I did get the whole thing wet and thought I fried the motor, but after it dried it worked fine again.\nThe low level of litter you need to use (I use less than they say and it works better) sometimes makes the pee stick to the bottom of the pan.\nNoisy.\n\nIf you are thinking of the Smartscoop see my review on that piece..\nPooper Flicker! I have more urine balls and fecal balls on the outside of the box.\n\nThe littermaid with all it's flaws is still the best product.\n\nTRICKS:\nUse a little less litter than they recommend\nUse a grocery bag in the litter receptacle and reuse receptacle over & over.\nSpray bottom of box with No-Stick Litter Box spray (or cooking spray)and it keeps the pee from gooing up on the bottom.\nDon't use the ramp as it makes more of a mess. (unless you have a kitten).\nWhen the machine stops running don't assume it is broken!!!!  There are two reset tabs at the end of the track on the receptacle end.  Flip up the lid and look on both sides of the track.  There are two little white tabs.  Push those and the box will reset.

I'll note that we didn't even try having this be the \"only\" litter box in our home! We had two others there too. We just wanted to see how well this worked. The storage container would get jammed in the open position, so that it did not do a good job of managing stench.\n\nHowever, we could have dealt with those issues. We could have cleaned the tines daily, and pushed down the lid ourselves regularly. The real problem was far more serious.\n\nFirst, understand how this works. The system sense motion and then X minutes after the cat has left the area, the tines move across, dragging any solids and clumps with it, pushing those items into the receptacle plastic box at the far end. Then the tines return to their original position and wait for a new visit.\n\nWhat happened with our unit would be that the tines would decide that they were ALWAYS ON and would keep going back and forth, back and forth, driving the poor kitties to distraction. There was no way they were going to jump in there and try to do their business while a set of metal tines was growling towards them!\n\nWe tried several times to fix this, but it really just wasn't worth it.

Well, maybe not that much more!\n\nMy friends tell me it looks like an MRI machine, and I can't disagree. The Robot's footprint is the same as the litter maid, except it has more height. It looks nice, works great, and my cat took to it immediately. It has built-in sensors that tell it when the cat is done, and if the cat goes near it during it's rotation, it shuts off for 10 minutes until it detects that it's safe to resume. Amazing!

I have only one small cat.  You can't beat not having to think about the catbox, it's almost like not having one at all--compared to the old fashion litter box.\n\nI first saw the Litter Maid in the LA Times Magazine around 1995, there was a full page ad, and you could pay in three installments, it was expensive, at least a couple hundred.  Catbox scooping depressed me so i ordered one.  Mine worked right out of the box.\n\nit's always tricky putting the right amount of litter in.  If i put too much, it just keeps recycling and raking until i take some out.  Following the instructions, i found that there would be too much litter and the machine would malfunction, but if i put it lower than the limit line, it would be fine.\n\nI had some kind of technical problem in the beginning, i can't remember what, and was pleased with their tech support, they took care of me, way back then.\n\nAfter a few years, it stopped working and i gladly got another one.  At some point, i began using Litter Pearls cat litter in it when that first came out.  That was yet another technical advance for my situation.  The Litter Pearls absorbed the urine so there was less stuff getting scooped into the box, and i was able to go even longer without being reminded of the litter box.\n\nIn the beginning, Litter Pearls was just regular little round pearls. Then, my pet store came out with \"lite tracking litter pearls\" which were not round. They made them irregular shaped and rough, to prevent tracking i guess. That new light tracking style did not agree with my Litter Maid.  It was too granular and it jammed up the mechanism.  My pet store stopped carrying the regular non-lite tracking kind of Litter Pearls, so i had to search for an alternative.\n\nThe combination of those little round litter balls and the Litter Maid did great things for my quality of life.  I did not want to go backwards into using the old fashioned kind of litter. I was ready to buy the regular Litter Pearls from the company in another state, (i called around) if necessary, or on eBay, but i was able to find another brand that had the round balls in a local store, the brand is Litter Secret, i couldn't find the product on the web though.\n\nAs long as i had the little round ball litter, not the lite tracking kind, my Litter Maid performed consistently.  The second one lasted several more years with never a mechanical problem.  Long ago, i got the tent. I would always use a tent with the Litter Maid.  For me, the less evidence of a litter box the better.\n\nThe Litter Maid rake did not clean easily and with my policy of not paying a lot of attention to the litter box, eventually the second Litter Maid got messy and the price had come way down on them, so i decided rather than clean it, i'd just get a new one.  the motor was still working fine, there was no problem with it after several years. I just didn't feel like cleaning it, was working lots of overtime and my job and felt i could afford a new one. I've had the third one for several more years, it has been very low maintenance, no mechanical problems, i just have cleaned it every few weeks, i'm not sure how often, maybe 2 weeks, maybe more, it seems long between times when i have to deal with it.\n\nRecently it stopped working.  The light was on but without warning, it wouldn't become active, it just sat there.\n\nI got a Litter Robot to replace it, because of the great reviews and decided i would try a change, since LItter Robot will let you return it for 60 days.  I'm still evaluating the Litter Robot, but there are some things that so far, i like better about the Litter Maid, one is, i didnt' have to regularly clean the Litter Maid, just take out the plastic containers, and then do a big cleaning once in a great while.  I think i'm going to have to clean the Litter Robot more often.\n\nThe Litter Maid plastic containers were easier for me to switch out and replace than the plastic bags for the Litter Robot, less struggle, less time spent bending over the \"dreaded area.\"  And more secure feeling because stiff plastic is thicker than a plastic bag.\n\nBeing inside the tent, the LItter Maid didn't have anything directly exposed to open air, whereas the Robot sits there with its door open and litter sitting out there in contact with the rest of the world.  Having said all of that, the LItter Robot is very cool.  More ingenious than the LItter Maid.  anyone could dream up the LItter Maid.  It would take a special kind of mind to think up the Litter Robot.  Watching it do its thing is something to behold, in terms of human engineering.  I was very happy with the LItter Maid, my three worked reliably and flawlessly each one for many years.  I didn't have to deal with tech support.  But again, i had only one small cat.\n\nOh, i almost forgot. My cat always liked to use only one side of the Litter Maid, so the waste would pile up on one end of the plastic container, causing it to fill up faster, only on that side, than it would if it had been distributed evenly.  When it fills up and doesn't close completely, that's when i can smell it and i go into action to change the container, but i alway would find that half the container wasn't used, it was empty on one side, full on the other. This never affected the mechanical performance of the Litter Maid itself.\n\nUpdate:  10/3/10\n\nI have just retired my most recent Litter Maid which i started using a year ago.  I was having a very hard time with it.  It worked well as far as the motor and everything it's supposed to do, but the problem  was with the litter (crystals). The crystals were getting saturated in only about 4 days and if i didn't change the litter, my cat would pee on the floor cover that i kept under the litter maid.  That is way too frequent to have to deal with cat sewage, by my standards.  Urine was getting all over the box and under the box. I thought the litter maid was leaking but couldn't find any openings.  It took me a long time to figure out that my cat's hyperthyroid condition was causing her to excessively urinate.  When i realized it, about two months ago, i doubled her medication and the problem has gone away. but she continued to refuse to use the Litter Maid, i think it must've developed an odor because of all the urine all over it, i tried to wipe it off but far from perfectly i'm sure.  Even though the crystals weren't saturated at all, she was peeing on the floor cover.  So i have just replaced the Litter Maid with a ScoopFree automatic box. So far it's working great. I took the Litter Maid outside, cleaned it as best i could with diluted Simple Green spray, it looks ok, i put it some big plastic bags and will keep it in the garage.  It has been working very well.  A real trooper.\n\nI want to say that i appreciate the Litter Maid, it served me well for about 16 or more years, about 5 of them over those years, two were thrown out not because they wore out but because they were dirty so in my experience they have worked well. I never had a problem with the motors, and i was always impressed at the way it just kept raking over and over, never giving out.\n\nThis is different from some peoples' experience.  I want say that i have always used Litter Pearls crystals in the litter Maid, not clay or clumping litter, and that may be why i haven't had the same problems some have had.  I would recommend using crystal litter with it, but in my experience, it had to be the rounded kind, not the trackless/lite tracking kind which are irregularly shaped.  The trackless kind were too abrasive and jagged for the litter maid, they jammed it up, causing the rake to come to a painful creaking halt in mid cycle. But the rounded ones work well, they just aren't easy to find because people tend to prefer lite tracking litter.  But other than that, the crystals have always worked great in the Litter Maid.", "summary": "not perfect but i've loved them", "unixReviewTime": 1190419200}, {"overall": 1.0, "vote": "2", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2007", "reviewerID": "A1UYOAIU8ORCOQ", "asin": "B00005MF9T", "reviewerName": "csmveg", "reviewText": "I actually won this litter box in a drawing.

Every so often I'll have to use the special litter scoop that comes with it to scrape some \"left over\" off the rake. It does make a noise but it's not that loud.

Yes and no... If you still are willing to maintain a litterbox every couple days yes... If you are not willing to do this, it won't help much to get this type litterbox.  My years of previous experience with cats and boxes have proved quite informative so I'll try to give you the low down and insight that hopefully will help.\n\nFirst, multi cat homes need checked daily, not necessarily changed, just checked.  A large cat can't aim the center of the box, especially portly cats.  They being large cats end up hitting the very end of the litter area with urine then the machine sweeps and it then clings a clump stuck to the plastic.  This only happens once in a while when the cat is facing the machine area and his hind end toward the hopper.  Otherwise, the other reason is a not totally clumped chunk of whatever that gets caught in the teeth then rides back to the original position where it dries and then becomes like concrete.  A good brand of litter helps cure some of those problems.\n\nThrough trial and error, Everclean litter is a great alternative to the brand that littermaid sells ... sold in pet store and amazon.\n\nIf you have dogs, place the unit with the hopper away from where your dog can pull it out.

I mean cleaning completely, with a new coat of scotch-guard on the pan surface and fresh litter refilled.\n\nAnd that may not make a difference if you have a cat that aims for the plastic tines. And cleaning those is kinda nasty. I've noticed that a new version is out with metal tines.  Maybe the manufacturer's cat had good aim too.\n\nSince writing the review below we got a cat with exceptional aim. He could jam up that thing in one session. We were cleaning it every day, and finally opted this year to get a plain old deep rectangular litter pan with scoopable litter and ditch the Litter Maid.  Heck - we were in cleaning it everyday anyway due to our 'artistic' new cat.\n\n---------------------------------------\nI have three cats, all indoor, and you can imagine I've tried about every kind of litter to come up with something workable for both me and the cats.\n\nI've had a LitterMate (the larger size) for almost a year now and think this is the next best thing to sliced bread. we liked it so well, we've recently gotten the regular sized one as well since the cats were giving the one we had such a workout.\n\nPros:\nOur dogs no longer go litter-diving for 'snacks'. The mechanism scares them and most of the contents are now hidden away in the plastic container.\n\nThe cats are only fascinated by the workings of the litterbox and had no problem adjusting. The oldest was 6, the youngest 5 months.\n\nScoopable litter + three cats previously meant 2-3 times a day  scooping the litterbox. One LitterMate + three cats = 2-3 times a week tray dumping.  The trays are easily reused, making them more economical.\n\nThe box itself has been dumped and cleaned every other month. The comb is held in place by two screws and is easily removed from the engine to be cleaned. I soak the bottom pan and comb in an antibacterial  cleaner solution, and after it's dry use Scotchguard on both.\n\nThe house I live in is small - there are few places to hide litterbox odor. This does it effectively.\n\nOne of our cats like to dig his way to China when he covers his stuff.  I was worried that the scratches on the bottom of the pan would cause more sticking than normal, but a generous coating of Scotchguard keeps things moving along in spite of the battle scars in the LitterMaid.\n\nCons:\nYes - litter does escape underneath a little, but with the activities of three cats we were always vaccuming around the litter box anyway - no difference there.\n\nThe litter flinging problem happened once to me - every time afterwards I threw the garbage bag on top of the tray while I removed it, then just tipped it into the bag. Again, no biggie.\n\nTips:\nThose lines in the litterbox aren't kidding - don't fill the box over the red line, or the motor will jam.\n\nWhen they say Premium clumping litter, they mean it.  The alternative is a constantly jammed motor.\n\nWhenever you empty the tray, pass the scraper through the pan to make sure that nothing escaped the comb along the bottom. Those spots can build up and cause a jam too.\n\nIf stuff sticks too often to the comb or bottom, it usually means it's time to dumb the entire box and clean and re-coat it with nonsitck spray.

I'd simply use one trap over and over again, and use a regular grocery bag as a trap liner.

The one thing no one likes to do, though, is somebody else's bathroom chores.  So originally, I bought it out of consideration for others, but I am so thankful for the efficiency of this device!\n\nOne of our cats is a large Maine Coon who is into his elder years, so he has some kidney issues and can leave large amounts of liquid in the box.  I quickly learned to leave the Litter Maid on manual so that the litter has time to absorb and clump.  Twice each day, I simply flip the power switch to the ON position and watch the machine do all the work that I used to loathe.  Once the cleaning cycle is complete, I turn the power switch to off and sprinkle a layer of baking soda over the waste in the bin, then walk away.\n\nAs mentioned by other reviewers, I also use Fresh Step litter.  Yes, it's expensive, but you will need very little of it in the Litter Maid.  Also, due to the volume issues mentioned above and the size of my cat, I learned to add a LITTLE BIT of the Fresh Step blue crystals to the Litter Maid about twice per week, even though the instructions advise against crystals in the machine.  After a cleaning cycle, I simply sprinkle about ONE CUP of crystals along the resting position of the rake.  This works perfectly to keep the clumping litter from sticking to the rake.\n\nIf the machine is on autopilot and repeating its cycles, that almost always means you have too much litter in the box.  In the case of large or older cats with kidney dysfunction, it MIGHT mean the clump is too large for the device to move efficiently.  The machine then returns to starting position and begins the cycle again.  Presumably, the engineers were betting that the move/restart/reimpact approach would help to break down larger clumps.  If you have this problem, I highly recommend switching to manual mode, as I have done, rather than giving up on the machine.\n\nMy cats were very suspicious of the Litter Maid at first, but once I switched to manual mode they adapted happily.  Now the big cat greets me with a cheery monologue each morning and leads me into the cat room so that I can praise him for using his box properly and flip the power switch to clean it up.\n\nOur long-haired cats are much cleaner, happier and healthier.  So am I!  Inhaling all that litter dust when cleaning the standard litter box was always very hard on me, as I have complications with allergies AND inflammation.\n\nOTHER TIPS:  I buy baking soda in 5 lb. bulk bags at the restaurant supply (Cash n Carry, dunno if you can get it at Costco, etc) and store it right next to the Litter Maid in a food storage, air tight container, along with a scoop for dispensing it into the waste receptacle.  I also buy food service gloves at the same store (box of 100 for less than $5) and always wear gloves when I'm doing kitty chores.", "summary": "ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT", "unixReviewTime": 1158537600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "68", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "04 17, 2006", "reviewerID": "A2Q89DEW2Y91A7", "asin": "B00005MF9U", "reviewerName": "Cynthia Raxter", "reviewText": "I have 5 cats.

About once every two days, I just pull the full one out and tie it closed, dress over the litter and make sure the rake is clean. They give you a tool to clean the rake. I use a regular litter rake to make sure any used litter is scraped loose from the bottom of the pan. (One of my boys uses the same spot for every urine break. The litter in that corner sticks to the bottom of the pan.) This whole process takes about 5 minutes.\n\nAbout once a month, I Dust Buster the mechanical parts and use a bathroom wipe as needed. I have always used disposable blue plastic-lined bed pads under litter boxes so any accidents are easy to take care of. You can get them in the Depends aisle at the drug store -- or search for \"underpads\" here at Amazon. Accidents are few and far between with the LitterMaid as the sides are very high.

When I first got the Littermaid, the cats used 5 boxes in different locations around the house. At first I left 3 of them in place.

You can get them in the Depends aisle at the drug store -- or search for \"underpads\" here at Amazon. Accidents are few with the LitterMaid as the sides are very high. My largest cat is a neutered male that weighs 16 pounds.\n\nI had one dear sweet elderly princess that would, at times, stand in the box with her back-end over the storage container. Until she passed away we just didn't use the lid. The Littermaid even kept her from peeing on the floor. God bless her. Before the Littermaid, she was notorious for not wanting to use a box anyone else had used. We happy she at least approved of the Littermaid's cleanliness. :-)\n\nI clean the whole box about twice a year. The bottom pan pops off. I spray it with bathroom cleaner -- Scrubbing Bubbles -- let it sit a bit and then rinse it with a garden hose. I vacumm the upper (mechanical) part of the pan and wipe it down good with a bathroom cleaning wipe. (The rake will unscrew from the motorized arm and I could soak it in a bucket of Clorox water - but this is a litter box and I am not that fastidious.) All this takes about 20 minutes. Make sure all the parts are bone dry before reloading with new litter.\n\nSome people have had problems with the automatic mechanism jamming, etc. The trick is to not overfill the litter pan when adding clean litter. There is two marks on the bottom pan: Full and Add. Keep the level between the two marks. I used a ruler and a red Sharpie to extended the \"FULL\" mark all the way across the pan so it was easier to tell where the \"DO NOT GO ABOVE THIS LINE\" was.\n\nIt is also important to use premium litter. I have had best results with \"Scoop Away\" litter. Scoop Away worked better than Tidy Cat Scoop or Arm and Hammer Scooping litter -- the granules seemed to be a bit larger so clumps did not get dense and stick to the rake. I have never tried the Littermaid litter. I have never tried or needed to use silicon spray or Pam cooking spray to make the bottom of the pan slicker as suggested in the owners manual.\n\nEven though premium litter costs more than a store brand, it last longer with the LitterMaid. Because the waste is scooped automatically 10 minutes after the cat uses the box, the litter stays cleaner. Even with 5 cats, we use 7 pound bucket of litter every 2 months or so.\n\nI don't think the sound is too obnoxious -- much quieter than a washing machine or vaccumm -- about equal to a dishwasher. I have the box in the laundry room next to the kitchen. If I hear it working, I say, \"Thank God.\"\n\nTo get your cats to accept the new litterbox very fast: set it up with litter beside your present box, but leave it unplugged. Manually scoop it for a day or so. Be diligent. Don't scoop the old box at all. Then, plug the Littermaid in, and turn on the switch on to rake, and off when done. Do this for a day or so. Then start leaving the switch on for a few hours and off for a few hours. If the cats go in the Littermaid while the switch is off, go turn it on after they are done and admire their progress. Continue to keep the Littermaid clean all week and leave the old box smelly. Cat naturally prefer a clean box.\n\nI had 18, 19 and 20 year old cats, feral cats, shy cats, dominant cats and nervous cats all learn to use the box with no problems. I found a cat in a parking lot in June. As far as we could tell he had never been indoors. He was using the Littermaid by the end of the week. One of my cats was a neighbor's cat. He disappeared for a year. They moved. He came home from his walkabout and adopted me. He comes inside now to go. (Maybe it is his way of marking his territory?) Whatever -- none of the cats I've known have ever objected to having a clean litterbox. I don't much blame them.\n\nAnother reviewer said a Littermaid should not be used with kittens under 6 months old. If you were concerned, just leave the switch off and then turn it on when you want the box to be scooped. None of my kittens have had any problems tripping the sensor or getting out of the box when the rake started.\n\nIf you have a cat that is terrorized by a dominant cat and you use two litter boxes -- you may want to leave the scaredy cat his \"safe zone\" box in place. When I first got the Littermaid, the cats used 5 boxes in different locations around the house. At first I left 3 of them in place. They got less and less use, so I decommissioned one after another -- probably over 6-8 months. Now we just have the Littermaid. I have used the same LM900 Mega since March of 2004.\n\nWith one cat it may not be worth the financial investment to have an automatic litter box ($100-150 US). It has added an hour to my life every day -- plus added to my cats' health and well-being. I consider it a very good purchase.\n\nBest of luck to you and your kittens!", "summary": "Littermaid -- better than scooping for you and the cats", "unixReviewTime": 1145232000}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "04 13, 2006", "reviewerID": "A1YW8KJS3XP8FM", "asin": "B00005MF9U", "reviewerName": "Tee Leachi", "reviewText": "I owned one of these for two years and loved it.

But I foolishly bought it anyway, at $180 no less (trying to support the locals, you know).  It was bad.  The rake could only end up scooping half the length of the pan before it would bog down and stop and try again, unsuccessfully.  I had filled the litter up to the fill line as I have always done.  But it turns out that it can only handle scooping when the litter volume is at the minimum fill line or less.  Not practical.  And even then it would often bog down.

It took a few trials to find a litter that worked well but I settled on Scoop Away. Yes, as some reviewers have mentioned, sometimes it does stick to the bottom and you will have to use the scooper to scrape it up or clean the rakes sometimes. Then, I just turn it on and off and it will rake everything up.  It only takes me a few seconds to check for any stuck spots or even out the litter, turn it on and off to make it rake and then add a little new litter to the top (so the cats think it's nice and clean). :-) It's not completely \"no work\" but it is a lot less work than a \"manual\" litterbox and stays smelling cleaner than manual boxes.  I do use larger plastic grocery bags in the receptacle. It's a lot cheaper than throwing away receptacles every 3-4 days and it's alot easier to clean. Believe me, I do not like trying to pry those receptacles out when it is completely full.  You have to stick your fingers inside to grab onto it (YUCK!) and it's heavy and hard to get out sometimes dumping litter and stuff all over the place (double YUCK).\n\nThe Seller on Ebay was selling the one I bought with a \"super charged\" motor (which is in the electrical cord). It worked pretty good for almost a year. Apparently, unlike the \"normal motor\", the stronger motor kept it from resetting sometimes when it would hit clumps that were too big for it.  It would attempt to plow right thru which sounds like a good thing, but it wasn't. Apparently the gears and/or sprokets which move the rake along are made of plastic and within a year they were stripped. It started out making a spinning sound once in awhile but would eventually go ahead and rake. One day I came home to a god awful sound. I found the rake stuck right in the middle of the box, gears just spinning and making a heck of a racket. This was enough to scare away ALL 4 cats from the ONLY litterbox. Needless to say we had some accidents. 3 of my cats \"recovered\" and would go back to the disconnected box, but my 20 year old cat was traumatized and refused to use it. So I had to set up the manual box. I'm STILL working with her trying to get her to stop going elsewhere because of this.\n\nI took the Littermaid to a repair shop and they knew immediately that the gears were stripped because they'd seen it before. They said they couldn't repair it because they couldn't get parts.\n\nI contacted the Ebay Seller who said it was still under warranty. I had to pay shipping to and from the Seller though which was not cheap. The 2nd supercharged Littermaid started doing the same thing after less than 6 months and the Seller says this one is not under warranty. Apparently, the warranty does not extend to the replacement that they sent me which I think is a rip-off considering how expensive these things are.\n\nWhile the 1st Littermaid was being repaired, I went ahead and bought another \"regular\" (not supercharged) Littermaid from Petsmart. I've had it 8 months and had no skipping problems so far. I think the \"supercharged\" motor caused all my problems, but KittenKaboodle refuses to acknowledge this and refused to warranty the 2nd box that they sent me.\n\nSo, overall it's great when it works, but it could use a few improvements. The bottom of the pan needs to be made of something more \"non-stick\" so the rake can get thru some of the larger wet spots and/or the gears need to be made of something stronger to be able to take a stronger motor that can get thru the stuck on clumps (and not strip the gears). Also I would like to see a slightly larger receptacle on the larger models. They are made for a multi cat household but with only one litterbox it fills up pretty fast.

I had very little difficulty training the cats to use the new box; I just followed the simple instructions that came with the Littermaid.  The only difficulty I had in getting the cats accustomed to the new box was a teenager who thought it hillarious to yell boo at a cat as it watched the box clean itself.  Needless to say, that cat took a little longer getting used to the LitterMaid and the teenager got the privelege of cleaning the old box.\nJust as it advertises, 10 minutes after use, the \"sifter\" runs from one end of the box to the other, lifting the clumps and depositting them in the container at the end.  A few times it had a little difficulty with a very large clump and I heard it reverse and try again several times before successfully completing the trip.  I do have a problem with litter being dumped on the floor, either by an energetic cat or the sifter pushing litter in front of a clump and over the edge.\nDon't start thinking this will reduce how often you have to deal with a litter box.  You still have to empty the container daily, add/rearrange the litter daily and probably vacuum frequently.  It misses the really small clumps so you'll have to sift once in a while.  However, it only takes a minute to do these tasks and it really keeps down the smell.

A. Luster", "reviewText": "Give me a break, I have three cats. This thing is a godsend. I can't believe people complaining about it breaking down in a few months or it being overloaded. Read the manual is all I can say. I have bought about four of these units. I started buying them when they first came out and they cost about $200 plus shipping. They have vastly improved the durability and features, and the cost has dropped dramatically. If you adhere to the rules of not over filling it with litter and checking the receptacle box daily you will find it works very well.\nI will admit with three cats I don't usually get them to last much past two years, but the cats health and my sanity are in great debt to LitterMaid. It is well worth the money for me not to have to clean a litter box out at least three times a day. I have also noticed the cats are cleaner and the smell is much better. If your cats tend to urinate in one spot you may want to take a litter rake and loosen it once in awhile. A large accumulation hardened to the plastic bottom could cause problems with it raking properly. Any time that has happened I could hear the box repeatedly trying to rake the litter. I just went in, unplugged the power, and took a scoop to the clumps. It always worked fine after I plugged it back in. Seldom as that occurs, I don't mind a bit.\nI usually dump the receptacle box contents into a plastic bag every couple days and throw it in the trash. That allows me to stretch the use of the plastic receptacle boxes they include when you buy it. When I replace my unit about every two years I usually have receptacle boxes left over. Should you use them more than me you can buy more at pet stores like Petco. The last set I got included air filters for the receptacle boxes. The odors were always greatly reduced before since the receptacle box encloses what is raked out of the litter box. Now with an air freshener I don't notice even a hint of the smell you get with a standard litter box. You can even remove the bottom easily and rinse it out with water.\nI'm sorry if I find it hard to believe all those that have rated this negatively. My own experience with these over the last eight- years and four LitterMaids tells me that perhaps they overfilled them or neglected to check them. You can't have the same attitude of using a regular litter box. Many people fill their regular litter box up so they can slide for awhile without raking it. You can't do that with a LitterMaid. A half to three quarters of an inch of litter is plenty. And it is best to use litter like Arm & Hammer Multi-Cat clumping litter. We have used it without any trouble for years. Then you just pour in a little more every day or two. Follow those rules and it should work fine for at least a couple years.\nBe sure you buy a model that is appropriate to the number of cats in your household. You can't expect to have three cats use the cheapest model and then not have any problems. We always buy the heavy duty model since we have three cats. It would have been well worth if I paid two hundred dollars and it had only lasted a year. My boxes have lasted two years so I figure the cleaniliness and me getting a break from all the litter box cleaning is well worth the cost.", "summary": "I have three Cats!", "unixReviewTime": 1079049600}, {"overall": 1.0, "vote": "4", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2003", "reviewerID": "AKDXXW89ZLCJS", "asin": "B00005MF9U", "reviewerName": "Cybele A.

I managed to repair the thing once - (I'm a mechanical engineer so it was easy taking the thing apart and repairing it, but it wasn't exactly a hygienic task!) - by removing the gears and reshaping the plastic teeth. It lasted another couple months like this, but since the plastic teeth were already shot, when the gears started slipping a second time, I just tossed the thing (metal gears would have prevented this problem or even LitterMaid selling replacement plastic gears would help).\n\nFor those of you who still have a Litter Maid and hate changing the trap, I discovered a method to make the task easier and much more pleasant. I'd simply use one trap over and over again, and use a regular grocery bag as a trap liner. When the trap was full, all I'd do was lift the grocery bag (leaving the trap locked in its position), tie the handles and toss, and then replace with a new bag. The same plastic trap would last for several months (and I'd only end up tossing it if it got dirty). Since you never have to deal with removing the trap, it doesn't get cracked and you never have to buy replacement traps (I still have about 8 of the 12 original ones that came with my Litter Maid)\n\nOverall my experience with the LitterMaid was a love/hate thing. It was my first exposure to automatic litter boxes so it was great that the cats always had a clean litter box to use. But I'd never buy another one because of the problem of the plastic rakes getting clogged with sticky cat leavings (yuck!). When I'd have to clean it, it was much more of a disgusting operation than a month of scooping cat litter with a regular scoop!\n\nI'm in the process of looking for another automatic litter box and the best so far seems to be Litter Robot.

We tried moving it, but cats are funny about change...they kept going where it had been previously located.)\n\nAfter several months of use, when it became apparent that it was causing more work, we timed how long we spent dealing with the unit. When we were scooping by hand, we were spending about 10 minutes a day getting the litter clean. With the machine, we were spending, on average, about 20 minutes per day. Time and work saver? I think not.\n\nAn additional problem we had was a disruption of the infrared light sensor, so that the box started cleaning and would not shut down. It just kept cycling time and again. We fixed it by cleaning the sensors, but the problem continued to reappear every time a cat decided to aim for anywhere other than dead center.\n\nThe only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it did save on the amount of litter consumed, however that was offset by the need to get a premium brand.

Easy to remove litter tray and throw away or dump and re-use.  Keeps litter relatively clean, but has issues.\n\nThe bad:  VERY sensitive to litter type and amount.  We went through several brands of \"Premium\" litter until we found one that clumped hard enough and fast enough to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan, interestingly enough it was the cheapest brand...  Filling the pan with litter beyond the lowest level allowed caused the rake to jam on the backsweep, which makes it cycle endlessly.  Any litter sticking to the bottom of the pan causes the rake to jam and re-cycle repeatedly.  The rake tines become clogged with used litter after a bit.  The rake gets most of the big stuff though the unit does require a hand going-through fairly often, but it's bearable because the litter needs to be changed out at that point anyway.\n\nThe worst part is the longevity.  We had both of the units fail after almost exactly one year.  The first unit had the sensors fail, it would no longer detect when a cat had been in the pan and therefore would not activate the cycle.  The second unit had the motor fail, probably due to endless cycling for one of the above reasons.  That's over $200 spent for devices that lasted a year.

My second LitterMaid has been going strong since I replaced the last one well over 2 years ago.\n\nThe most important thing I can suggest is using *premium* clumping litter.  I've been very happy with the ScoopAway brand.  Cheap litter breaks apart and makes a mess.  The next thing is to keep the litter level below the \"max fill\" line.  Too much litter causes the rake to bog down.  Also, cooking oil spray (pam) works very well to keep the clumps from sticking to the bottom.\n\nI use the \"disposable\" catch pans over and over until they crack.  I can normally get 2 or 3 months before I consider changing it out.  I can't imagine tossing it out after one filling.  That's a big expense, and a waste of money and a perfectly operable item.  I don't use a liner/bag in the catch.  Just dump the dirty stuff into a bag and out to the trash.  I have two cats and they can fill the catch-bin in 2 to 3 days.

Also, it is not a perfect cleaner, and will leave little bits that need to be scooped by hand every few days.

It's the favorite toy for a Coton de Tulear I know.  When I throw it, he'll chase it over and over and over again.  He loves the larger version even more because it has louder \"giggles\" and he'll actually stand on it and twirl it over and over like a circus dog!  It's hilarious to watch him have so much fun.  The sound that comes out of this silly ball makes me laugh and I've seen many dogs \"laugh\" at it as well.  It can be a very addictive toy and it's a wonderful interactive toy that will give you lots of time to play and bond with your dog.\n\nThe Coton I mentioned has a little sister who has no interest in it whatsoever so, it's clearly not for every dog.  But, I find this to be true of most toys.  As others have written, it doesn't hold up to tough chewing and eventually, a dog will be able to get the \"giggly\" out of the Wiggly.  However, if you use it as you would any other ball you'd throw, it can last quite awhile.  I think it's a better toy for small or medium size dogs.  Larger breeds like Labs,  will definitely tear it apart much more quickly but, they'll have a fun time doing it.\n\nMost toys require some supervision and this is true of the Wiggly Giggly as well.  If a toy has a squeak, most dogs will do all they can to \"kill\" the squeak and you don't want them swallowing it.  But, if your dog likes squeaky toys and likes to chase balls, it may become his or her new favorite play thing.

Another thing I really liked was that you can adjust all the settings, you can set how sensitive you want the collar to be to the barking, how strong you want the vibration or the shock. Or shut the shock feature off totally. It charges with in an hour with the usb cable and my dog wore it for a week strait so far and I didn't need to re-charge it.

I'd be lucky to fit 2 pages in it folded in half, plus everything you try to put in it gets snagged on the back layer of the pocket since it's essentially just a tight folder pocket glued to the back page (If it expanded maybe i'd have kept it, but I think they were trying to keep it slim-lined and rendered it useless for me). Also considering the large size compared to the thinness and the fact that they say it'd be great in a purse etc. I was surprised at how flimsy it felt and could imagine it would get pretty beat up over the course of 17 months.

I am 99% sure that they are even made by the same company as the manufacturing marks on the bottom are identical as is the packaging (containers only).  The only difference between the two is that the Beach Body version has colored containers and lids, this one has colored lids with a clear container.

This kit (healthy packers) says you can visit their website for a personal meal plan and recipes.  I think this is all you need to make this meal plan work.\n\nThe idea is simple.  You figure out your calorie level.  You then compare your calorie level to a chart that tells you how many of each color container you can have in a day.  For instance I can have 7 green containers (vegetables), five blue (fruit), six orange (protein), five yellow (carbs), one purple (fats), one dark orange (seeds) and seven grays (oils).  By the way, everyone can only have one purple which is fats.  They even have a list of each type of food and what foods are best to eat within that food category.  I don't know if I could stick to this list of foods and hope it is just a recommendation.\n\nI think with the help of their website you could achieve the same thing you would with the 21 day fix.

And they're still going strong, it seems, despite the rise in \"there's an app for that\" thinking.\n\nI like to look at one month at a time, and this planner gives me exactly that: One month spread across two 8x10 pages, with room for additional notes.  The pages are a bit thin (not the best when you like to use a pencil and erase a lot), and there are a lot more pages than you might think for a \"12 month planner\".  That's because they've given you a 13th month (Jan. '17) just for yuks, as well as the rest of the next year spread out over another couple of pages, plus many more blank pages for \"Contacts\" and \"Notes\", additional pages with when each holiday will be for the next 3 years or so, and other odds-and-ends.  An attached flexible strap can be used to hold the book together as you begin, presumably, to stuff it full of additional scraps of paper (?), and the whole thing is protected by a fancy-stock black cover, with embossed lettering.\n\nIt remains to be seen, of course, how well this thing will withstand the treatment I'm capable of giving my planners through the year!\n\nIf you are looking for a monthly planner for 2016, you could do much worse than this one from the At-A-Glance folks.", "summary": "Tried-and-true: At-A-Glance Monthly Planner", "unixReviewTime": 1446163200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2015", "reviewerID": "A1UQUDT2Q0YENM", "asin": "B00005Q7CJ", "style": {"Pattern:": " M42"}, "reviewerName": "Michael", "reviewText": "I like this monthly planner. It's pretty simple. Each two page spread is a single month. There is a good size margin in the inside of the calendar so none of the days are too close to the spine. There is a strip to the right of the calendar for notes. Major holidays are listed. Depending on how the days fall, there may be one or two split boxes for days that don't fit. The calendar is tabbed to help you quickly turn to the right month.\nIt also has January 2017, a single page calendar reference which has the dates and days for 2015-2017, a section for future planning, a two page spread for contacts, a 10 page notes section with 5 pages of lines and 5 pages of graph, a single page events calendar, a 2016-2019 holiday list, and a time zone and area code page. For the future planning section you have 1/3 a page a month for all of 2017--a little mini calendar and then lined pages to write appointments or notes down for that month.\n\nThe cover is thicker cover stock. The elastic strip that holds it closed is strongly held to rivets in the back. The pages aren't thick, but of the right thickness.\n\nI have no complaints for the quality, but I might suggest that you order it with other stuff.

We have several dogs and go through a lot of dog food.  We've tried probably every brand you can think of, from low end bargain brand to really high end niche brands.  This stuff isn't cheap by any stretch. In spite of the price (it's not that it's overly expensive, it's just pricey and we have several dogs so go through a ton of dog food), this has become the only brand we'll now buy.\n\nLike I said, we've swapped out brands constantly. With three full time family members and a consistent pack of foster pups, trying to strike a balance between price and what the dogs like is rough.  They say you get what you pay for, but you can pay twice this much for some of the stuff at the vets office and yah, supposedly it's best for your dogs but it's hard to tell.  So over time, we started trying mixing the expensive stuff with the cheaper stuff. We've tried going to all moist food before. We've tried using canned food only (much much too expensive).  All this experimenting caused some problems - after the dogs started getting the canned dog food mixed in with the dry food, they got to be picky eaters. So picky that they would turn their noses up when we didn't mix in canned dog food.  After not giving them canned food mixed with the dry for a few days, they'd get used to it and start eating the dry normally. However we got the first bag from Vines for free.  It just so happened that we ran out of canned dog food two days after this arrived and we gave them the really expensive **** mountain food we had.  They would turn up their noses and only come back when they were really hungry. On day 3 of that, we ran out and just used this.  They immediately scarfed it all down (no exaggeration).  We actually had a small problem with two of them trying to eat the other's food they liked it so much.  We held off buying canned food b/c it seemed this would suffice. And sure enough, they were just as enthusiastic about it each day.  After a week when we ran out, we had yet to reorder the Nutro so moved back to the **** mountain and unless it was mixed with canned food, they had the same 'meh' response to it.  The new bag arrived, we swapped it out and viola', no more picky eaters.\n\nIt's really hard to tell in terms of energy level and the like what effect the food is having but there's no reason to think there's any downside to it. The vet hadn't heard of it when we first asked but the owners of the doggy hotel had and said owners reported similar results.  I won't get into unnecessary detail but in terms of digestion, there aren't any problems that we've encountered we have in the past.\n\nIn the end, it's a little costlier than low end dog food but our dogs absolutely love this stuff. Moreover, it ends up being cheaper b/c we don't need to mix in any canned food or anything else.  They love this stuff so much we jokingly call it puppy crack.  Anecdotal evidence isn't pretty weak and our sample size isn't huge, but 7 of our dogs have shown absolutely consistent love for this stuff.

This one actually IS better quality and I felt like it's well thought out as well.\n\nFirst, the ingredients.  I knocked off a half star because they said \"no grains\" but I felt like that was a little misleading... it still has chickpeas, split peas, alfalfa meal and potatoes in it.  So yes, it doesn't have wheat or corn... but it's still veggies/filler material.  The good news, however, is that lamb and chicken meal are the first two ingredients; so the bulk of what you are getting IS not grains.  And I do think chickpeas are better than corn and soy!  It has a large list of vitamins including Omega 6 and yeast; and also has a few herbs: rosemary, green tea and spearmint.  Overall I think the quality of the ingredients is pretty darn good!\n\nSecondly, the protein is high. REALLY high. Most \"high protein\" dog foods are in the 26% crude protein range; this one is 32%. The fat is a little higher than most too... most are about 14% and this is 18%.  So I do feel like this is much better in terms of a more natural canine diet.\n\nSo how does it pass on the taste test?  Very good!  It has small, uniform little bites... about 1/4\" wide and 1/8\" thick... good for large or small dogs.  And it was gobbled up super quick with no complaints... a definite A+ there.  It smells fine too... yay for that!\n\nAnd one minor added bonus: the bag is resealable. It has a ziploc, sturdy seal to it.  Minor, I know... but it's super nice so that mice and other random animals can't easily get back into it even if they happen to get into my storage area.  And even if my dog did, the plastic bag is pretty darn sturdy and thick, so I am not sure if he would be able to really get into it.\n\nNow another reason I took off a half star is because of the price. It's ridiculously expensive.  I can buy a 50 pound bag of junky dog food for 4 pounds of this.  I felt like it was quite overblown in price.

I hope this helps someone.  Iams owned the Eukanuba brand before both the Iams and Eukanuba brands were sold to P&G, and then P&G sold both the Iams and Eukanuba brands to Mars in 2014.  It seems that Mars has decided to just go with the Iams brand name for their cat foods, although the Eukanuba dog foods appear to still be available.  The cat foods are no longer listed on the Eukanuba website.  Since the same manufacturer owns both brands, hopefully the Iams brand will be just as good.\n\nOriginal review:  I ordered a bag of Eukanuba Adult Cat Chicken Formula from Amazon. I used to feed the Eukanuba chicken formula and the Eukanuba lamb formula a few years ago with great results, but my local pet supply store quit carrying it. After I could no longer find Eukanuba, I switched to Iams Premium Protection for a while, but the local pet supply store stopped carrying that except in the small, expensive by weight bags, so then I switched to the Science Diet Mature Indoor formula after carefully checking the ingredients list. After Science Diet changed their formula to include cheap and nasty wheat gluten which is nothing except a cheap filler that adds no value whatsoever to the food, I am so glad I ordered the Eukanuba cat food. On Eukanuba once again after a few years, my cats' coats have become incredibly, noticeably silkier than on the other foods. My cat that is sensitive to wheat no longer has watery eyes and dirt stuck to the inner corners of her eyes due to the watering caused by wheat sensitivity, and her stools are not loose at all. Amazon has the Eukanuba chicken formula at a great price right now, and with free shipping, the price can't be beat.

You know the drill: you have to trick your cat into entering the tiniest room in the home, containing both you and the dreaded carrier.  Closing the door triggers a biochemical reaction deep in your fluffy sweetheart's brain and next thing you know, a terrifying physical transformation has taken place and you're trying to corral a puffed up ball of volcanic anger and tiny whirling knives into the soft-sided rectangular prison of hellcat's worst nightmares.  If you survive this heroic endeavor, you face another challenge: how to prevent imminent escape.  Keeping the carrier in one piece is an equally important goal, of course.  Hellcats laugh in the face of most soft-sided carriers: their flimsy mesh disintegrates at a steely glance, thin nylon or canvas sides melt like butter beneath razor claws, and weak zippers part like the Red Sea if hellcat even thinks of making a break for it.  But hellcat has met her match in the Sherpa Ultimate Bag!  The only devastation my hellcat has managed to wreak on her Sherpa is in the form of a shredded fleecy mat.  This hellcat owner recommends replacing it with something more substantial, or tossing a blanket over it.\n\nYou could use a plastic carrier as transport, and I'm sure someone out there reading this is wondering that exact thing, but hellcats take even less kindly to carriers with barred doors that invite inquisitive dogs at the vet's office to inspect their mobile prison.  Hellcat wants to travel as inconspicuously as possible, and the multiple flaps act as iron curtains between their burning resentment and the world at large.  Strips of industrial-strength mesh near the top of the carrier let in plenty of oxygen, keeping hellcat's mind sharp and fresh...as sharp as the claws that will soon be shredding your tender flesh, and fresh as the blood that will soon be pouring from your wounds.\n\nSo, in other words, I highly recommend it!  I'd give it a solid 5 stars if the fleece mat was thicker and more hellcat-proof.\n\nIf hellcat has to stay in her carrier unsupervised for any length of time, I use twist ties to secure the zippers - just in case.  I've seen her do her worst to the carrier to no avail, but I don't like to take chances.  You can turn your back on hellcat, but then you'll always wonder what evil may be lurking in the shadows...\n\nOh, by the way, once hellcat has resumed her normal sweetie pie form, she will seek out her Sherpa for naps!!

They throw it and run with it through the house as it says \"Ooohh Nooo!\" - It's sturdy enough for my boys who weigh 15 and 25 pounds.\n  If your dog likes vocal toys this is great- it's not too loud and the body is soft enough that it doesn't break anything if it gets whipped a lil wildly while they play with it.

Samson has dozens of toys and he likes to pic a toy for the day.  Lamb chop is that toy 50% of that time, until, I had to take it away to the hospital for surgery(meaning, I have to sew it up).  I gave Samson this for 2015 Christmas and he loved his lamb chop instantaneously.  The reason for the 2 star rating?  It's for the type of material used for lamb chops face and front feet.  It's made out of a knit, sock like material that tore very easily.  Samson does t tear up his toys anymore.  Though he does play rough with them.  He had lambchop less than 2 weeks when I noticed the first holes in the knit material on one foot, soon holes in the knit material on its face followed, soon after that, the other foot developed holes.  In less than a month the holes in his face knit material had multiplied to point stuffing fell out. That's when I took lambchop away.  Oh, after first hole in lambchops face, Samson found where the insidesqueaker was and was working towards it, so I reached in and removed squeakers.  I'm sad that they used such a stupid material for its face and front legs.  Usually when a seam copes undone, (which is usuall the case when his babies need to go to hospital), I just get out some upholstery thread and a needle and sew it shut.  The way this knit material is, I'm at a loss as how to repair his toy.  This toy would make an awesome baby toy minus the squeaker but a lousy puppy toy or any dog that has teeth and actually plays with his toys.  Obviously whoever designed toy with this knit  material hasn't a clue about how dogs play with their toys.  I wouldn't recommend this toy to any dog owner due to the knit material tears so easily, even with normal play. I found another lamb toy that Samson just loves, it's one of kong' s lambs.  After a couple of months, the face seam did come apart but was easily repairable.  This toy is too difficult to figure how to repair.  Usually when I repair a toy, it does t come apart again where I repair it.  This toy though, I know that knit material will keep tearing.

I think it's for smaller dogs though, big ones would tear this up very easy. I am sure my little one will with a little time, but as long as he enjoys himself, and there is no chance of him getting hurt, I don't mind. Just have to watch for when they get to the squeaker's so they  don't choke on them. But we have to keep an eye on our dog / dogs always anyways.

When I was in the process of adopting my dog, I went dog toy crazy, but kept all toys in the 4-8$ range. This, by far, was the best value. I ordered another squeaky toy that was the same price and it was a third the size and the squeaker was much harder to get to. What I love about this is that it is fluffy and has easy to get to squeakers in all four legs and the stomach. The toy is soft so sometimes my dog just likes cuddling with this toy too.\n\nAll the other toys I've purchased are easy for me to squeak, but my dog has had difficulty getting to them when she wants to, which kinda ruins some of the fun for her. This toy is definitely her favorite and I love how easily she can hold this in her mouth and also squeak it. She has ripped the squeakers out of her other toys, but has not been able to with this one (even though she's played with this toy more). It is very well made and an ESSENTIAL for us!\n\n My childhood dog also had this toy and loved it too, so I think it is great overall [my childhood dog and current dog both are between 15-20 pounds].

One of my dogs, Prue, has seriously made me question whether all dogs go to heaven or some dogs have a special place they get to go instead.  I still love Prue, however, and, once a year, I buy her a special gift.  Every year, Prue gets a new \"Toy Toy.\" Toy Toy is a stuffed lambchop toy that the dog adores.  The dog can jump up and bite my nose repeatedly most mornings (I wish I were joking) but she has a special fondness for this 10\" super plush stuffed lamb that I cannot figure out.  She carries it around.  She squeaks it's middle and it's paws.  She cuddles it's soft plush head.  She is very protective of it and won't let the other dogs de-stuff or de-fuzz or de-squeak it.  This goes on for months.  She carries the toy, which is almost bigger than her, in her mouth until, inevitably, she turns her back for too long and our meaty 18 pound de-squeaking monster of a dachsund grabs the toy and runs to a place where Prue can't get to Toy Toy.  For weeks after, Prue will carry around the empty carcass of Toy Toy until she brings it outdoors and it can't come back inside because it is dirty.\n\nAnd then she waits until I buy her another one.  She just got her new one and when I hid it behind my back and squeaked the squeaker I am not exaggerating when I say this teeny tiny chihuahua jumped 3 feet in the air over and over again.  When I gave her 2016 Toy Toy she grinned and has not let it out of her sight.  When she is happy to see us she bites into Toy Toy and squeaks it at us.\n\nI have no idea what I will do if they discontinue this toy.  It is the only thing that makes this dog behave and I am pretty sure that Prue's special place is one that doesn't have Toy Toy in it.  This is a great soft squeaky toy of excellent quality.

Not all 3 of course. But at least one! I have two spare lambies in my cabinet for when these go down and will buy more one those stop working. There's been no other toys that have lived up to the way these lambies have!\n\nI have two down at all times and they get thrown around 30 to 40 feet every day up to 40 times each day in play. They often get picked up in the jaws of a male boxer and whipped from side to side before bringing it back to me to throw again. When they get dirty, I pop them into my washer but I do not dry them. Each lambie has been washed at least 7 times each already and still looking great!\n\nMy boxers will often lay on them as well. They have not torn apart like many of the other plush toys they have. Both my boxers have soft mouths and are great with plush toys but most toys sewing comes apart easily with their big teeth and I have a list of brand I won't buy from if they fall apart within a week. If your dog destroys most toys, a plush isn't worth giving to them anyway. If your dog doesn't like squeakers get the bigger version of these. I own them as well and wrote my review for them too. Love them as well!\nGreat toy and I will buy again!", "summary": "Oh the lambies! they are wondeful!!", "unixReviewTime": 1403654400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2014", "reviewerID": "A3ICSSBOT1IRAT", "asin": "B000062WUT", "style": {"Pattern:": " Sock Monkey"}, "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "reviewText": "Got this as a 'present' for my roommate's dog because her old toy was destroyed.

He learned quickly and no longer destroys every toy when it arrives! (If you do this, do yourself a favor and use the regular unflavored dental floss.

I removed the batting from the rest of the body and placed Mr.s Bill's head with the soundmaker inside into a long men's sock (think sock monkey). I placed more batting around Mr. Bill's head to give soundmaker more cushioning.  Suggestion: it may be a good idea to use packing tape on the outside of the soundmaker itself to keep it intact (just in case you have dog that likes to chew). One sock is not enough cushion surrounding Mr. Bill's head though because holes can be made easily into just one sock layer and the jaw pressure from a dog's mouth could break the plastic on the soundmaker. Because of this, I suggest 2-3 socks (short or long on the inside) with the outermost sock long because then you can tie 2-3 knots at the end.  What you have is a long body that you can draw some eyes on with permanent marker on one end of the body and the knots at the other end will be like a rope toy.\n\nPros from this design:\n-dog can play with either end of the toy.\n-person can throw toy (without much drool) with the knotted end easily.\n-more stuffing= more protection for the soundmaker you wanted to reuse.\n-it's easier to notice when the toy is being destroyed- then you just rewrap in another sock!\n\nToy Diagram (Size approximate):\n[--10 inches long---] & 2-3 inches wide\n/~~~~~~~~~\\\n|~O~~~~~~~|\n|~O~~~~~~~|--^-^-^--\\\n|~~~~~~~~~|--~-~-~--/\n\\~~~~~~~~~/", "summary": "Soundmaker lasts a long time if you remake it into another toy.", "unixReviewTime": 1296259200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2011", "reviewerID": "A2F7YOC0OEZFPG", "asin": "B000062WUT", "style": {"Pattern:": " Sock Monkey"}, "reviewerName": "SuzanneC", "reviewText": "My dog loves his Sock Monkey, plays with it every day.

Normally the toys that he loves fall apart within a few days.  It's amazing how long this one has lasted!  The fact that I can change the squeaker out once he kills the first one is awesome. these are the best plushie toys ever.  They are the perfect size and for my weenie dog, and he loves the texture.  He plays with it and snuggles it instead of trying to destroy it.  By playing tug of war, I have found that it is very durable, and does not rip easily, although after about a year one of the legs came off.  There was no fuzzy stuffing for him to pull out and leave all over the house, so that's a bonus for me, and the fir doesn't easily come off, so this toy is essentially mess-less.
