Within 2 days of MAYBE 5 minutes per day of me explaining how the clock worked, he could tell time to the exact MINUTE and get it perfectly right every time!\n\nMy boy is CRAZY about gears and the fact that this clock has two internal gears showing through a clear window grabbed his eyes and riveted his attention the second he saw it. He immediately wrestled the clock from my hands to play with it. Since playing is learning, I let him have it. The hands are cleverly geared to where the hour hand will advance when the minute hand is turned but the hands are not \"locked\" so you can move the minute and hour hand to wherever you want them to be. This is VERY helpful when you are first teaching time. I could place the hour hand EXACTLY on 12 and the minute hand EXACTLY on the 6 to help him identify 12:30. With other clocks the hour & minute hands lock so when the minute hand is on the half hour, the hour hand is between the 12 and 1 and it won't let you move it forwards or back. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that this clock does not lock like that and lets me move the hands completely independently or in tandem as I choose! Sure, he can see that when he moves the minute hand, the hour progresses on its own towards the next hour number and NOW he understands how to read a clock when the hour hand is halfway between two numbers but before he was confused by the hand being between the 12 and 1 and would guess at the time (sixty o'five?)\n\nAnother thing I love about this clock is that around the outside edge of the numbers is a blue painted \"gear\" circle shape (shown as a green outer ring in the preview) that has the five minute increments written beside every number and the \"teeth\" of the gear mark the individual minutes in between each 5 minute number. He latched on to the gear concept instantly so explaining to him that each gear tooth represented one minute made learning to tell time a SNAP. Literally, I explained the very basics and as he played with the clock, he got it. Easiest thing I have EVER taught him thanks to this little Judy clock!\n\nIf you feel like maybe you can't put your understanding of telling time into words, don't worry! The little booklet that comes with the clock gives you step-by-step teaching sentences you can repeat to your child and even covers what 'quarter hour' means. The booklet is about 5x7 inches with some small coloring pages, a few short question worksheets and time telling challenges, etc. I started to use the booklet and got to the part about where I explain quarter hours (the clock is like a pizza and you can slice the time into 4 equal parts of 15 minutes each) and my son was hushing me up because he suddenly understood telling time and wanted to make the clock read the same time as our digital microwave clock. This was in the first five minutes of the thing being in his hands and he did it!\n\nIf you have a child who is a tactile-kinesthetic learner, has had difficulty telling time or you just want to make homework a million times easier, get this clock! (And I suggest this style - 'My Own Little Judy Clock' that has non-locking hands). Confusing homework sheets with bland black-and-white clock images become soooo much easier to understand when your child can hold a clock, move the hands around, count by fives along the outer minute rim or count the individual teeth if necessary to answer math questions. If only all of teaching was this easy!\n\nClock is yellow plastic with plastic hands and internal gears. It isn't flimsy but could crack if stepped on. Hands are not brittle and have some give to them, which is nice because they get much more handling. 5 inches tall by 5 inches wide with little plastic easel stand in the back for upright display. Black printed numbers with a blue printed outer minute ring.

It is about the dimensions of a full sized book and the black handle which houses the battery/light source is somewhat bulky.  A small button toggles the light intensity from low to dim to off.\n\nUSE\n\nPlace the item on the page that you want to read, push the button to the light intensity that you desire (allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness, which may take a minute or more), and flip the item to the other page to read.  As you turn the page, you will need to take the item out, and place it back into the book.\n\nIn concept, this product is ideal.  You have a light source that is limited to the pages that you are viewing.  However, even on the highest intensity (let's call it dim and dimmer), the light is still somewhat low.  What can you read with this item?  Books that have high contrast paper (glossy pages are most ideal since the reflective proper of the paper allows for better view).  Conventional novels are a bit more difficult to read.  Magazines are impossible unless you read on your stomach with the magazine placed on the bed.  Furthermore, pictures are difficult to see, at best.\n\nDURABILITY\n\nLike any screen on a laptop, I placed a SCREEN PROTECTOR on my lightwedge to prevent scratches.  Any scratch with transmit uneven light (more than usual).\n\nGiven that LEDs have very little power requirements, I have had the same batteries in the unit for the past 3 years, and it is still running.\n\nDESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nMore LED bulbs along the 'spine' of the handle would improve the light intensity.\n\nA thinner, scratch resistant plastic with a lighter handle would be a marked improvement.\n\nVERDICT\n\nKnowing the limitations and tendency for scratches, it is an innovative product that still has good uses.

Though there is a section which covers making cake pop dough and different sizes of round pops, this book doesn't cover different flavors, different shapes (except pushing the dough through a tube) and decorating elements like candy, sprinkles, pretzels, etc. are not covered much at all. What is covered are cookie pops and brownie pops molded in Wilton molds, dipping pops into candy melted in a Wilton candy pro melting pot (microwaving not covered), pops dried in Wilton pop decorating stand (styrofoam not mentioned) and decorating using primarily Wilton candy sprinkles of all kinds and a lot of Wilton pre-rolled and tinted fondant.  Almost all the pops are round or molded in a Wilton mold. They also neglect to mention using a cookie scoop, a great way to get your cake pops all the same size.\n\nDon't get me wrong, many of the pops are gorgeous and I will definitely be using some of the techniques, even the ones using fondant, but it is unlikely a beginner will be able to make these pops the first time.  Instead, buy Bakerella's book, which isn't perfect, but is better for beginners and has photos of the decorating elements, makes different shaped pops, talks about candy temperature and cake pop temperature.

I think I like my five favorite songs from The Eminem Show better than my five favorite from MMLP, but I think MMLP is better top to bottom.  There are a few songs on The Eminem Show (Drips, Solider, Cleanin' Out My Closet, Saying Goodbye to Hollywood) that are entirely skippable, and you just don't have that on the MMLP.\n\nI would highlight the Sing for the Moment track as a standout as I believe it is the first time that Em used a classic rock track as the foundation of a song, an awesome trend he would continue in the future.

The Eminem Show is a culmination of this Detroit-raised hip-hop lyricist angst met with an incredible production element that gives every song huge legs.  It's not just about the rhymes Em is spitting on each track, it's about the hook in the music.  The Marhsal Mathers LP might be looked at as his biggest turning step forward as a rapper, but as an artist with enormous reach The Eminem Show is perhaps the most classic album he's ever put forth.

Listened to it in my truck on an hour drive (which wasn't long enough to listen in one sitting). I listen to all kinds of music...opera, rock, country. I don't dislike rap but I don't listen to it very much. Got this from the library and thought I would give it a try. I can understand why he is liked so much. Great beat...could hardly stop bobbing my head. I listened to it while driving...windows down...bass beating. Felt like a gangsta! The lyrics can certainly offend many people but I took it as a history lesson of what young people are up too. I think the guy is a genius. The amazing speed that he can spit out sentences is astounding. Really forces you to focus on what he is saying. Every song on this CD is different but they all have the entrancing beat. The song, \"Cleaning out my Closet\" is really touching and sad. Sure this is all explicit. But banning his music is like burning Beatle records or not allowing Elvis to move his hips on TV. Every generation has somebody that they try to stop from getting messages to the young folk. It is his story and he is telling it his way. I've met people who think they shouldn't cuss on war shows...that they don't need it. It is because of that, that people think war is gallant and heroic (which sometimes it can be). Instead they need to be showing people screaming, cussing when their leg is blown off - that is real. Why would you want to edit it? Eminem is telling his story his way. It is his emotions pouring out in his song. If you don't like it then don't buy it. Don't ban it. This is a really good album. I just listened to it again yesterday whilst walking. I was able to really concentrate on the lyrics. Give it a chance older folks! To me this is every bit as classic \"album\" as Dark Side of the Moon, Days of Future Passed and Take Five.

From thought provoking yet playful lyrics to slick beats that lace his determined delivery, this album has rarely a dull moment.  Sure, it contains one of his single worst songs (`Drips'), but it also contains a slew of his best.\n\nThe album opens with a string of strength, starting with `White America'.  The song is targeted at, but not limited to, the political embarrassments that surrounded our country around the time the album was dropped.  With a fiery delivery that shows true passion for his themes, Eminem defies the stigma that surrounds the genre and shows that he has logical teeth behind his words (he's shown that before, but it's always nice to be reminded).  `Business' follows with a funky beat that gives Eminem a nice backdrop for his clownish lyrics.  It's not the best track on the album, and it's certainly not the best of Eminem's playful tracks, but it kind of gets everything right.  `Cleanin' Out My Closet' brings us back to a more serious place, delivering one of Eminem's best tracks to date.  Eminem takes us back to his childhood and uncovers more about his turbulent relationship with his mother.  The picture he paints is grim, yet it is lathered with pure style.  `Square Dance' jumps back to a more playful tone (yet it certainly retains a more serious edge with its lyrical content) and it does so flawlessly.  This one has always been one of my favorites on the album.  The beat is sick and the rhymes are tightly structured around the infectious beat.\n\nAnd then you have `Soldier', which is like one of the best rap songs of the decade.  The track is perfect, containing one of the best beats on the album and the way Eminem struts his swagger, slinging verbal assaults like it was dirt in your eye; it just all screams authentic angst which helps sell this as one of the more poignant tracks on the album.  The anger here is perfectly situated to elevate the track into something so dark it feels raw and real.  Unlike the times when Eminem tries to make his murderistic (yes I made that word up for this review) rampages seem playful or humorous, Eminem shrugs humor to the side and delivers something unlike him yet completely comfortable.\n\nHe's far more than just a one-trick pony.\n\nReminiscent of his previous releases, there is that one track that became his first single and gathered him boatloads of attention once again; this time it was `Without Me'.  The track is hilarious and fun and certainly in line with `The Real Slim Shady' and `My Name Is'.  I actually prefer `Superman', which is a hilarious parody of all those ridiculously perverse love songs that circulate the airwaves.\n\nThe later half of the album contains a few tracks that really deserve to be singled out.  `Sing for the Moment' is one of Eminem's better tracks to use samples.  The Aerosmith sampling is perfectly suited for the song and it elevates Eminem's message.  `When the Music Stops' is insanely fierce from start to finish.  `Till I Collapse' is also very strong, and Nate Dogg's chorus lines give the song an almost vintage feel.  I love his voice and the way he lends a touch of class to every track he inhabits.  `My Dad's Gone Crazy' is a great way to close out the album.  Having Hallie on the track seems a tad odd, especially when you consider the things he says in this song, but it's a playful song that is slathered with humor, so don't take this track too seriously.\n\nIt's just fun.\n\n`Say Goodbye to Hollywood' and `Hallie's Song' have their moments, but they don't quite get it completely.  Still, they are nice additions and don't feel like filler here.  In fact, the only track I didn't really care for (outside of the abomination that was `Drips') was `Say What U Say', Eminem's collaboration with Dr. Dre.  It just lacks the real spark that comes from Shady's music.  It felt like a rejected Dre track, not a refurbished Eminem track.\n\nAlas, the album as a whole is close to genius.  He proves here that despite his vulgar use of words deemed inappropriate, he cannot be defined by his controversial take on life.  By toning himself down here, Eminem shows us that there is a great deal of talent behind those offensive slurs, developing an album reflective of where he was in his rise to fame.  I love that he is back in the game, and I can't wait to see where he goes now.  If he can top this album then we'll be looking at one of the greatest rappers to ever set foot in the game, but then again, I think he's already achieved that title.", "summary": "The last great Eminem album...", "unixReviewTime": 1281916800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2008", "reviewerID": "A10C5CJK1YKGV0", "asin": "5509356839", "style": {"Format:": " Audio CD"}, "reviewerName": "Steffan Piper", "reviewText": "\"Things done changed ...\" -- Notorious B.I.G.\n\nSome folks might be wondering what's going on with Marshall/Slim at the moment. His absence on the music scene, despite how you might feel about him, is noticeable. His music is singular, even in such a prolific field as Rap is and even with as many people that are on his CD, whether as a performer, a producer or a mixer. Historically, the people that have walked in his shoes never faired very well, whether it was through continued success or respect amongst fans or becoming a sell-out. I don't think Slim has to worry about the last one at all as he's struggled continuously to stay relevant and fresh.\n\nThe Eminem show may not be the fan favourite, and it may even have a few low moments that fans would rather do without, but this album is like a snapshot of the artists life in full-color, or stereo. It's a very complex and sometimes moving memoir on his life in song. A lot of other recording artists would be so lucky to have been able to achieve something this powerful so early in their career. In fact, unfortunately, most musicians never do. Good 'concept albums' are few and far between.\n\nThe story of a young man trying to get up out of the hood, is one that's familiar with a lot of people. The struggle is real and that's probably why his music has resonated with so many folks from all corners of the world.\n\nRap music may have gone through an epiphanous phase during the mid nineties through to ot-five. Slim coming in during the beginning and making it all the way through to the end without plastic surgery, heavy jail time or an over-dose. He may have made it through some dark times in order to tell us about it all years from now.\n\nThis is an album that absolutely must be listened to as it encapsulates the last decade very well.\n\n... ...", "summary": "It's hard being young, from the slums, eatin' five cent gums, not knowing where your next meal is coming from ...", "unixReviewTime": 1225065600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2005", "reviewerID": "A3BUB7OJ2484KR", "asin": "5509356839", "style": {"Format:": " Audio CD"}, "reviewerName": "Maximilian Kohler", "reviewText": "Just buy the album, cause even if you don't like it (if you don't then there's definitely something wrong with you) Emimen is going to be a legend someday and anything that has anything to do with him is going to be worth millions of dollars.", "summary": "This album isin't rap...it's Eminem!", "unixReviewTime": 1105660800}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "5", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2004", "reviewerID": "A1IL6W1NK05UW9", "asin": "5509356839", "style": {"Format:": " Audio CD"}, "reviewerName": "C.

The songs are very personal, and my favorites are: White America, Square Dance, Without Me and Hailie's Song.\n\nEminem has had a tough life. So have a lot of people. But what makes him inspirational is that instead of wallowing in victimhood, he worked hard, he didn't give up and he found his voice. I admire this artist for channeling his anger into something creative. Furthermore, even as he criticizes his mother, he says \"I'm sorry, mama, I never meant to hurt you\" -- this to a woman who was too busy fighting her own demons to be a mother to her talented and intelligent son. (Couldn't she PLEASE just tell him that she screwed up and she's sorry?) Another emotion that comes through, over and over, is his love for his daughter. What's not admirable about that? Also, I don't see half-naked women writhing in Eminem videos. I see intelligence and humor, and this is what I really love about Marshall Mathers. He is very very funny, and more power to him for taking his pain and his anger and creating humor and art. It's easy to perpetuate wickedness, tough to end the cycle of bad parenting and violence, but he seems to be trying.\n\nWhile I can't speak for all librarians, as a group we're against censorship, and I believe that you should never let anyone tell you what to think about music -- or literature or politics or how to run your life, for that matter.

Slim Shady's third album, \"The Eminem Show\" proves once and for all that Mr. Mathers is extremely talented, in addition to being a lightning rod for controversy.  With his debut album in 1999, \"The Slim Shady LP\", it would easy to have written him off as another white rapper being a pretender to the throne of hip-hop greatness.  Even with catchy songs like \"My Name is\" and \"Guilty Conscience\" making loud noise on the Top-40 charts, critics were in a hurry to lump him with other 'Great White Hopes' that flamed out like Vanilla Ice (just a complete joke) and Snow (just never found an audience).  The success of his sophomore album, \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" shocked many and showed he had staying power, but the truth is, Eminem was destined for success from the start.\n\n  First, Eminem is a gifted lyricist and free-stylist, which already separates him from the pre-fabricated hip-hop garbage like Ja Rule and such.  Second, he made the crucial decision early on to ally himself with arguably the most respected and skillful name in the hip-hop world, Dr. Dre.  With Dre's expert and ORIGINAL sound backing up Shady's vocals, it was inevitable that he would be successful and that eventually people would come around to realize his talent.\n\n  \"The Eminem Show\" continues to show the evolution of that talent.  \"Without Me\" captures the same fast-paced, light-hearted slams at popular culture that \"The Real Slim Shady\" did on his previous album.  In addition to such 'amusing' songs like that and \"White America\", Eminem delves deeper into, and makes some peace with, his sordid past.  \"Cleaning Out My Closet\" goes right to the heart of his pain about his upbringing and his fractured relationship with his mother.  If his lyrics in this song are indeed and accurate depiction of his life growing up, then it's no wonder he's such an angry individual.  Yet, through that anger, he seems to be making peace with himself, even if it means terminating any relationship with his mother.  It's gritty, harsh, but real material.\n\n  Eminem is branching out into movies now with a loosely autobiographical \"8 Mile\".  Early reviews there seem positive, too.  It's always fascinating to see what he will produce next.  The controversy he generates grabs people's attention the first time.

Eminem blasts several people, from President Bush, to Moby. Even Elvis doesn't go unnoticed. ofcourse, that's the fun of having a new Eminem Cd, is to see who, and how many people get slammed. He delves into his relationship with his mom, ouch, and Kim, and his daughter, and Dr. Dre. One of the highlights of the album is a song called Square Dance. It's a very poignant view point of America, and of Eminem's feelings\nabout his own life. Of course, the all the songs have his rhymes, and his rapping.

At first, I was very disappointed in how poorly of a fit the lid and container were. But I decided to try them anyway, and proceeded to sanitize them properly.\n\nBeing a chef for six years has taught me many things. One of which, you should always boil new plastic containers for at least a minute (best at 5 minutes) to remove any contaminants from manufacturing. We get enough plastics and other chemicals in our diets already. And if you are buying for your kid's lunches like I did, you should do this purely for your family's sake.\n\nThe trick to plastic containers with fitted lids is that after you boil them in plain tap water for at least one minute:\n1. Remove from boiling water using a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon.\n2. Tip the container/lid so most of the water drains back into the pot.\n3. Immediately find it's matching container/lid from the pot, and after draining it as well, put the two pieces together.\n4. Allow to cool.\n5. The lid and container should now be a much better fit. They might still be snug, but should be much easier on your fingers.\n\nDon't take my word for it though. Please only try one at first to make sure it works as well for you as it does for me.\n\nI hope this helps everyone purchasing this product.", "summary": "Lid too tight problem is fixable!", "unixReviewTime": 1294358400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2011", "reviewerID": "A2LSFXEBY7OEUR", "asin": "710105482X", "reviewerName": "Lauren S.", "reviewText": "I love hummus but too much of a good thing can be bad, with that in mind I bought these.

My plan was to carry them back and forth between work and home (on public transportation) so I needed something that would be small, light, and unbreakable.  I had tried the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Tupperware-Midget-Salt-Pepper-Shaker-NEW-Rare-Purple/dp/B008C4QVDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tupperware Midget Salt & Pepper Shaker NEW Rare Purple</a>, but found that the 2-ounce size of the container was too big, and that it took up too much room at the office and in my tote bag.  This smaller, 1-ounce size was much better for meeting my needs.\n\nLuckily, Tupperware makes their products so that the same size lids will sometimes work on similar containers, depending on the size of the lip of the container.  These two products looked like the lids would be interchangeable, so I took a chance and placed the order.  I'm happy to report the shaker part of the original set I bought fits perfectly onto this container.  By the way, the salt and pepper lids work on this set, too:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Tupperware-Smidget-Container-1oz-Each-Assorted-Set-5/dp/B001E3DMXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tupperware Smidget Container 1oz Each Assorted Set 5</a>&nbsp;I have been hunting for a good set of portable salt and pepper shakers for years. By combining these two products, the mission was accomplished!  Note - I plan to re-post this review, with minor variations, on these two other product pages, so if you see it over there, you won't need to re-read the details.\n\nAny Tupperware container with a round lid is leak proof, so you can fill them up with small quantities of shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash, toothpaste, etc., and take them on the road, without worrying about leaks.  I have NEVER had a problem with a leak from a Tupperware container with a round lip.  As an added bonus, the containers have a lot of uses.  You can use them to keep your spices fresh.  My mom used to use them to store Wilton icing coloring dyes. They would be good for small quantities of craft products.  They are perfect for maintaining order over the small things that get thrown into a junk drawer.  These things are handy, so this list could go on and on.\n\nFrom my experience with Tupperware, sometimes the lids are a bit tight-fitting when they are new.  If you soak the lid in hot water for a couple of minutes, it will expand slightly, and will easily fit onto the container.  You should only need to do this one or two times; after that, they should fit without pre-soaking.\n\nColor - 2 stars\n\nThe color is ugly, and I would not call it pink.  It is more of a watered-down version of a coral-like (or maybe salmon-like) tint than pink.  When I saw the color on the computer screen, I thought the color difference between my idea of pink and the reality would be chalked up to the virtual world.  But the reality was worse than the monitor.  :p  Saying this color is \"pink\" isn't even as accurate as saying that \"aquamarine\" is \"green\" or \"blue.\"  I'm glad I didn't plan to keep these out on the table.\n\nValue Analysis - 3 stars\n\nIn the past, it was always been worth paying a little extra for Tupperware because of the superior quality of the Tupperware brand, as well as the lifetime guarantee.  With this order, however, I noticed that the plastic feels slightly thinner and more brittle than the Tupperware containers I bought 20 years ago.  I actually took some of the older containers out and did a side-by-side comparison, and I liked the older ones better.  I'm afraid the containers may not be as durable as they used to be, but they still seem to be very durable.  Tupperware is still superior to most plastics, but the quality of Rubbermaid has improved over the years, and Rubbermaid is much less expensive.  If my Rubbermaid fails, I just throw it out and buy a new one.\n\nWhen I have used the warranty, it has provided a needed replacement for a favorite piece of plastic, and I've been very pleased with the results.  Balance this against the fact that, if I want to return a Tupperware product that fails, I have to pay shipping to send it back to them.  This is often just as expensive as the cost of the item being replaced.  I also have to pay shipping and handling for them to send the replacement back to me.  According to their web site, this is currently (May 2013) a flat rate of $5.75.  (And this assumes that the item can still be replaced, and you don't end up with a substitute.  You may wind up with a replacement of a different color, so the set you have no longer matches.)  I have a few pieces of Tupperware that need to be replaced, but have decided it's just not economical to do so.  So the pieces sit there in the back of the closet while I wait for the pile to grow large enough to make it worth the cost of sending them in and getting them replaced.  I have tried to convince myself to just throw them out, but they don't take up much room. ;)\n\nIs Tupperware worth the extra cost?  Yes, but only for especially useful and/or unique pieces.

At first, I was very disappointed in how poorly of a fit the lid and container were. But I decided to try them anyway, and proceeded to sanitize them properly.\n\nBeing a chef for six years has taught me many things. One of which, you should always boil new plastic containers for at least a minute (best at 5 minutes) to remove any contaminants from manufacturing. We get enough plastics and other chemicals in our diets already. And if you are buying for your kid's lunches like I did, you should do this purely for your family's sake.\n\nThe trick to plastic containers with fitted lids is that after you boil them in plain tap water for at least one minute:\n1. Remove from boiling water using a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon.\n2. Tip the container/lid so most of the water drains back into the pot.\n3.

This is the second of this exact model of paper towel holder that I have owned, and I bought this as a replacement for the first one. I had the first one for about eight years, and it finally broke, requiring replacement.\nThe thing I like about this specific towel holder is the design (wall or under cabinet mounting is at your option) which allows the roll to be slipped onto the central retaining spindle without requiring support at both ends, making for a secure towel holder that will not allow the roll of towels to fly out of the holder which is common in some holders which retain the towel roll by pressure on opposite ends of the roll. Another nice feature of this holder is the slightly upturned end of the roll retaining bar to prevent the roll from slipping off the rod when towels are aggressively pulled off the roll, especially with one handed operation. Overall this has been a great paper towel holder.\nI gave this holder four stars for one reason only, which is that being exclusively plastic it is vulnerable to fatigue cracking of the mounting cylinder, which requires replacement of the unit.

At first, I was very disappointed in how poorly of a fit the lid and container were. But I decided to try them anyway, and proceeded to sanitize them properly.\n\nBeing a chef for six years has taught me many things. One of which, you should always boil new plastic containers for at least a minute (best at 5 minutes) to remove any contaminants from manufacturing. We get enough plastics and other chemicals in our diets already. And if you are buying for your kid's lunches like I did, you should do this purely for your family's sake.\n\nThe trick to plastic containers with fitted lids is that after you boil them in plain tap water for at least one minute:\n1. Remove from boiling water using a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon.\n2. Tip the container/lid so most of the water drains back into the pot.\n3. Immediately find it's matching container/lid from the pot, and after draining it as well, put the two pieces together.\n4. Allow to cool.\n5. The lid and container should now be a much better fit. They might still be snug, but should be much easier on your fingers.\n\nDon't take my word for it though. Please only try one at first to make sure it works as well for you as it does for me.\n\nI hope this helps everyone purchasing this product.", "summary": "Lid too tight problem is fixable!", "unixReviewTime": 1294358400}, {"overall": 1.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2017", "reviewerID": "A13UQNWMEIUOIO", "asin": "7536693001", "style": {"Color:": " 1st-generation"}, "reviewerName": "Kate", "reviewText": "Not as easy as shown on TV.

S. Slayton", "reviewText": "Look, ignore the negative reviews. It's beautiful and it's cheap. Yeah, you have to do a little work. You have to screw the bases into the wall. They need to be screwed into something secure, not just drywall. There's going to be significant pull on the bases, and you don't want your curtains sagging! Hit a stud- usually about 1/2 inch out from the window edge. Mount the bases, then snap the covers over them. Mount them both first. Then extend the mechanism on the right side as far as it'll go. The instructions show how to do this, but it's easy even if you don't have instructions. There are 3 cylinders on the right side. The left one holds the wire, the right one is attached to the wall, and the center one connects them and tightens the wire once it's attached. The right piece isn't moving. It's screwed to the wall. Use the supplied Allen wrench to loosen the tiny nuts on the left fixture. Insert the wire. Tighten the tiny nuts onto the wire.  Stretch the wire until it'll fit into the right fixture with no slack. Having a friend helps here, but isn't necessary. Loosen the nuts on the right side, insert the wire, and tighten the tiny nuts again. Now hold the left cylinder so it doesn't turn, and turn the middle cylinder to take up the slack!

I used about 9ft of the wire that came with the kit and I have several feet left. The description states that you need to supply your own fasteners/hardware, so unless this addition was just made to the item description, no one can complain about this. I bought some #12 1 1/2\" wood screws so that the heads fit into the pre-countersunk holes in the metal plates that you attach to the walls. One plate and three screws went into a stud and the other into a very smooth masonry wall with some Gorilla Glue. This Gorilla Glue works in *my* case - I must have put about 15 lbs of downward pressure on it and for *me* it was fine, especially since less than 3 pounds will be hanging from it. I hate drilling through masonry walls in a rented house, and so this alternative works fine for me. The fact that the installation instructions are all pictorial was not a problem, the assembly was easy. If you're used to putting things together yourself, this is a simple project. The hardest thing is positiong the wire plates at either wall exactly where you want them if no studs are present. I don't want the wire to sag, so I checked for stud locations *before* ordering this, knowing that I might also have to use masonry anchors and screws. If you can't attach this to wall studs, you might just want to go with ceiling curtain rod brackets ad a very lightweight curtain rod (all of which Ikea happens to have for a lot, lot less than Home Depot).\n\nIf you want to be really cheap, twist two screw eye hooks into the wall studs (I hope they're directly opposite one another) and get some wire. But I do like the simple tension system with this set. The 17mm spacing they indicate you should use is good, especially if you're doing a long room and the wire tends to sag more during installation. With my 9ft room, I only needed about 10mm because my cut wire length was fairly tight to start.

When I tried to bend the fork tines on these at the store they held up way better than any other sets I have compared them too, even the other more expensive sets at Ikea! Also, I believe them to be quite durable because the cafeteria at our local Ikea actually uses the Dragon set as their flatware so you can pretty easily see how they hold up to ware and tare, which seems to be quite well! The new set is pretty shiny but the utensils in the cafeteria seem to have dulled a bit, although I am sure they go through some heavy washing pretty frequently.

I purchased my first Robot-Coupe in, I'm pretty sure, 1983, and have used it and its successors constantly,  I bought my first Mini in probably the mid-1990's, and  I purchased this new Mini because mine died years ago after very heavy duty.

After reading David Lebovitz's blog about minis, I thought \"this is exactly what I'm going to do with my gift certificate!\"  However,  I'm so disappointed in this Mini-Prep.  The first thing I asked it to do was to chop up a Ghirardelli 60% chocolate bar (for brownies, so it didn't have to be perfect)--but it wouldn't even begin to do this even with only half of the bar inside.  So I hauled out the big Cuisinart,  and the chocolate bar instantly turned into chocolate chips.  Next task:  1 ounce of dried shiitake mushrooms which I wanted to turn into a powder for a stew.  Half of the mushrooms turned into a powder.  I dumped those into the stew, returning the chunks to the Mini.  Some powder, but still big chunks.  I pulsed, I tried low and high, I tried continuous, but no luck.  So I broke up the big chunks with my fingers and, eventually, the full ounce of  the mushrooms made its way into the stew.  Third task: almonds.  Similar result:  1/4 of the nuts turned to powder but 3/4 of the nuts remained almost whole almonds.  Again, I broke out the Big Cuisinart and made the chunks go away.  I'm so disappointed:  I was hoping to use the Mini for very small amounts of the kind of things that are hard to keep under control on the cutting board:  Nuts, chocolate, dried stuff.  Not to mention avoiding hand-washing a knife and cutting board as opposed to the easy cleanup with itty-bitty Mini parts on the top shelf of the dishwasher.  I guess I can use this Mini only for things that I could easily crush with my fingers anyway--perhaps Feta cheese?  I should have paid at least $10 more and bought a Mini-Prep with more firepower.

Therefore, I can't review the longevity of this blender at all, and I don't have the benefit of a user guide.  The problems I have, you may not have.\n\nThe lid of this thrift store blender has some orange staining inside which bleach soaking cannot remove.  I would guess it is prone to staining for everyone.  The lid fits snugly yet is easy to remove.  The lid plug is snug yet easy to remove.\n\nThe jar is glass and very sturdy.  The blades inside the jar seem on the small side to me.  However, I have been able to blend smoothies with frozen spinach and raw kale; I can't complain about the performance.\n\nWith other blenders I have known, the bottom of the jar is held into place with a 'jar nut', a band of plastic that screws onto the bottom of the jar.  Unscrew the jar nut, and the gasket and the jar bottom fall out.\n\nThis blender does more or less the same, but the jar nut is huge and is shaped like an inverted ring mould!  The jar goes into\nthe center of the mould; the mould itself fits over the blender base.  (Look at the photos just above the Cuisinsart logo; that horizontal line is the edge of the jar nut.)\n\nI do not like this jar nut.  It comes off easily enough, but it is tricky putting it back together again.  I have taken to putting water in the jar and sitting it in the sink for a couple minutes before using the blender to make sure I have attached it so that the blender jar does not leak.  I am also concerned this plastic jar nut may crack while reassembling the jar.  Dock one star!\n\nThe base is sturdy and easy to clean.  The push buttons are idiosyncratic -- first you turn the blender on with the ON button, THEN you use another button to select the speed you want.  Then you push the OFF button to turn it off.  There is also a separate PULSE button.  The buttons are easy to push and very responsive.\n\nThe last smoothie I made had frozen cranberries, almond milk, walnuts, raw baby carrots, dried mulberries, chocolate protein powder, chopped raw kale.  I put the kale in to see whether the blender could handle it.  The blender ground everything up smoothly except the kale, which was mostly ground up but tiny chunks remained.  If you lined three chunks in a row, they  might be as long as a grain of rice.  I found some cranberry seed too, but not that much.  If I had the patience to let the blender run two or three minutes, those chunks might have  been ground too.  I  am really impressed that the carrots were so pulverized I could not pick them out of my smoothie.\n\nWhen I blend frozen spinach or frozen berries, it leaves no chunks behind.  I do not find it necessary to scrape the sides of the blender (but would probably spend less time blending if I did).\n\nI monitor my blending, but the blender seems solid enough to walk away from while it is running if that is what you want to do.\n\nI have NOT tried to crush ice or make anything other than a smoothie with this blender.  For smoothies, I would say the performance is excellent for a blender in this price range.\n\nI notice some leakage from the bottom blender jar if I let  the blender run awhile (this may be why I found such a good blender at a thrift store).  This leakage occurs even when I check the seal with water as I described before. I would say it is less than a teaspoon BUT it is leaking onto that non-immersible base so I find this an annoyance.  I suspect a design flaw.  My work-around is to pour out my smoothie right away.  I always blend some water after I pour anything out of my blender for ease of cleaning later, and this too must be poured out right away.  Dock another star!\n\nIn summary,  great performer but that jar nut needs rethinking.

At $25 (shipped) a pop, the SPB-456-2 blades aren't cheap but their engineering IS.\n\nThe blender itself has proven to be pretty tough after 5 years of using it 3~5 times a week but their blades simply cannot withstand frozen items.  It worked excellently for the first 3 years of use when it was just milk/yogurt and protein powder but now that I've started freezing bananas and breaking them intop 4/5 pieces and blending them and frozen strawberries in the blender, the blades have been breaking left and right.\n\nThe base of the blade that grabs the spinning rubber \"teeth\" that are on the main drive shaft is made of plastic and threaded onto the main spinning shaft of the blade assembly. Apparently this plastic base screws onto the shaft and if something in the blender catches the teeth just right, it'll strip the plastic base of the blade assembly rendering it useless. The base of the blade assembly will spin freely.\n\nI've got JB weld curing on my latest stripped blade so we'll see if that fixes it but the 5th and final replacement blade is on the way and a new Oster fusion blender (with all metal blade assembly and coupling construction) will be under my Christmas tree in a few weeks. The cuisinart will stick around simply because the food processor still works and the blender itself will be used for backup if needed.\n\nAlso, the hard plastic covering that covers the button area is cracking where the more commonly pressed buttons are located.

I would absolutely buy another (and just did, after nearly 3 years with the first one).  It has worked well from day one.\n\nNow that it died in the way a lot of people describe, I understand what happened and probably what is happening to others.\n\nAll of a sudden, out of the blue, we heard the motor working very hard while mixing up some frozen Pina Coladas.  We tried everything, but it just got worse.  Suddenly, it stopped working at all.\n\nHere is the problem:  It is not the mixer, it is the container.  What changed in 3 years is, we finally replaced our old noisy dishwasher and instead of hand-washing the container as we'd done in the past 3 years, we put it in the new, quiet dishwasher.  THAT RUINED IT.  What happens is, the spinning blade mechanism seizes up.  Maybe there is something in there, a gasket or metal part, that cannot handle the high heat of a dishwasher.  It seizes up to the point where you can't freely spin it.  (Go to the store, check a new one; when you lift the container off, spin the bottom part from underneath, that also spins the blade.  It spins freely.  That's the way it is supposed to operate.)\n\nIf this part seizes, the motor WILL attempt to turn it anyway.  But it struggles, effectively trying to push a locked part, and if you don't catch it in time, it WILL burn out your motor as a result.\n\nWe are now making it a habit to CHECK that the blades freely spin before using it.  AND ALWAYS HAND-WASH THIS CONTAINER.  NEVER USE THE DISHWASHER.\n\nI fully expect this replacement to last another 3+ years.  Other than this issue (which we now understand), it has been bar-quality and always mixed crushed-ice drinks perfectly, provided you don't over-load the amount of ice (which is improper mixing, not the blender's fault; you have to find and remember the ratio of liquid to ice that works; even commercial machines will seize up if you use too much ice).", "summary": " IMPORTANT: Hand wash container or it will seize!", "unixReviewTime": 1245974400}, {"overall": 1.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2009", "reviewerID": "ANLJ5VPEBNP4G", "asin": "B00000JGRQ", "reviewerName": "Neal Wagner", "reviewText": "Read other reviews.

One slight problem I had with this is that that when the blade spins, it tosses everything in an upwards direction, making me having to often stop and try to push the food back down and sometimes I end up with the top of the food still in chunks while the bottom is pretty much disintegrated beyond recognition.

This processor is the one I keep under the kitchen cabinet to be used to make small amounts of sauces,finely chop up garlic,chilies, etc. I have a much larger DLC-5 which I use for larger tasks.\n\nIf someone is purchasing this for the first time I highly recommend sitting down and reading the instruction booklet before proceeding.  I haven't had any problems with the old one because I did that very thing when it first arrived. I even read the new booklet again, just to make sure if they made any changes.\n\nI was most happy to find all these years later, they still manufacture the original unit.

I like to use it for small jobs like chopping herbs, parmesan cheese, and for making pesto.  I haven't had any problems with processing parmesan cheese as one reviewer did.  The blade has two sides, a blunt side for processing hard items like parmesan cheese, chocolate, and coffee beans and a sharp side for processing soft items such as onions, garlic, meats, and mushrooms.  The sharp side is labeled sharp.  If you alternate between processing hard and soft items, you have to remember to check the position of the blade to make sure you are processing with the right side.  In addition, the processor has two speeds, HI & LO.  The LO speed is recommended for use with the sharp side of the blade and pulse action while the HI speed is recommended for use with the blunt side of the blade and continuous processing.  The Mini-Prep has a lot of kick to it for such a small appliance, and I have found it best to hold it steady with one hand, particularly when processing hard food items, because it will jump when powered on.\n\nOne thing I noticed, in the instruction and recipe manual under Operating Techniques, the instructions indicate that hard cheese is processed with a blade and position speed of Blunt/HI but the instructions for grated parmesan cheese in the recipe section uses Sharp/HI.  I pulse at BLUNT/HI and then do continuous hold until its grated like I want it.  For best results, cut the cheese into small pieces as indicated in the instruction manual before processing.\n\nThe Mini-Prep does a fairly decent job of chopping onions and garlic. On occasion I find a stray piece that the blades missed but that's probably because I don't always cut the pieces as recommended.

I can hear you asking, \"So what's the problem?  You send it back for warranty service!\"  Well, to start with, it costs you a pretty penny to ship it back.

But you pay a price both in money and time for all this convenience.\n\nYou can regularly find refurb models online for twenty bucks or so.

Not drying tends to cause the grounds to not transfer properly into the basket.\n\nComplaints:\n\nHonestly, 4 years wasn't enough time for me.

Greenberg", "reviewText": "Review revised on April 24, 2002\nMy initial review:\nMy wife and I have been using this machine for several months now, and we have become familiar with the good, the bad, and the ugly, as these terms relate to this worthwhile but flawed innovation by Cuisinart.\nThe good: the coffee made by the machine is wonderful, IF you have the common sense to adjust the amount of beans you use in accordance with how strong you like your coffee. The people who complain that the coffee is \"weak\" need to put on their proverbial thinking caps and simply ADD MORE BEANS! Yup, once you get the right ratio of beans to water the coffee is plenty strong, and since it's freshly ground, the flavor is terrific. The automatic brewing features are reasonably easy to set and use, and these make it possible to wake up in the morning to freshly brewed coffee, a terrific start to any day. Complaints about how hard it is to clean the machine are also kind of silly; have we gotten so spoiled as a culture that we can't stand to routinely remove and rinse out the necessary parts of a kitchen appliance after every use? Cleaning the removable parts takes a couple of minutes, true, but it's definitely not such an odious task that it should discourage potential purchasers.\nThe bad: the construction of the unit itself needs some improvement; after two months of routine, reasonably careful use, the top of the machine broke off, due mainly to what seems to be a flimsy hinge design. Fortunately, it was still possible to affix the top to the unit during the time we waited for a replacement part.\nThe ugly: possibly the most annoying feature of this machine is that normal cleaning of the unit caused the lettering that labels the various buttons to disappear. We now have memorized the function of each button, but it would have been nice and probably not difficult for the engineers at Cuisinart to design more permanently affixed labels.\nIt's likely that over time, new versions of this machine will be marketed that improve on this one. In the meantime, this is a good, affordable, and reasonably reliable unit that exhibits how clever engineering can help to move us ever closer to that \"perfect home-brewed cup of coffee.\"\nAdded April 24, 2002:\nI feel compelled to inform those few readers who will ever come across this revised review that my initial commentary on this Cuisinart grind and brew unit was overly generous.  No, it wasn't the cleaning process that got to me; I was always willing to accept a little routine maintenance in order to end up with great coffee.  The problem is that this unit simply isn't designed to stand up to everyday use over any extended period of time.  I've already mentioned the disappearing labels for the various buttons.  But after ten months or so of daily use, the machine stopped doing a trustworthy job of sending the ground coffee on to the brewing basket.

The Eastman pump is so easy to use and filters so thoroughly, I can reuse the oil many times over and use my deep fryer more often.  This tool is really an essential item for people who like to deep fry their turkey or chickens outdoors.  It doesn't require a lot of time and it eliminates the messy disposal of oil.

She was making mashed potatoes and busted out something that I had never seen before- A potato ricer.  I was blown away at how creamy the mashed potatoes were and how simple it was.  Because of this is went looking on amazon.  I ended up settling on the Flying colors ricer.  I was able to use it once and here is my review.\nWhen I unpackaged the ricer, I was impressed with the sturdy build of the ricer.  It is a white plastic ( it reminds me of the same plastic that by Bosch mixer utilizes).  The plastic is sturdy but not clunky.  It seems like it will stand the normal pressure usage.  The unit came with 2 ricing screens, a larger on one smaller.  They are both made of stainless steel and look very similar to the meat grinder attachments I have.  For my first use, I made mashed potatoes for a big family gathering and chose the large holed ricing screen.  I was in too big of a hurry to peel the potatoes so I took a gamble with the skins.  As I sort of expected, the wholes got plugged after a few rounds of ricing and I would need to clean the screen off.  But compared to the amount of time it would have taken to peel the 10 lbs. of potatoes, it was a great deal.  The ricer was exactly as I needed and was very impressed with it.

I kept offering to get him one but he couldn't decide on a brand and told me to wait. The opportunity to check this one out came up and I had to take it. This came around 8 o'clock at night and my SO was packing for an upcoming trip. I told him that this came and he dropped everything and went into the kitchen to make mashed potatoes. As a lover of this food, I couldn't complain. He said the insert fit in perfectly and it was really ease to use. He said he didn't have to use much pressure at all to press down and even thought I could do it without aggravating my wrist (which later proved correct). He said it cut down enormously on the time it took to make the potatoes which I noticed too as I thought maybe he'd already done something ahead like cleaned and boiled the potatoes, but he'd done no such thing. The potatoes were delicious with no lumps. He said clean-up was easy as well, that it took less time than ensuring beaters are clean.\n\nHistorically he's made them by either beating, which he doesn't like because they can get over mixed in some spots and still be a bit lumpy in others, or by using a masher, which is slow. He makes mashed potatoes often as he has a few recipes, primarily horseradish, garlic, country and \"normal\". It's always a favorite when we take them to dinner at his parents. And of course, cold the next day is something I like. And he likes to take the day-old  and make some kind of shepherd's pie.\n\nWhen he came back from the trip, one of the first things he did was make another batch of mashed potatoes. I got called in this time to try it out and it was definitely doable even with my super swollen right wrist. He absolutely loves it and is now searching for other mashed potato recipes as well as other ways to use mashed potatoes (like for shepherd's pie) because he's so happy with the results. He's told me to look for other products by this manufacturer, which I will certainly do for presents for him in the future. I did receive this at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest review, but at the current sale price this is an absolute steal. At the regular price, it'd still be worth it given the ease of use and excellent results. This would be an excellent wedding or housewarming gift, and it's made my go-to list for those events.

In addition to making mashed potatoes, this ricer would also be handy for making homemade spaghetti or other noodles. A little bit of the pasta dough could be put inside the ricer and then the noodles could be extruded out of it. This potato ricer would also be good for making baby food as well. I also like using this ricer for squeezing out excess water from spinach or other greens if I am using them in a dish where the excess moisture could be a problem. My potato ricer is white on the outside so it would go well with any kind of kitchen color scheme. I typically keep mine stored in a drawer and do not leave it out, but it would look fine in a tool caddy if it is a kitchen item that is used frequently.

Over time the rubber or nylon eventually wears out and it tears after which they really are no longer good for use in the kitchen (though the handles can be reused for other purposes). This is a nice set of silicone scrapers and so far I am very happy with them. I suspect they will last quite a while longer than the others I have used.\n\nEvery other spatula and scraper I have used, without exception, has a seam that separates the head from the handle. Though not a weak point, it does allow particles to catch and that makes them harder to clean. I even have one scraper that has a removable handle which is convenient for cleaning but has the drawback of the handle coming loose at inopportune times.\n\nThese are all reinforced with a metal rod inside to give them strength and rigidity. So, they do stand up to serious mixing and stirring. A good application in my case is in bread making. Certain breads are better suited to being made by hand with hand tools instead of using a stand mixer. The largest of this set is a shovel-shaped scraper that is perfect for this task and it holds up very well under the load. The end does flex and bend but so far has not shown any signs of fatigue.\n\nThere are three tools in the packages. The largest is, as mentioned above, a larger and heavier scraper that works very well as a mixing spoon. There is a slightly smaller traditional spatula that is perfect for stirring batters and cleaning the bowl afterward. The smallest is just a little smaller than the other two and is suitable for smaller jobs like cake frosting.\n\nAll three of these are seamless and made of food-grade silicone. They hold up well to elevated temperatures  (over 400 degrees Fahrenheit) and do not absorb odors and do not stain. I prefer these to the other scrapers I have in the kitchen and turn to these first (unless they are already being used by someone else in the kitchen).\n\nI cant find much to criticize with these spatulas and scrapers. Theyre made well, they are heavy and reinforced and the three of them complement each other well.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

They're non-stick, non-scratch, and a nice graphite gray color. I don't worry about the kids damaging the cookware when they're using these. Each spatula is reinforced with metal so the handle doesn't bend, yet the head of the spatula retains it's flexibility for getting in the pan like you need it to. They're a one piece design, which I like (another one I loved was two pieces, and it was constantly coming apart).  There's a little hold in the handle so you can hang them up, if you like.

The only difference between these two and your older tried and true models, is that the handles are silicone too and will last. They're sturdy and I've got zero problems using them, just great.\n\nThe pan spatula/flipper is really good too, but I won't be getting rid of my wood models, and you probably realize this. When you need to scrape on non stick surfaces, wood is the way to go. I often prefer metal models when they can be safely used also, but this is still a good one to have in your cooking arsenal.\n\nThis set is almost, almost mind you, almost indestructible and could last nearly forever when cared for properly, enough heat or hot oil or,.....will destroy almost anything so use common sense. These are good up to 450 degrees.\n\nThe bottom line is that I can recommend these and if you like today's price, I'd say give'em a try.

The larger spatula is a perfect mix of size, pliability at the tip and sides, and sturdiness for heft, thick frostings, potato salads and such.

They have single-piece exterior construction, so the heads won't come apart from their handles the way some of my silicone spatulas do.  With the three different sizes and shapes, they are versatile tools for the cook/baker.\n\nThese are not silicone all the way through but rather reinforced by what the manufacturer says is steel, with seams along the edges, presumably where the mold was opened.  Both the smallest spatula and one of the larger ones have both a curved side and a straight side -- one for scraping bowls and the other for spreading or getting stuff out of rectangular containers.  The other larger one is more of a spoon and is great for stirring and folding.\n\nThe best part of using silicone spatuals is their ability to withstand high heat, up to 450 degrees.  That means that nothing on the stove will ruin them.  They are dishwasher-safe, although the complete silicone construction means that they are entirely non-stick and therefore easy to wash by hand.  Mine arrived with a few small chunks at some of the seams, but it is not noticeable at first.  These flaws also don't undermine the usefulness of the utensils themselves, thus earning only a 1/2 star deduction.\n\nI can never have too many silicone spatulas and spoons in my kitchen, and this Kembar set is one of my favorites.

There were essentially no seams.\n Has two different size standard shape Spatulas and a large Spoonula (spatula/spoon combo).\n Silicone heads were safe to use with our T-Fal non-stick pans.\n Spatulas were fairly easy to clean, but scrambled eggs did stick a bit and had to be brushed for cleaning after sitting for an hour.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, this is a nice 3-piece silicone spatula set. It has a nice style and a quality build.  They were constructed to be a single piece for each spatula with silicone covering the entire utensil. I tested it out on various foods and they did quite a nice job. They worked well and cleaned up pretty easily, but did need a little scrubbing for some stuck on scrambled eggs that I used the spoonula for. I love a spoonula shaped spatula for eggs because it allows for scraping with the flat edge, but also allows for scooping out of the pan.

I had a light similar to this one under my cabinet for about a year before I gave up on changing out batteries, which is why I was happy to find this particular light with a cord.  There is one small area in my kitchen where the track lighting doesn't hit properly, no matter how I adjust the lights, and it happens to be the counter space most suitable for food prep during stove-top cooking. This Lights of America light is cheap, convenient, bright enough to sufficiently light my counter, lightweight, and was easy to install with some heavy-duty velcro (yep, I used velcro...sophisticated, no...haha. But it'll certainly help when I have to change out the bulb because I could never get the light cover back on this thing without taking it down!).\n\nWith that said, keep in mind that you get what you pay for, and this light was cheap so I wasn't expecting greatness.  My older light that used batteries had thicker plastic casing that felt sturdier when being pressed into place, and it was thinner so that you couldn't see the light at all under the cabinet when it was turned off.  The plastic of the Lights of America light is flimsier, the light case/diffuser is a pain to keep attached to the unit while working with the light (actually, mine STILL isn't completely in place, but no one can tell because it's under the cabinet), and it's bulky-looking, despite the fact that my cabinets have a bottom edge that extends below the bottom shelf by about an inch, providing some cover of the light case but not all.  If you have a gorgeous updated kitchen, keep going with the updates and have a professional install solid lighting that is more stream-lined and blends with your decor.  But if you're like me and simply want extra light to see what you're prepping and aren't ashamed of your 1990s kitchen (hey, it works!), this light works just fine for a temporary solution that doesn't waste batteries like many other cheapo lights do.

So, when an old connector breaks, you have to throw away the old connector and the old metal bracket and replace it with this new bracket.

Steam was escaping from the entire perimeter of the lid.  I had saved the old one, so I tried again using it instead.  Seemed to have worked just fine.\n\nOne tip for all you pressure canner users - do not use too much water in the canner, or make sure it's at a rapid boil BEFORE placing your jars in the canner.  The gasket takes a little time to seal before pressure will build up, as evidenced by the condensation dripping from the perimeter of the lid as steam initially escapes between the gasket, lid & canner.  Once enough pressure has built up, the gasket will eventually seal.  If you start with cool to lukewarm water, it will take a long time before enough steam is generated to effect a good seal.\n\nI suspect this gasket is not made to the exact same specifications as the original.

Couldn't decide between a 4qt and a 6 qt.  I wanted a 6 qt but Amazon forced you to buy Amazon Prime if you wanted the 6 qt and I didn't want that FORCED on me as I don't want Prime Membership right now and didn't want the hassle to quit later.\n\nBut as it turned out the 4 qt is more than enough for one or two people or even if you have a small child.  It's well and simply made and very cheap compared to others out there.  Was not sure about the crude rocking cap but it works, is reliable and simple to  see if the pressure is correct by it's gentle rocking.\n\nOne decision to buy this was the gasket and other rubber seals are cheap to replace.  The other one I looked at and really liked, the gasket and rubber replacements would cost me nearly $18 dollars a year to upkeep paying for another of their Pressure Cookers in only 3 YEARS!!\n\nThe aluminum used is soft and scratches and stains easily and is not hardened i.e anodized.  I wish it was but the cost would go higher too.  But the manual gives a way to remove stains.  Have not tried it as the light stains don't bother me.  I also did NOT detect any aluminum taste with dishes that contain acidic ingredients.  A well-known site tested for aluminum and said it leeches .0025 of aluminum, but said when you take an antacid, one tablet contains 250 mg of aluminum!  Drinking from soda cans can give you 1 or 2 mg of it.\n\nIf that still bothers you go get a stainless-steel one.  But the shape changes compared to the aluminum one even though they have the same capacity.  I think the SS model is flatter and not as tall.\n\nI bought it mostly to cook beans in it and it excels at that.  I tried their bean recipe and it's good as any.  Completely satisfied.  I also use it to cook soups, stews and am still experimenting.  I don't know which is better at the moment for doing the latter as I only had this for a few months.  Whether traditional cooking, i.e. Crockpot (failed at beans unless you buy it canned) or traditional stove, coil or gas.\n\nI can't seem to get the full flavor nuances on the latter when using the Pressure Cooker, however, strangely, we did gobble up everything made by it.  Cabbage in soup gets overcooked, though, as this is powerful and and has only one setting at 15 lbs.  Perhaps delicate herbs and flavoring get smothered by the extreme pressure?  Maybe not either, as I'm still experimenting in amounts and may take me a year or more to determine the truth, as I don't use fresh herbs and tend to customize my recipes on the fly.\n\nI might add, also, it has a strangely very comfortable handle.\n\nSee you in one year. ;)", "summary": "Will Do In A Pinch", "unixReviewTime": 1524441600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2018", "reviewerID": "A1TINW4RXWQPNH", "asin": "B00002N601", "style": {"Size:": " 6 qt"}, "reviewerName": "Gustavo Q Mastroianni", "reviewText": "Worked as expected.", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1524441600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2018", "reviewerID": "A39YU2G9YGNXL9", "asin": "B00002N601", "style": {"Size:": " 8 qt"}, "reviewerName": "Kelly Rae delo", "reviewText": "Nice pressure cooker, love it!", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1524355200}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 14, 2015", "reviewerID": "A1U0O6SACUYPQL", "asin": "B00002N62X", "style": {"Package Quantity:": " 1"}, "reviewerName": "Pt", "reviewText": "Work great.", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1423872000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2016", "reviewerID": "A23WCCTK1384WV", "asin": "B00002N636", "style": {"Size:": " 3 Bags"}, "reviewerName": "M.

Some have even cracked and broke as a result of the heat and friction created when the motor is running. It all depends on the type--and quality--of the rubber folks.  There is a reason manufacturers recommend sticking with genuine replacement parts.  Though generic belts/bags *may* fill the void, my experience has always been less than positive.  These fit my 30+ year old Eureka upright perfectly and make it run like new once again.  I also refuse to part with this machine because I firmly believe it outperforms many of the newer models on the market today.  What's more, the maintenance and design of these older vacuums are such that you can usually do the work yourself.  If you understand how these vacuums work and are mechanically inclined, they are virtually maintenance free.  There is literally nothing that can go wrong on these machines except the belt and the occasional light burnout.  I generally need to change my mine roughly every 2-3 months depending on use.  Also, carpets with tassels and loose threads wreak havoc on these things--get rid of them.  They are nothing but a nuisance anyway.

I use these to pull cool night air through the house.  They are set up in windows in one room, and at night I open other windows in the house a few inches each.  Used on exhaust, this fan can pull a lot of air though the house overnight, in fact it is usually downright chilly before dawn!  I'm home most days, so if it's going to be warmer than mid seventies during the day, I let the house cool off as much as it can overnight and just dress warmly in the morning, then change into something cooler as the house warms up later in the day.  The $$ I've saved in electric bills more than makes up for the trouble of changing clothes or taking off a fleece cardigan.\n\nI turn off the fans and close all the windows as soon as the temps start to rise in the morning, and since my house is fairly well insulated the house stays comfortably cool most of, if not all day, and then I open windows and turn the fans back on late evening when it becomes cooler outside than inside.  Using this fan, and even more so with the second one added, I only need air conditioning during the late afternoon of the hottest days.  I've cut my summer electricity bill back tremendously; the first fan more than paid for itself with the first electric bill.\n\nThis isn't a quiet fan on it's high setting, but any fan moving this much air is going to be noisy.  On low I consider it a nice white noise loudness level for sleeping.  The fan is all plastic, and are perhaps a bit pricey for such, but it does move much, much more air than the box fans I've had in windows in the past, and as I've said, it can quickly more than pay for itself in power savings.  I'm seriously considering purchasing a third one to keep on hand for future use if/when one of mine breaks down, as the second was supposed to be mostly a backup but it's made enough of a difference that it's being used regularly with the first fan; if I'd thought the second would be such a difference I'd have purchased it long ago.

It looked like a nice place to live and about six months later, I was wondering if I had made the right decision.\n\nFirst of all, there wasn't much circulation of air in the summer.  All the windows were on the West side...one in the bathroom, two in the living room and one in the kitchen/dining area and if the wind was coming from any direction that wasn't West, it could pretty steamy in the place.\n\nLooking on the bright side though, I knew that Winter would be here in a few months and then things would be different.  Oh boy, as it turned out, the *things would be different* comment was a vast under-statement.\n\nBack to Summer...and the fact that I hated all the heat in my apartment.\n\nI thought that maybe I should get a window fan or two to get some of that air moving.  That's when I stumbled onto this 16\" fan from Lasko.  I did as much research as I could and finally decided to make the purchase.  As it turned out, it was one of my better decisions!\n\nWhen the fan got here, I took it out of the box and read the owners manual from front to back.  Then, I looked at the window and then back at the fan and wondered if it was going to fit.  It looked BIG!  And the window looked, well...NOT big.  So I opened the window as far as it would go and simply popped the unit right in except for a half inch gap on the top.  So I carefully pulled the window down until there was sort of a nice snug fit.\n\nHowever, there was a large gap on the right side, even after I pulled out the extension on the unit.  But heck, being wildly resourceful, I just found some durable cardboard and after measuring the window and cutting the cardboard to size, I just snapped it in and had a perfect fit!  Cool!\n\nBut, as I checked out my work, I saw a lot more small gaps and that just wasn't acceptable cuz I needed kind of a vacum around the fan unit to be able to draw the air from the bathroom window, all the way through the apartment to the fan in the dining area.\n\nAs luck would have it, I found a gob of Homer Hankies from when the Minnesota Twins won the World Series and I wondered if it would be sacrilegious if I would use them to fill in the final gaps around the fan unit.  Well no it wouldn't, I convinced myself and besides...Who's gonna know?  I'm certainly not going to go blabbing about it down at the local watering hole.  So...that was that!\n\nBy now, I was sweating profusely so I figured it was time to cool off a little and as long as there was this half a whole house fan just sitting there in the window...why not give it a try?  Eh?  So I set the fan on Low and hit the switch and GEEEZ!...the effect was almost, immediate!  There was a lot of air coming from the bathroom and I cooled down right now.  And I was happy, again.\n\nThen, Winter showed up and I thought I would have to remove the fan and store it till next Summer.  But, then the so called free heat from the steam radiators came on and as long as it was waaay late Fall and about three degrees above zero, it was kind of comfortable in here, even though the exhaust fan was still running.  Then, wouldn't you know it?  A few days later the outside temp went up to sixty degrees and I figured it was time to shut off the heater valves.\n\nWell, because this building is almost one hundred years old, I think the heater valves are the originals that came with the radiators and when I tried to shut them off, I discovered that they were already off and when the temp in my apartment got up to 92 degrees, I turned the exhaust fan up to medium in self defense.\n\nAll that stuff was...back in the bad old days and that poor fan has run non-stop for almost six years, until a few months ago when it started to groan a little and I started to panic.  So, I went to Amazon and found the exact fan and ordered it...again! then I removed a few phillps screws from the frame part, unplugged the old fan and pulled it out.  Then I put the new fan in and put in the screws and plugged it in.\n\nAwesome!! Now I should be in good shape for another five or six years.  What a great gadget, this fan is.  That fan bearing is incredibly durable.

I suppose one couldn't expect more air movement for it's size and cost.\n- The \"storm guard\" feature is really nice. I like being able to leave it installed and still shut the window when needed.\n- As it is \"mounted\" in a window, the fan really needs to be reversible, and this one is.\n\nThe bad:\n- After a few months it developed a terribly obnoxious rattle. At first I assume a loose screw/washer that I could tighten down. I disassembled the fan and simply can't find the culprit so I now suspect a bad bearing someplace.

This is truly a whole-house fan for me!  Completely turns over the entire house air in a matter of seconds. The direction of air flow (intake/exhaust) changes with a simple manual turn-knob.  There is a BIG difference between low/medium/high settings, which enables you to customize air flow to your liking.  Since the knob is manually operated, there are no complex, computerized electronics to malfunction.

This is a purely simple, incredibly well designed, powerful window fan.\n\nSpace usage / appearance:  It lies flat, on the back side / up against your window (this design is what allows you to slide the window closed- & locked- behind it).  In the front, the grill (& center control knob) extends out into the room about 7\".  The side panels offer great privacy.  The entire unit is off-white / cream-colored / neutral.  It looks retro-designer/ mid-century, a bit industrial-looking maybe.  I've searched for 17 years, & this is by FAR the best fan I've ever found.  Worth every penny & more.

I have kept 2 to 3 running at any given time between the months of March and November whenever possible/necessary.  This fan is one of 3 that work without flaws. We've tried to repair the others, cleaned them every year, to no avail.  Once the motor fails, that's it.  In fact, one of the first one's threw a fan blade which was quite loud.\n\nTo deal with simple vibration, we devised a system involving thin strips of wood for the bottoms and 2x6s on the sides to provide a solid, semi-permanent gap fillers.  I painted the wood to match the room paint and it seems to work well.  Our windows are of the cheap variety (drywall with alum. windows wedged into place, no frames).\n\nI might have sprung for the next size up, but I couldn't afford the 100 bucks, not to mention, the motors wouldn't match up with the one's I'd purchased so far, IMO.  I just waited until amazon.com was selling this and pounced on it (due to the low price). I'm happy with these and will probably continue to purchase these if they are still made.  These fans really move the air in our house and I firmly believe they do work better when at least two are involved (one in, one on out or sometimes both on out with other windows in the house open) I'm lucky to have double doors in the \"two fans room\" that open up to allow a wide birth for the air to flow through.\n\nSmall footnote: I did try ordering one from another good online store, but when that one arrived, the control knob fell off in shipment and wouldn't stay on.  Seemed cheaply made.  The one from amazon.com that arrive recently is intact and running smoothly, oddly with no vibration.\n\nUPDATE comment: as of 8/13/11 another of our fan's motors is acting up and I may have a theory about that.  Please comment to this review if you think this could be it.  I use non-aerosol hairspray (on my hair) in the room where the fan is.  Only fans that drew the air from the room were affected.  Just in the last two years we turned the fan direction to BOTH fans OUT in the room with two windows and the rest of the house windows open.  The hairspray presumably will end up being drawn up by the fans, especially the one I am standing 10 feet away from and right in line with.  In prior years, that fan was set up to allow air in, not out, for room re-circulation.  So in that case it was blowing the spray away from the fan.  However the other fan, further to the side in the second window (blowing out) was always the fan that developed motor problems; it would just bind up.  Opinions? (I have tried google.com to search for this possibility, to no avail).\n\nUPDATE 6/30/2015: Looks like I'm down to just 2 Lasko 2155a fans. One of the two was purchased in 2011, the other, 2014. Of the remaining 3 that I had, one just stopped spinning (hair spray issue, no doubt AND NO WAY TO OPEN IT UP ENTIRELY!).. The two others both screech constantly, so loud that i just want to pitch the things into the garbage. We took them apart, clean, lubed, oiled, you name it. NOTHING WORKS.\n\nTherefore, I am labeling this fan a total LEMON. I did everything possible to prevent damage occurring to them, like going to a enclosed room to hairspray my hair. The biggest complaint of all (the only one that I will mention now) is that you can't open the thing up and do minor surgery. Remember the old days when you could do that? I have a little fan from those days that still works! Today, they are probably made so that you have to buy a new motor every 5 years, AT A COST HIGHER THAN THE FAN ITSELF (inc. shipping.).\n\nSo, before my only 2 fans die, I have to go out and find another one, but I have a hunch that most of the stuff out there is crap anyway.", "summary": "Still the best window/house fan, WAIT...2015 UPDATE", "unixReviewTime": 1312416000}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "07 24, 2011", "reviewerID": "A3OAIYOVY9U2U9", "asin": "B00002N5Z9", "style": {"Size:": " Window Fan", "Package Quantity:": " 1"}, "reviewerName": "M. White", "reviewText": "Years ago in a townhouse I had a whole house fan.  I'd open all the windows a couple of inches in the evening, turn the fan on and feel the air move upstairs and be pulled out of the house by the fan. This fan is advertised as a reversible window fan and I purchased it for a 450 square foot upstairs room.  I put it in one window and on the opposite side of the room, about 23 feet away, I open the other window fully.  On an evening where there is no incoming breeze, with this set up as described above and the fan on high, I can stand 8 feet away from the open window and when it is on high, reverse speed, I can very obviously feel the air being pulled in through the open window outside. If I feel it at that point, I know it's circulating the room air and eventually pulling the warm air out. I recommend using it in this manner; if you just set it on reverse and don't open another nearby window sufficiently to pull in cool air, you might not think this is working.  In a sense, it works like a whole house fan.  Is it one? - no, it's not going to pull cool air in through your entire house unless it's a very small house.\n\nOn high speed, I find this fan to be less noisy than the average 19\" box fan on high speed. It runs smoothly and I've been using it for a few weeks now.  The shipping box was left on my porch with the corners crushed and I was initially concerned about whether I'd find the unit itself damaged and happily that was not an issue.  As some other reviewers have written, the knob to adjust the speed was not put on very securely by the manufacturer, but for a fan that performs like this at a price under $70, I'm willing to pull out the crazy glue.

Moving it back and forth from one side to the other is a huge pain, but it results in a sort of less-dramatic Sophie's Choice: do we leave the AC in the bedroom so we can actually sleep, or leave it in the living room/kitchen so that we can actually get things done without dying of heatstroke? So that's why I bought this fan--to help move air in the kitchen/living area and hopefully make both rooms habitable during the heat. I haven't gotten the chance to test it during a major heat wave yet (hopefully I won't NEED to *crosses fingers*) but so far, I could not be more pleased with how well it works.\n\nWhat I love the most about it is the versatility. It is nearly silent on the \"low\" settings, but when you set it on \"high,\" it moves a LOT of air. The fact that you can flip back and forth between intake and exhaust is really one of the selling points--it's super-handy in our combined kitchen/living room because, when my partner is cooking, we can flip it on to draw out a lot of the heat it produces. If we open up all the rooms, it helps a lot with cross-ventilation--way more than the box fan we were using previously. In addition, our old building has huge radiators which produce a TON of heat in the winter, and the exhaust function, when placed in a window near the radiator, helps a lot with keeping it from becoming too hot in here. Bonus! Basically, it does everything I hoped it would do, and a couple of things I didn't even anticipate.\n\nI also love the way it's shaped--it fits nicely in the windowframe, and has a cute retro appeal. It's front-heavy, but still quite easy to move. It's also easy to take apart and put back together for cleaning, which is a HUGE plus.\n\nMy only complaints, all of which are extremely minor:\n-I wish it were a little flatter, just because now we can't really close the indoor shutters on that window, but that's an unusual situation (most people probably don't have those!) and I won't fault the design for it.\n-I'm a little concerned about the switch--it seems a bit flimsy and I'm afraid it'll break if I turn it with too much enthusiasm. But, so far, so good!\n-while it's pretty quiet, it does make a distinctive noise on the exhaust setting.

One upstairs, one downstairs, both set to exhaust. I'd have more of these if I had another window in the house small enough to accept the fan.\n\nJust in case you haven't thought about this subject before, it's a lot easier to suck hot air out of a room with an exhaust fan than it is to push cool air in to the room. Using an exhaust fan works much better than just opening a window wide and hoping cool air will blow in eventually.\n\nFor summer evenings, as soon as it's cooler outside than inside, exhaust fans are the bomb.\n\nPlace this fan properly in a window, so that the fan and its casing cover the entire open window area. Then open another nearby window just a few inches, and feel the cool breeeze blowing in. When I have both fans going and the patio sliding door open 6 inches you can feel the breeze 6 feet inside. It takes only about 2 hours from jump to cool my 2500 sq ft house to outside levels with both fans going. I've had to put them on timers to stop at 2am or it gets too cold.\n\nSo why is this a great exhaust fan?\n\nIt's not the Rolls Royce of fans. It's a good fan at a great price. You can pay 3x what this one usually costs ($50 to $80) for only marginal improvements in performance. True, it's not built like a Sherman tank but it's built plenty well enough to do its job. (I like that--you know what they say, An engineer is someone who knows how to build a bridge that barely stands, but it does stand.)\n\nSome notes:\n\nIf your window opens side to side, the height of the window on the inside ledge should be at least 26.5 inches and less than 34 inches. You need to be able to open the window at least 18 inches wide, preferably 20. They say this is a 16 inch fan, but that's the blade width. The basket is a little over 18 inches. You can screw the fan into the window, if your wife will let you. For some reason wives seem to object more to screw heads sticking out in the horizontal plane of a window than the vertical. It will work just fine to wedge the fan by turning it 90 degrees and extending the side panels appropriately. The side panels can be precisely set--they have two screws on each side. You may want to put some foam rubber or other soft material along the edge of the panels to reduce vibration--I didn't find it necessary.\n\nIf your window opens top to bottom, then the width of the inside window ledge should be at least 26.5 inches and less than 34 inches, and you should be able to open the window in such a way that the height of the opening is no more than 21 inches, 22 at the most. You can wedge the fan in this kind of window too, if screws still don't pass the wife test.\n\nIf you use screws, use the template included with the fan, and try hard to be precise, leaving about 1/16 of an inch of space at the bottom when the fan is set in. The fan has a clever keyhole scheme for hanging it in the window, similar to the keyhole opening you use when hanging a picture on a single nail. Take the keyhole length into account when using the template or be ready to put paper towels or felt/foam rubber under the fan to stop rattle.\n\nAt highest speed the fan isn't annoying--you can sleep with it in the same room if you're not a person who's bugged by white noise. At low speed, it's very quiet.\n\nIt moves a lot of air. My biggest challenge is getting my wife to buy into the idea that opening one window 6 inches will cool the room faster than opening it all the way. The idea is to get a breeze sucked into the house, instead of having cool air just mill around at window boundaries.\n\nMy fans have been going now for 4 years with no signs of quitting. But I did just buy another one as a backup. No reflection on the fan, I'm just one of Those Guys.\n\nBe careful with the wings that extend to fit the window. They're not unduly flimsy, but they are a little flimsy. I broke one already. Another commenter worried about getting out of a window in case of a fire if the fans were screwed in. My take is that an adrenaline-charged 6 year old would have no problem flinging this fan across the room when screwed in. If you're worried, wedge.\n\nDespite what I've said about noise and vibration, the fan is nicely balanced and not prone to excess vibration. You have to do some work mounting it correctly, but it's simple work for anyone if you relax and do it right. Get a level and a glass of wine, and you'll be fine.\n\nYou will have to clean your window screens. Kind of like replacing your furnace filters. Depending on how dusty your area is, you may have to do it more than once a year.\n\nIt is nice to be able to shut the window without moving the fan. Ours stay in the windows year round.\n\nBottom line: if it gets cool enough at night in the summer where you live that you wish you could sleep outside because the house stays hot, this fan is for you, if you have windows that can fit it.", "summary": "Great exhaust fan value", "unixReviewTime": 1274572800}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2010", "reviewerID": "A2L7OHHLE13LYA", "asin": "B00002N5Z9", "reviewerName": "Tom", "reviewText": "I live in a 1400 sq ft 3 bedroom condo in San Diego.

Newhouse", "reviewText": "I was looking for a fan that would really draw fresh air into my apartment (5 rooms, total ~1000sq ft).  It's very frustrating to me when it's nice and cool outside on a summer evening, but still sticky and stuffy inside from the heat of the day.  I've tried two of the little twin window fans, a larger oscillating fan on a stand, and small round fans in windows, but even all these of those in combination never really seemed to make a big difference in a reasonable amount of time.  I've been in houses with attic-mounted whole-house fans, and it's amazing how quickly they'll exchange the air in a whole house!  That's the effect I was hoping for.\nIn short, this Lasko 2155a has met my expectations.  If I turn it on high exhaust, open a couple windows on the opposite end of the apartment, and close the rest, it does a great job of pulling in fresh (cool!) air.  Of course it's not as fast or as powerful as a real attic whole-house fan, but especially given the price, convenience, and simple installation, it's a pretty good substitute.  It shouldn't even be in the same category as the little twin window fans - those are good for a single room, but they don't hold a candle to this Lasko.  When this is running on high exhaust, and with only a few other windows open, there's a noticeable breeze coming in those windows.  I notice a distinct change in the coolness and \"freshness\" of the inside air after only a few minutes.  It is pretty loud when it's on high, but it's not the obtrusive roar that I've seen described in other reviews.  I wouldn't want to sit right next to it and have a conversation or listen to music, but if you're in the next room, it's really not distractingly loud.  Also, I find it's helpful to leave this on high for a few (10-15?) minutes, and then turning it to low does a fine job of maintaining the fresh air inside.  When it's on low, the noise isn't bad at all - it's quieter than the oscillating stand fan I'd use otherwise.  Not distracting or bothersome, even if you're in the same room.\nSo if you live in a small house or apartment, and you're looking for a reasonably-priced alternative to a full attic fan, I highly recommend this one!", "summary": "Great fan!

As with all aluminum pressure cookers,  the metal will react with some foods and can overheat if you are not careful.

In the past few years I am always looking for time saving things for the kitchen.  There are many foods that my family and I like that require a lot of cooking time.  The pressure cooker has been great for cooking dried beans, fresh green beans, vegetables like carrots, beets, etc. for making bisque, the list goes on.  This cooker has made the weekdays easier for me. I'm gone from 6:15am to 4:15pm every weekday not leaving a lot of time for preparing meals.\nThis pressure cooker does not have a gauge and the weight is not marked 5, 10, 15 as I remember pressure cookers having.  It has an instruction booklet with it.  It contains suggested cooking time.  It does have a gasket.  It is always a good idea to check and make sure it is in place before cooking.  It has a safety release rubber valve that will blow out should it gain too much pressure.  It also has a release valve at the handle that drops so that you know it is safe to remove the weight on top.\nI did actually can some pints of salsa with it.  It will hold three pints without one touching the other.  I did not try any quarts in it.\nWhen it first came I didn't take it out of the box for over a month.  Sad I let it go to waste that long.  I've used it at least a couple times a week since opening it though.  I have had no problems with it what so ever.  It is a good all around cooker.\nMy next pressure cooker will have the marked pressure weight and/or gauge.

I bought it to replace an elderly 4-quart Mirro that I'd adored but ruined by forgetting to grease the lid gasket one day (never, ever again). I do love the extra handle on the side of this one -- in fact, that extra handle, combined with my fond feelings for my old one, were why I picked this pot.\n\nSo. Big mistake.\n\nI hate the shape -- for some reason it's tall and narrow instead of shaped like an ordinary pot (like my old 4-qt Mirro, for that matter). So this one fits the little burners of an electric stove but not the large front burner where one you'd normally want to use it. That leaves plenty of burner uncovered for you to accidentally burn other stuff on, yourself included. (Joy.) Also the weird shape makes it nigh impossible to brown your roast in this pan; you have to brown it in a separate skillet then stuff it into this thing sideways. And, yeah, the chickens stand on end.\n\nAlso, I burned several roasts before I figured out this pot's dumb secret: Pressure can't build inside unless the red lock-button on the handle pops up, but the red button will never pop up without assistance from *you.* You have to babysit this puppy; when water starts bubbling from underneath the lid and running down the sides to fizzle on the burner, it's time to start poking and prodding that stupid button again. I use a toothpick for this chore, but YMMV. (And, yes, I've used compressed air to blow around this button after washing. Nothing works. It just sticks.)\n\nSo, long story short, if you don't want to burn your food or blow up your kitchen, you have to stay nearby while this pot's heating up and once it starts leaking, poke-poke-pry until the button pops up. It won't work on its own.\n\nAnyhoo, I'll try to upload an in-action photo. You'll see bare burner sticking out underneath the base, streaks down the side from where the water's run out under the lid, and the red button sticking up -- after I'd forced it into position.

As one reviewer has indicated, it's hard to keep the filter housing from leaking. It's really due to the poor finish inside the opening into which the filter cannister is screwed. There are some rough seams that prevent the o-ring from seating perfectly. Minor adjustments are needed to obtain a leak-free fitting. BUT - and this is what they don't tell you - the unit has a life of FIVE years. Omni says that after five years, the plastic parts (that's every part, folks) will have degraded to the point of imminent failure.
